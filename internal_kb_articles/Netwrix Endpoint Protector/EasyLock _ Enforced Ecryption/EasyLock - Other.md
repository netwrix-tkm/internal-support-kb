### Issue Recognition & Triage  
#### Symptoms to Identify  
- Errors during EasyLock deployment (e.g., "Easy Lock Expired").  
- Password-related issues (e.g., incorrect master password, inability to reset passwords).  
- Problems with remote wiping functionality or file access.  
- Unexpected behavior in EasyLock functionality (e.g., re-prompting for password setup).  
- Compatibility issues with storage devices or operating systems.  

#### Priority Assessment  
- **High Priority**: Security-related issues (e.g., unauthorized access, encryption failures).  
- **Medium Priority**: Functional limitations affecting usability (e.g., inability to open multiple files).  
- **Low Priority**: Cosmetic or expected behaviors misunderstood by users.
