# Netwrix Endpoint Protector Knowledge Base: File Tracing Issues in Reports & Analysis

## Overview
The **File Tracing** feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector allows administrators to monitor user activity related to file sharing and access. This functionality is critical for ensuring data security, compliance, and visibility into file operations across endpoints. However, misunderstandings about its capabilities, particularly regarding file downloads and platform-specific limitations, can lead to confusion. This guide provides a systematic approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues related to File Tracing, with a focus on Reports & Analysis logs.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **File Tracing**: Tracks file operations such as sharing, copying, and accessing files on endpoints. It provides visibility into user activity but does not allow direct file downloads.
- **File Shadowing**: If enabled, creates a small copy of the document on the server for auditing purposes. These copies are not full replicas and may not be accessible in the same way as the original files.
- **Platform-Specific Features**: While File Tracing is supported on both Windows and Mac systems, certain functionalities may differ. For example, documentation often emphasizes Windows features, which can lead to confusion for Mac users.

### System Context
- **Reports & Analysis Logs**: The File Tracing tab in the Reports & Analysis section is the primary interface for viewing user activity related to file operations.
- **Mac vs. Windows Compatibility**: Ensure customers understand the feature set available for their specific platform.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Customers report difficulty identifying files shared from endpoints.
- Customers expect the ability to download files directly from the File Tracing interface.
- Confusion arises due to discrepancies between documentation and platform-specific functionality.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: If the issue involves potential data security risks or compliance violations.
- **Medium Priority**: If the issue is related to feature understanding or documentation discrepancies.
- **Low Priority**: General inquiries about feature capabilities.

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Clarify the Customer's Expectations**:
   - Ask if they are expecting to download files or simply view activity logs.
   - Determine if they are aware of platform-specific limitations.

2. **Verify Platform and Version**:
   - Confirm whether the customer is using Windows or Mac systems.
   - Check the product version to ensure compatibility with the requested feature.

3. **Review Documentation**:
   - Direct the customer to the relevant section of the user manual (e.g., Chapter 5.7.3 for File Tracing).
   - Highlight any platform-specific notes.

4. **Check Feature Configuration**:
   - Verify if File Tracing is enabled and properly configured.
   - Determine if file shadowing is enabled and explain its implications.

5. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Request and review Reports & Analysis logs to identify user activity related to file operations.
