# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Reports & Analysis - Logs (EPP Server - Other)

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to the "Reports & Analysis - Logs" component of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) with a focus on the "EPP Server - Other" feature. This category encompasses challenges related to log generation, shadow copy functionality, and domain-specific configurations. Understanding these issues is critical for ensuring accurate logging, effective shadow copy retrieval, and seamless customer experiences.

## Technical Background
Netwrix Endpoint Protector is a data loss prevention (DLP) solution that monitors and controls data transfers across endpoints. Key features include:
- **Shadow Copy**: Captures copies of files and data for monitoring and auditing purposes.
- **Allowedlist Functionality**: Excludes specific domains or entities from logging to reduce noise and focus on relevant data.
- **File Shadows Repository**: Manages the storage and accessibility of shadow copies.

### Key Terminology
- **Shadow Copy**: A copy of data (e.g., files, emails) captured during transfer for auditing purposes.
- **Allowedlist**: A configuration that excludes specified domains or entities from logging.
- **Content Aware Policy (CAP)**: Policies that define how data is monitored and logged.
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: A method for analyzing data packets to enforce policies.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Common Symptoms
- Logs are generated for domains or entities that the customer wants to exclude.
- Shadow copies are not accessible for specific applications or scenarios.
- Unexpected behavior in logging or shadow copy retrieval.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Shadow copies are inaccessible for critical applications or sensitive data.
- **Medium Priority**: Logs are generated for excluded domains, causing noise in reports.
- **Low Priority**: General inquiries about configuration or functionality.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Understand the Problem**: Gather detailed information about the issue, including the affected domain, application, or functionality.
2. **Review Configurations**: Examine the Content Aware Policy, Allowedlist, and File Shadows Repository settings.
3. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to replicate the behavior in a controlled environment.
4. **Analyze Logs**: Review system logs to identify anomalies or misconfigurations.
5. **Test Adjustments**: Modify configurations (e.g., Allowedlist or repository settings) to observe changes in behavior.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
- What specific domain, application, or data transfer is affected?
- Have any recent changes been made to the Allowedlist or shadow copy settings?
- Are there any error messages or unexpected logs?
- What version of Endpoint Protector is being used?

### Data to Collect
- Screenshots of the Content Aware Policy and Allowedlist configurations.
- Logs from the Reports & Analysis module.
- Details about the affected application or domain.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Excluding a Domain from Logging
- **Symptom**: Logs are generated for a domain the customer wants to exclude.
- **Root Cause**: The domain is not added to the Allowedlist.
- **Solution**:
  1. Navigate to the Content Aware Policy settings.
  2. Add the domain to the Allowedlist.
  3. Verify that logs are no longer generated for the domain.

### Scenario 2: Shadow Copy Inaccessible for Specific Applications
- **Symptom**: Shadow copies are not accessible for files uploaded via a specific application (e.g., WhatsApp Desktop).
- **Root Cause**: File Shadows Repository settings prevent access to shadow copies.
- **Solution**:
  1. Disable the File Shadows Repository (Externalize File Shadows).
  2. Test shadow copy retrieval for the affected application.
  3. Confirm that the issue is resolved.

## Detailed Case Studies
