# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Content Aware Reports in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

Content Aware Reports in Netwrix Endpoint Protector provide critical insights into data movement and usage, enabling organizations to monitor and prevent data loss. This category of issues focuses on troubleshooting problems related to incomplete or inaccurate reporting, false positives, and challenges with policy validation. Understanding and resolving these issues is essential for maintaining the integrity of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) measures and ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Content Aware Reports**: A feature that tracks and reports on data movement, including file uploads, downloads, and transfers, to ensure compliance with DLP policies.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: A security strategy to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration or exposure.
- **Reporting V2**: An enhanced reporting mechanism that provides improved visibility and accuracy in logs and reports.
- **False Positives**: Instances where benign actions are incorrectly flagged as policy violations, leading to unnecessary alerts.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector**: A DLP solution that monitors endpoints for data movement and enforces policies to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Policies and Dictionaries**: Configurations that define what constitutes sensitive data (e.g., bank account numbers, credit card details) and how it should be monitored.
- **Logs and Reports**: The primary tools for analyzing data movement and identifying potential policy violations.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Missing destination details in reports for file uploads.
- Excessive false positives in data at rest or data in motion reports.
- Customer dissatisfaction due to manual effort required to validate policies and clear false positives.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Missing critical reporting details that impact compliance or security monitoring.
- **Medium Priority**: High volume of false positives causing operational inefficiencies.
- **Low Priority**: General dissatisfaction with product features or usability.

## Diagnostic Methodology

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Confirm the version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector in use.
   - Verify whether Reporting V2 is enabled.
   - Review the customer's policies and dictionaries for potential misconfigurations.

2. **Log Analysis**:
   - Collect and analyze logs to identify patterns or anomalies.
   - Look for missing fields (e.g., destination details) or excessive false positives.

3. **Policy Review**:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and dictionaries.
   - Identify potential gaps or overly broad configurations.

4. **Customer Communication**:
   - Schedule calls to understand the customer's environment and expectations.
   - Provide interim guidance while investigating the root cause.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Missing Destination Details in Reports
- **Symptoms**: Reports lack destination details for file uploads.
- **Root Cause**: Reporting V2 was disabled, and monitoring of text/plain files caused false positives.
- **Solution**:
  1. Enable Reporting V2 to improve reporting accuracy.
  2. Inform the customer about the fix for text/plain file monitoring in version 5.9.5.0.
  3. Advise the customer to monitor new logs post-update for improved visibility.

### Scenario 2: Excessive False Positives
- **Symptoms**: High volume of false positives in data at rest and data in motion reports.
- **Root Cause**: Ineffective policies and lack of feedback mechanisms for report entries.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review and refine policies to reduce false positives.
  2. Create dictionaries for sensitive data (e.g., bank accounts, credit cards).
  3. Provide a crash course to the customer on reviewing and clearing bad data.
