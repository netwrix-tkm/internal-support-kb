# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Reports & Analysis / Logs Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to the "Reports & Analysis / Logs" component within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform. These issues often involve requests for compliance documentation or problems with file shadowing functionality. Understanding and resolving these issues is critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring the platform operates as intended.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector**: A data loss prevention (DLP) solution designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Reports & Analysis / Logs**: This component provides detailed logs and reports for monitoring and auditing purposes, including shadow file functionality and compliance documentation.
- **Shadow Files**: Copies of files created during data transfer or modification for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **Minimum Baseline Security Standard (MBSS)**: A compliance document outlining security protocols and best practices.

### System Context
- Shadow files are uploaded and stored temporarily before being available for download.
- Compliance documents like MBSS are essential for customers to ensure adherence to security standards.
- Issues in this category often stem from either missing documentation or delays in file processing.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Identifying Issues
- **Documentation Requests**: Customers may request compliance-related documents, such as MBSS, which are not readily accessible.
- **Shadow File Errors**: Customers may report errors like "File not found. File shadow upload is in progress. Please retry later."

### Assessing Priority
- **High Priority**: Issues affecting compliance or critical business operations (e.g., missing MBSS documentation).
- **Medium Priority**: Temporary delays in shadow file uploads that do not impact immediate business needs.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify the Issue**: Confirm the customer's report and gather initial details.
2. **Check System Status**: Investigate the status of shadow file uploads or the availability of requested documentation.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Review relevant logs for errors or delays in processing.
4. **Engage the Customer**: Collect additional information about their environment and recent changes.
5. **Implement Solutions**: Apply the appropriate resolution strategy based on findings.

### Decision Points
- If the issue involves missing documentation, locate and verify the document's compliance.
- If the issue involves shadow file errors, determine whether the upload process is complete or blocked.

## Information Collection
### Customer Queries
- **For Documentation Requests**:
  - What specific document is required (e.g., MBSS)?
  - Is the document needed for compliance or auditing purposes?
- **For Shadow File Issues**:
  - What is the exact error message displayed?
  - Are there specific files or incidents affected?
  - Have there been any recent changes to the system or file size settings?

### Logs and Data to Examine
- **Shadow File Logs**: Check for upload status, errors, or delays.
- **System Configuration**: Verify file size limits and upload settings.
- **Documentation Repository**: Confirm the availability of requested compliance documents.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Missing Compliance Documentation

- **Symptoms**: Error message stating "File not found. File shadow upload is in progress. Please retry later."
- **Resolution**:
  1. Verify the status of shadow file uploads.
  2. Ensure the upload process completes successfully.
  3. Confirm file size compatibility with shadowing settings.
  4. Advise the customer to retry downloading once the upload is finalized.
- **Prevention**: Monitor shadow file uploads during high-traffic periods and optimize file size settings.
