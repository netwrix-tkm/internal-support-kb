# Netwrix Endpoint Protector Knowledge Base: Troubleshooting File Activity Log Issues in the Device Control Module

## Overview

This guide focuses on troubleshooting issues related to file activity logs in the Device Control module of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (DLP server). File activity logging is a critical feature for monitoring and auditing data transfers across connected devices. Understanding and resolving issues in this category ensures the integrity of data loss prevention measures and compliance with organizational security policies.

This document provides a systematic approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues where file activity logs are not displayed or captured on the DLP server.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Device Control Module**: A component of the DLP server that manages and monitors device connections, including USB drives, smartphones, and other portable devices.
- **File Tracing**: A feature that logs file activity (e.g., file transfers, modifications) on connected devices.
- **CAP Driver**: A critical driver responsible for enabling file tracing functionality by capturing file activity data from connected devices.
- **ZapEPP Tool**: A utility used to completely remove remnants of a previous DLP server installation to ensure a clean environment for reinstallation.

### System Context
- **Supported Device Categories**: Windows Portable Devices (Media Transfer Protocol), Android Smartphones (Media Transfer Protocol), Smartphones (USB Sync, Windows CE), and Bluetooth Smartphones.
- **On-Premises Deployment**: The DLP server is hosted on-premises, requiring manual configuration and maintenance.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- File activity logs are not displayed on the DLP server for connected devices.
- Devices are detected as connected, but no file tracing data is captured.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: If the issue affects critical compliance or security monitoring.
- **Medium Priority**: If the issue is isolated to non-critical devices or environments.
- **Low Priority**: If the issue is intermittent and does not impact overall monitoring.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Step 1: Verify Device Control Configuration
- Confirm that the Device Control module is enabled and configured for the affected device categories.
- Check if file tracing is explicitly enabled for the connected devices.

### Step 2: Validate Device Connection
- Ensure that the devices in question are properly connected and recognized by the DLP server.
- Use the DLP server interface to confirm the connection status.

### Step 3: Check Driver Status
- Investigate whether the CAP driver is loaded and functioning correctly.
- Use diagnostic tools or system logs to verify driver initialization during server startup.

### Step 4: Examine Log Files
- Check if log files are being generated but are stuck in quarantine or inaccessible due to permissions issues.

### Step 5: Engage Development Team (if needed)
- If the CAP driver is not loading or there are unexplained errors, escalate to the development team for further analysis.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
1. What device categories are affected (e.g., USB, smartphone)?
2. Are the devices detected as connected in the DLP server interface?
3. Has the DLP server been recently updated or reinstalled?
4. Are there any error messages or logs indicating driver or configuration issues?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- DLP server configuration files.
- System logs showing driver initialization.
- Device connection logs.
- Screenshots of the DLP server interface showing the issue.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: CAP Driver Not Loading
- **Symptoms**: Devices are detected, but no file activity logs are captured.
- **Resolution**: Reinstall the DLP server using the ZapEPP tool to ensure a clean environment. Verify that the CAP driver loads correctly during installation.

### Scenario 2: Log Files Stuck in Quarantine
- **Symptoms**: Log files are generated but not visible in the DLP server interface.
- **Resolution**: Check quarantine settings and permissions. Release the logs or adjust permissions to allow access.

### Scenario 3: Unsupported Device Categories
- **Symptoms**: File tracing does not work for specific devices.
- **Resolution**: Verify that the device category is supported by the DLP server. If unsupported, escalate to the product team for feature enhancement requests.

## Escalation Guidelines

### When to Escalate
- The CAP driver fails to load despite a clean installation.
- File tracing issues persist across multiple supported device categories.
- The issue involves unsupported device types or requires a feature enhancement.

### How to Escalate
1. Collect all relevant logs, screenshots, and configuration files.
2. Document the troubleshooting steps already performed.
3. Submit a detailed escalation request to the development or product team, including all collected data and findings.
