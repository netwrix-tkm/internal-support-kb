# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Logs and Reporting Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview
This guide focuses on troubleshooting issues related to logs and reporting in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically for E-discovery (eD) and Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies. These logs are critical for understanding policy enforcement, identifying potential risks, and generating actionable reports. This document provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving issues in this category, ensuring support engineers can address customer concerns effectively.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **E-discovery (eD):** A feature that scans endpoints for sensitive data based on predefined policies. Logs generated by eD scans provide insights into detected data and policy compliance.
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** Monitors and controls the transfer of sensitive data based on content inspection. CAP logs detail policy enforcement actions, such as blocking or allowing data transfers.
- **Log Display Limits:** By default, the system displays a limited number of log records (e.g., 200). This can be adjusted to improve visibility for reporting purposes.

### System Context
- Logs are stored within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector interface and are accessible via the Reports & Analysis section.
- The system allows customization of log display settings to accommodate larger datasets for reporting needs.
- Proper log interpretation requires familiarity with policy configurations and the types of data being monitored.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Customers report difficulty accessing or interpreting logs for eD or CAP policies.
- Inability to generate comprehensive reports due to limited log visibility.
- Requests for guidance on increasing log display limits or exporting data.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Logs are critical for compliance audits or immediate risk assessments.
- **Medium Priority:** Logs are needed for routine reporting or internal reviews.
- **Low Priority:** General inquiries about log access or system capabilities.

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Understand the Customer’s Objective:**
   - Determine whether the issue involves accessing logs, interpreting data, or generating reports.
   - Identify the specific policies (e.g., eD or CAP) involved.

2. **Verify Log Accessibility:**
   - Confirm that the customer can navigate to the Reports & Analysis section.
   - Check if the logs for the relevant policies are being generated.

3. **Assess Display Limit Settings:**
   - Determine if the default log display limit is sufficient for the customer’s needs.
   - Guide the customer on increasing the display limit if necessary.

4. **Review Policy Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the policies are correctly configured to generate the expected logs.
   - Verify that the system is actively monitoring the endpoints in question.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask the Customer
- What specific policies (eD or CAP) are you trying to gather logs for?
- Are you encountering any errors when accessing the logs?
- How many records do you need to view or export for your reporting purposes?
- Have you adjusted the log display settings before?

### Data to Collect
- Screenshots of the Reports & Analysis section showing the issue.
- Details of the policies being monitored (e.g., policy names, configurations).
- Exported logs (if accessible) for further analysis.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Limited Log Visibility
- **Symptom:** Customer reports that only 200 log records are visible.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Guide the customer to the log display settings.
  2. Instruct them to increase the display limit to 5000 records.
  3. Verify that the logs are now visible and accessible for reporting.

### Scenario 2: Difficulty Interpreting Logs
- **Symptom:** Customer is unsure how to interpret the data in the logs.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Provide an overview of the log structure (e.g., columns, key fields).
  2. Share documentation or examples of how to analyze logs for specific use cases.
  3. Offer to review a sample log file with the customer to clarify any confusion.

### Scenario 3: Missing Logs
- **Symptom:** Logs for specific policies are not appearing in the Reports & Analysis section.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify that the policies are active and correctly configured.
  2. Check if the endpoints are connected and reporting data to the system.
  3. Escalate to engineering if the issue persists after verifying configurations.

## Detailed Case Studies
### Case Study: Ticket [500Qk00000E8QzlIAF](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000E8QzlIAF/view)
#### Initial Symptoms
The customer, ACI Worldwide US, reported difficulty gathering logs for their eD and CAP policies to create digestible reports.

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer could access the Reports & Analysis section.
2. Identified that the default log display limit (200 records) was insufficient for their reporting needs.
3. Guided the customer on increasing the display limit to 5000 records.

#### Key Information Leading to Resolution
- The customer was unfamiliar with the log display settings.
- Increasing the display limit resolved their visibility issue.

#### Resolution
Provided step-by-step instructions to adjust the log display settings. Verified that the customer could now access the required data for reporting.

#### Key Takeaways
- Customers may need guidance on system settings that impact log visibility.
- Proactively sharing documentation on log management can prevent similar issues.

#### Efficiency Improvements
- Include a quick reference guide for adjusting log display settings in the product documentation.
- Develop a training module for customers on log interpretation and reporting.

## Best Practices & Tips
- **Proactive Education:** Share documentation and training resources on log management with customers during onboarding.
- **Standardized Responses:** Create templates for common log-related inquiries to improve response times.
- **Regular Follow-Ups:** Check in with customers after resolving log issues to ensure they can generate the reports they need.
- **Internal Knowledge Sharing:** Maintain an internal repository of resolved cases to help engineers recognize patterns and apply proven solutions.

## Escalation Guidelines
- **When to Escalate:**
  - Logs are missing despite correct policy configurations and active endpoints.
  - System errors or performance issues prevent log access or export.
  - Customer requires advanced customization or integration for reporting.

- **How to Escalate:**
  1. Collect all relevant information, including screenshots, policy details, and exported logs.
  2. Document the troubleshooting steps already taken.
  3. Submit the case to the engineering team with a detailed summary of the issue and customer requirements.
