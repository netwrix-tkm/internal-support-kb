# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Active Directory Sync Errors in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview
Active Directory (AD) synchronization is a critical feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) that ensures seamless integration with directory services for user authentication, group management, and policy enforcement. Proper synchronization is essential for maintaining security, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO), and ensuring accurate user and group data. This guide provides a comprehensive reference for diagnosing and resolving AD Sync errors, equipping support engineers with the tools and methodologies needed to address these issues effectively.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Active Directory (AD):** A directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks, used for user authentication and authorization.
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):** A protocol used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an IP network.
- **FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name):** The complete domain name for a specific computer or host on the internet.
- **SSO (Single Sign-On):** A session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP):** A data loss prevention (DLP) solution that integrates with AD for user and group synchronization.
- **Synchronization Process:** EPP connects to AD via LDAP or Azure AD APIs to fetch user and group data. This requires correct configuration of connection settings, permissions, and network access.
- **Common Components:** AD Sync relies on network connectivity, correct port usage (e.g., 389 for LDAP), and accurate configuration of Organizational Units (OUs) and service accounts.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms of AD Sync Errors
- Failure to bind to the AD server.
- Users or groups not appearing in EPP after synchronization.
- Incorrect user types (e.g., EPP instead of AD users).
- Password synchronization issues.
- Errors such as "Invalid Credentials" or "Can't contact LDAP Server."
- Blank "Last Synchronization" field in the EPP console.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting admin logins or critical user authentication.
- **Medium Priority:** Errors impacting group synchronization or non-critical users.
- **Low Priority:** Cosmetic issues or minor discrepancies in user/group data.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Network Connectivity:**
   - Use `ping`, `telnet`, or `ssh` to confirm connectivity to the AD server.
   - Ensure required ports (e.g., 389 for LDAP) are open.

2. **Check Configuration Settings:**
   - Validate the FQDN or IP address of the AD server.
   - Confirm the correct port is being used.
   - Verify the Organizational Unit (OU) details.

3. **Review Logs:**
   - Examine system logs (`sync_aad.log`, `ldap.log`) for error messages.
   - Look for specific errors such as "Invalid Credentials" or "Can't contact LDAP Server."

4. **Test Authentication:**
   - Use test credentials to verify the connection.
   - Ensure the service account has the necessary permissions.

5. **Replicate the Issue:**
   - Attempt to reproduce the error in a controlled environment to isolate the root cause.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
- What error messages are being displayed?
- Has the AD configuration been recently modified?
- Are there any network changes (e.g., firewalls, VPNs, or VNETs)?
- What is the AD server's FQDN or IP address?
- Are there any screenshots or logs available?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- **System Logs:** `sync_aad.log`, `ldap.log`, and general system logs.
- **Configuration Details:** AD server address, port, OU, and service account credentials.
- **Network Information:** Firewall rules, VPN configurations, and connectivity tests.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Incorrect Port Usage or FQDN Resolution Issues
- **Symptoms:** Failure to bind to AD; errors in logs.
- **Solution:** Use port 389 for LDAP and connect via IP address instead of FQDN.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000EW8iMIAT](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000EW8iMIAT/view)]

### Scenario 2: Misconfigured Connection Settings
- **Symptoms:** "Invalid Credentials" error; failed authentication.
- **Solution:** Correct the User field (use username without domain) and update the AD Administrators Group with the correct group name.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000OJQYtIAP](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000OJQYtIAP/view)]

### Scenario 3: Expired Azure AD Client Secret
- **Symptoms:** Unable to update client secret; synchronization fails.
- **Solution:** Delete the existing synchronization configuration and recreate it with the new client secret.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000ItadCIAR](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000ItadCIAR/view)]

### Scenario 4: Deleted Azure AD Group Causing Sync Failure
- **Symptoms:** Blank "Last Synchronization" field; group membership not updated.
- **Solution:** Remove the deleted group from the EPP synchronization configuration.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000LaG5QIAV](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000LaG5QIAV/view)]
