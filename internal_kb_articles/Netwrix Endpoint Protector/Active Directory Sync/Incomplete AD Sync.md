# Knowledge Base Article: Troubleshooting Incomplete Active Directory Sync in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

The Active Directory (AD) Sync feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector enables seamless synchronization of users and groups from an organization's AD to the Endpoint Protector system. However, several issues may arise during the synchronization process, leading to incomplete or incorrect data transfer. This article provides a comprehensive guide to troubleshooting common AD sync issues, identifying root causes, and implementing tested solutions.

## Detailed Issues

### 1. Random User-Group Associations
**Symptoms:**  
- User-group associations appear random and incorrect after AD sync.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify the connection to the Domain Controller (DC).  
2. Check logs to confirm that groups and users are being created as expected.  
3. Randomly select users to verify their group memberships.  
4. Delete the existing AD connector and all users/groups in Endpoint Protector.  
5. Reconfigure the AD sync and verify the results.  

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was not definitively identified. The issue persisted despite multiple reconfigurations.  

**Solution:**  
- Ensure the AD sync configuration is thoroughly reviewed and validated during setup.  
- Monitor for updates or patches that may address synchronization issues.

### 2. Deleted Users Not Re-Imported
**Symptoms:**  
- Users deleted from the Endpoint Protector web interface are not re-imported during subsequent AD syncs.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify that user data is correctly transferred during the initial sync.  
2. Delete user data from the EPP web interface and re-initiate the AD sync.  
3. Check logs for errors during the sync process.  

**Root Cause:**  
Deleted users in the EPP were not being re-imported due to a failure in the synchronization process.  

**Solution:**  
- Recover the deleted users in the EPP to enable re-import during subsequent syncs.

### 3. Password Reset Issues for Synced Users
**Symptoms:**  
- Synced users are unable to reset passwords due to the absence of an "old password."  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Review password expiration settings on the appliance.  
2. Confirm that users synced from AD are being treated as local accounts.  
3. Suggest changing the password expiration setting to "never expire."  

**Root Cause:**  
The password expiration policy conflicted with the AD sync configuration, causing confusion for synced users.  

**Solution:**  
- Disable the "ignore AD authentication" setting to allow users to authenticate directly through AD.

### 4. Group Sync Issues with Content Aware Alerts
**Symptoms:**  
- Groups do not sync properly for Content Aware Alerts, and only a few users are selected.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify that users are correctly assigned to groups in AD.  
2. Test with local groups to confirm expected behavior.  
3. Investigate MySQL data for affected users.  

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by the same user logging in from multiple devices, leading to conflicts in group verification.  

**Solution:**  
- Inform the customer that device-switching behavior can affect group syncing.

### 5. Missing Super Admin User
**Symptoms:**  
- A specific user, part of a synced group, does not appear as a super admin.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Confirm the user's group membership in AD.  
2. Perform a manual sync to check if the user appears.  
3. Verify sync settings and test connections.  

**Root Cause:**  
Potential configuration issues in the AD sync settings prevented the user from being recognized as a super admin.  

**Solution:**  
- Ensure that sync settings are correctly configured to include all relevant users.

### 6. Incomplete Sync to Administrative Group
**Symptoms:**  
- Some users are not synchronized to the Administrative Group despite being correctly assigned in AD.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Confirm that the affected users are part of the same AD groups as those successfully imported.  
2. Check the backend of the Endpoint Protector server for deleted users.  
3. Restore deleted users and re-initiate the sync.  

**Root Cause:**  
Previously deleted users in the Endpoint Protector server were not re-imported during synchronization.  

**Solution:**  
- Restore deleted users from the backend and perform another synchronization.

## Best Practices

1. **Validate AD Sync Configuration:** Ensure that all settings are correctly configured during the initial setup.  
2. **Monitor Logs Regularly:** Regularly review logs to identify and address potential issues early.  
3. **Avoid Manual Deletions:** Avoid deleting users or groups directly from the Endpoint Protector web interface unless necessary.  
4. **Backup Before Changes:** Always create a backup or snapshot of the Endpoint Protector appliance before making significant changes.  
5. **Align Policies with AD Settings:** Ensure that local policies, such as password expiration, align with AD configurations to prevent conflicts.

## Advanced Topics

### Handling Device-Switching Conflicts
- When users frequently switch between devices, monitor their login behavior and verify group memberships based on the last seen timestamps.  
- Consider implementing session management policies to reduce conflicts.  

### Backend Restorations
- Use backend tools cautiously to restore deleted users or groups. Always ensure a backup is available before making changes.
