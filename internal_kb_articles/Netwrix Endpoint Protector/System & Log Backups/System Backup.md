# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: System Backup Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to the **System Backup** feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). System backups are critical for preserving configurations, settings, and user data, ensuring business continuity during migrations, upgrades, or disaster recovery. Understanding common issues and their resolutions is essential for maintaining system reliability and minimizing downtime.

---

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **System Backup V1**: The legacy backup feature, which is being deprecated in version 5.9.5.0. It includes configurations, settings, and user data but is prone to issues such as hanging at high completion percentages.
- **System Backup V2**: The recommended backup feature, designed for improved reliability and efficiency. It excludes logs and audits, which must be backed up separately using the Audit Log Backup feature.
- **Backup Retention**: Proper management of backup retention settings is crucial to avoid disk space issues.
- **Disk Space Management**: Insufficient disk space is a common root cause of backup failures and performance issues.

### Terminology
- **EPP Server**: The central server hosting the Endpoint Protector platform.
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management systems that receive logs from EPP.
- **SSL Certificates**: Used for secure communication between EPP clients and the server.

### System Context
- Backups are stored locally on the EPP server and can be exported for migration or disaster recovery.
- Compatibility between the backup version and the server version is mandatory for successful restoration.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- Backups stuck at specific completion percentages (e.g., 20%, 99%).
- Low disk space warnings or critical disk space errors.
- Backup processes restarting in a loop.
- Export functionality failing due to insufficient disk space.
- Migration or upgrade issues related to backup size or server compatibility.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Critical disk space issues, backups stuck for extended periods, or migration/upgrade failures.
- **Medium Priority**: Non-critical backup warnings or minor delays in backup completion.
- **Low Priority**: General inquiries about backup procedures or feature usage.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Backup Status**: Check the progress and logs for any errors or warnings.
2. **Assess Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient free space is available for the backup process.
3. **Check Server Configuration**: Verify SSL certificates, server version compatibility, and backup settings.
4. **Analyze Logs**: Review system logs for connectivity issues, file system errors, or other anomalies.
5. **Test Backup Alternatives**: If System Backup V1 fails, recommend System Backup V2 or VM snapshots.

### Decision Points
- If disk space is low, prioritize cleanup and log management.
- If backups are stuck, investigate logs and consider restarting the backup service.
- If migration fails, verify server version compatibility and adjust upload limits.

## Information Collection

### Customer Queries
- What is the current version of the EPP server?
- Are you using System Backup V1 or V2?
- What is the size of the database or backup file?
- Have there been any recent changes to the server (e.g., upgrades, IP changes)?
- Are there any disk space warnings or errors?

### Data to Collect
- System logs and backup logs.
- Screenshots of the backup status or error messages.
- Disk space usage reports.
- Details of the server environment (OS version, virtualization platform, etc.).
