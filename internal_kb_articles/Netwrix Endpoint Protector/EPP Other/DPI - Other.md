# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Troubleshooting Log Retrieval Issues in Content Aware Reports

## Overview
This guide focuses on troubleshooting issues related to log retrieval in the Content Aware Report feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. These issues typically involve limitations in the number of log entries displayed or the time range covered by the logs. Understanding and resolving these problems is critical for ensuring customers can access the data they need for compliance, auditing, and analysis.

## Technical Background
The Content Aware Report feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector provides detailed logs of endpoint activity. By default, the reporting interface displays a limited number of log entries (e.g., 10,000) to optimize performance. However, users can export larger datasets for extended time ranges using the "Export" feature. 

### Key Concepts
- **Log Entry Limitations**: The default interface limits the number of log entries displayed to improve performance.
- **Export Feature**: Allows users to bypass the display limit and retrieve larger datasets for custom time ranges.
- **Time Range Selection**: Users can specify the desired time range for log retrieval, but improper configuration may result in incomplete data.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Users report being unable to retrieve logs for a 24-48 hour period.
- Logs displayed in the interface are limited to 2-3 hours or a maximum of 10,000 entries.
- Attempts to use the "Export" feature fail to produce the desired results.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: If the issue impacts compliance or critical investigations.
- **Medium Priority**: If the issue is related to routine reporting needs without immediate urgency.

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Verify the Issue**: Confirm the customer's reported symptoms by reviewing screenshots or conducting a remote session.
2. **Check Time Range Configuration**: Ensure the customer has correctly configured the time range for log retrieval.
3. **Test the Export Feature**: Guide the customer through the export process to determine if the issue persists.
4. **Review System Settings**: Check for any default limitations or misconfigurations in the reporting feature.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask the Customer
- What time range are you trying to retrieve logs for?
- Are you using the "Export" feature, and if so, what steps are you following?
- Have you encountered any error messages or unexpected behavior?

### Data to Collect
- Screenshots of the reporting interface and export settings.
- Logs from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system.
- Details about the customer's environment, including platform version and configuration.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Log Display Limit Reached
- **Symptoms**: Logs are limited to 10,000 entries or a 2-3 hour time range.
- **Resolution**: Instruct the customer to use the "Export" feature to retrieve logs for the desired time range. Ensure they select the correct time range and export format.

### Scenario 2: Export Feature Misuse
- **Symptoms**: The customer reports that the export process does not work.
- **Resolution**: Guide the customer step-by-step through the export process. Verify that they are selecting the correct options and saving the file in the appropriate location.

### Scenario 3: Misconfigured Time Range
- **Symptoms**: Logs retrieved do not cover the desired 24-48 hour period.
- **Resolution**: Confirm that the customer has correctly configured the time range in the reporting interface. Adjust settings as needed.
