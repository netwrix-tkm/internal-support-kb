## Technical Background  

### Key Concepts  

- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP):** A data loss prevention (DLP) solution designed to protect sensitive data across endpoints.  
- **Components:** Includes Device Control, Content Aware Protection (CAP), and other features for managing endpoint security.  
- **Deployment Models:** EPP can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.  
- **Features:** Covers functionalities such as advanced scanning, SSL/TLS communication, policy enforcement, and integration with SIEM solutions.  
- **Air-Gapped Environments:** Systems isolated from external networks, requiring offline updates and patches.  
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A method for analyzing network traffic to enforce security policies.  

### Terminology  

- **CAP Policies:** Rules governing data transfers based on content type or destination.  
- **DPI Certificate:** A certificate required for Deep Packet Inspection to function correctly.  
- **Shadow Files:** Temporary files created during data transfers, often consuming disk space.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** An additional layer of security requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification.  
- **Log Forwarding:** The process of sending logs from Netwrix EPP to external systems for analysis and monitoring.  

### System Context  

- **Server-Client Architecture:** EPP operates with a central server managing policies and endpoints running client agents.  
- **Integration Points:** EPP integrates with Active Directory (AD), external storage, and third-party tools like SIEM systems.  
- **Common Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux, and virtualized environments (e.g., Hyper-V, AWS).

## Issue Recognition & Triage  

### Identifying Issues  

- **Symptoms:** Common symptoms include failed installations, connectivity issues, unresponsive consoles, policy misconfigurations, licensing discrepancies, and feature limitations.  
- **Customer Reports:** Look for keywords like "unable to connect," "policy not applied," "license issue," "logs not forwarded," or "password reset required."  
- **Error Messages:** Pay attention to specific error codes or messages, such as "hash mismatch," "certificate not trusted," or "cifs_mount failed."  

### Assessing Priority  

- **High Priority:** Issues causing service outages, data loss, or security vulnerabilities.  
- **Medium Priority:** Problems affecting specific features or a subset of endpoints.  
- **Low Priority:** General inquiries, feature requests, or minor inconveniences.

## Diagnostic Methodology  

### Systematic Approach  

1. **Initial Assessment:**  
   - Confirm the reported issue.  
   - Gather environment details (e.g., platform, version, deployment method).  

2. **Reproduce the Issue:**  
   - Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.  

3. **Log Analysis:**  
   - Review server and client logs for error messages or anomalies.  

4. **Configuration Review:**  
   - Check settings related to the reported issue (e.g., CAP policies, certificates, syslog configurations).  

5. **Testing:**  
   - Implement temporary changes to isolate the root cause (e.g., disabling specific policies, clearing logs).  

6. **Resolution Implementation:**  
   - Apply targeted fixes, such as hotfixes, configuration adjustments, or patches.  

7. **Escalation:**  
   - If unresolved, escalate to the appropriate team with detailed findings.

## Information Collection  

### Questions to Ask Customers  

- What is the specific issue or error message?  
- When did the issue first occur?  
- What changes were made to the environment before the issue started?  
- Are all endpoints affected, or only specific ones?  
- What troubleshooting steps have already been attempted?  

### Logs & Data to Collect  

- **Server Logs:** Located in `/var/log/endpointprotector/`.  
- **Client Logs:** Accessible via the EPP client interface or installation directory.  
- **Configuration Files:** For policy-related issues.  
- **Screenshots:** For UI-related issues or error messages.  
- **Network Traffic Captures:** For connectivity or DPI-related issues.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions  

### Scenario 1: Licensing Discrepancies  

**Symptoms:** License count mismatch; alerts for low licenses.  
**Resolution:**  
1. Increase the maximum records displayed in the console.  
2. Enable automatic license release.  

---

### Scenario 2: DPI Certificate Not Trusted  

**Symptoms:** Web pages or applications blocked; certificate errors.  
**Resolution:**  
1. Reimport the DPI certificate.  
2. Mark the certificate as trusted in the macOS keychain.  

---

### Scenario 3: Policy Misconfiguration  

**Symptoms:** CAP policies fail to block sensitive data or enforce rules.  
**Resolution:**  
1. Adjust Global Threshold settings.  
2. Enable content rule detection.  
3. Test with sample files.  

---

### Scenario 4: Log Forwarding Issues  

**Symptoms:** Logs not being sent to the SIEM server.  
**Resolution:**  
1. Verify syslog configurations.  
2. Review appliance logs for discrepancies.  
3. Consult engineering for adjustments to syslog settings.  

---

### Scenario 5: Password Access Issues  

**Symptoms:** Unable to log in after a password change due to password manager sync failure.  
**Resolution:**  
1. Verify account status.  
2. Perform a password reset via the server backend.  
3. Advise the customer to manually record passwords or ensure password manager functionality.
