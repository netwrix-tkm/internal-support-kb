# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Offline Temporary Password (OTP) Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
The Offline Temporary Password (OTP) feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) is a critical component for granting temporary access to devices or enforcing Controlled Access Policies (CAP) in offline scenarios. This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting OTP-related issues, ensuring consistent and effective resolution. It covers common problems, diagnostic methodologies, and best practices to maintain OTP functionality.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Offline Temporary Password (OTP):** A time-sensitive, one-time-use code generated by the EPP server to grant temporary access to devices or enforce CAP policies when the endpoint is offline.
- **Controlled Access Policies (CAP):** Policies that restrict or allow access to devices based on predefined rules.
- **Server-Client Synchronization:** OTP functionality relies on synchronized server and client configurations, including time settings and certificate compatibility.

### System Context
- **Server Role:** Generates OTPs and validates their usage.
- **Client Role:** Accepts OTPs to unlock devices or enforce CAP policies.
- **Dependencies:** OTP functionality depends on accurate server time, certificate compatibility, and proper client-server communication.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms of OTP Issues
- OTPs fail to unlock devices or enforce CAP policies.
- Error messages such as "Invalid unlock code" or "Ung√ºltiger Freischaltcode."
- OTP request forms display incorrect or incomplete device lists.
- OTPs expire prematurely or are invalid upon entry.

### Categorizing Issues
1. **Functional Failures:** OTPs cannot be generated or validated.
2. **Behavioral Anomalies:** Unexpected system behavior, such as missing devices in OTP request forms.
3. **Configuration Errors:** Issues stemming from server-client mismatches or time synchronization problems.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** OTP functionality is entirely unavailable, affecting multiple users.
- **Medium Priority:** Intermittent OTP failures or isolated user reports.
- **Low Priority:** Non-critical inquiries, such as customization requests.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Environment Details:**
   - Confirm server and client versions.
   - Check recent updates or patches.
2. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Attempt to generate and use OTPs in a controlled environment.
3. **Review Logs:**
   - Analyze server and client logs for error messages or anomalies.
4. **Check Dependencies:**
   - Verify server time synchronization.
   - Ensure certificate compatibility.
5. **Isolate Variables:**
   - Test with different devices, users, or configurations to identify patterns.

### Decision Points
- **If the issue is reproducible:** Proceed with targeted troubleshooting.
- **If the issue is not reproducible:** Monitor for recurrence and gather additional data.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
1. What is the server and client version in use?
2. When did the issue first occur, and were there any recent updates or changes?
3. Are all users affected, or is the issue isolated to specific devices/users?
4. What error messages are displayed, if any?
5. Has the server time been checked for accuracy?

### Logs to Collect
- **Server Logs:** For OTP generation and validation errors.
- **Client Logs:** For OTP usage and CAP policy enforcement.
- **System Logs:** To identify time synchronization or certificate issues.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: OTPs Not Functioning After Power Outage
- **Root Cause:** Server time out of sync.
- **Solution:** Re-sync server time. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000C4s4XIAR)

### Scenario 2: OTP Request Form Displays "Universal" Instead of Devices
- **Root Cause:** Isolated customer environment issue.
- **Solution:** Monitor for recurrence; no systemic problem identified. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000DMfwHIAT)

### Scenario 3: CAP Policies Not Loading After OTP Entry
- **Root Cause:** Designed behavior when CAP OTP is active.
- **Solution:** Clarify expected behavior to the customer. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000EgQJ0IAN)

### Scenario 4: OTPs Fail After Client Update
- **Root Cause:** Compatibility issue with OpenSSL3.
- **Solution:** Apply offline patch to restore functionality. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Jhca9IAB)

### Scenario 5: OTP Validity Misunderstanding
- **Root Cause:** Misinterpretation of OTP expiration rules.
- **Solution:** Educate customers on OTP validity starting from generation time. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000MsyU2IAJ)
