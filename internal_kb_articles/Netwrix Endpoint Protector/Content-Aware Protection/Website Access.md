# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Content-Aware Protection - Website Access Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

The Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector is designed to monitor and control access to websites and web-based applications. It ensures compliance with organizational policies by blocking or allowing specific URLs, domains, or categories. However, misconfigurations, outdated software versions, or environmental factors can lead to issues such as blocked websites, unlogged access attempts, or performance degradation.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of common issues, troubleshooting steps, root causes, and tested solutions for resolving problems related to website access in the Content-Aware Protection feature.

## Detailed Issues

### VPN Blocks Specific URLs
**Symptoms:**  
- URLs inaccessible when connected to VPN.  
- Disabling CAP policies restores access.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify if URLs are blocked in the CAP dashboard.  
2. Disable IPv6 on the Linux system:  
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```
3. Test URLs in incognito mode on Chrome/Firefox.  
4. Whitelist URLs in "Denylists and Allowlists" > "Allowlists" > "Deep Packet Inspection".  
5. Update VPN routing rules:  
   ```plaintext
   ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 127.0.0.0/8
   ```

**Root Cause:**  
Cisco AnyConnect VPN routing rules interfered with URL access.

**Solution:**  
Update VPN routing rules and whitelist URLs in CAP.

### Unwanted Website Access Not Logged
**Symptoms:**  
- Access to unwanted websites without logs.  

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify if the URL is in the denylist.  
2. Check if the denylist is selected in the CAP policy.  
3. Ensure DPI is enabled.

**Root Cause:**  
URL was not in the denylist, and the denylist was not applied in the CAP policy.

**Solution:**  
Add the URL to the denylist and enable the CAP policy.

**Source Ticket:** [Unwanted website access not logged](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000BmizhIAB/view)

### HTTPS Certificate Change Blocks Login
**Symptoms:**  
- Login to government website fails due to certificate issues.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify HTTPS certificate changes on the website.  
2. Check DPI settings and mTLS errors.  
3. Review logs for certificate validation errors.

**Root Cause:**  
DPI settings did not recognize the new HTTPS certificate.

**Solution:**  
Allow mTLS errors in DPI bypass settings.

**Source Ticket:** [HTTPS certificate change blocks login](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000F7lxeIAB/view)

### AWS Content Fails to Load
**Symptoms:**  
- AWS website loads partially, with errors in certain sections.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Add `amazonaws.com` to the allowlist.  
2. Test with updated client versions.  
3. Collect logs and analyze for false positives.

**Root Cause:**  
Content filtering flagged AWS content as false positives.

**Solution:**  
Update allowlist and upgrade to the latest client version.

**Source Ticket:** [AWS content fails to load](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000OyL3lIAF/view)

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates:** Ensure all clients and servers are running the latest version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector to avoid compatibility issues.  
2. **Policy Testing:** Test CAP policies in a controlled environment before deploying them organization-wide.  
3. **Allowlist Management:** Regularly review and update allowlists for critical services and websites.  
4. **DPI Monitoring:** Enable logging for DPI to track blocked or allowed traffic effectively.  
5. **Certificate Monitoring:** Monitor HTTPS certificate changes for critical websites to preemptively address potential issues.  
6. **Client Rollouts:** Perform phased rollouts for client upgrades to identify and resolve issues early.

## Advanced Topics

### Handling False Positives in Content Filtering
- Use detailed logs to identify patterns in false positives.  
- Adjust CAP policies to exclude specific file types or domains causing issues.  
- Test with updated builds to address known bugs.

### Debugging DPI Issues
- Enable verbose logging for DPI to capture detailed traffic analysis.  
- Use network monitoring tools to identify blocked packets and their sources.
