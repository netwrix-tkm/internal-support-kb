# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting DPI Blocking URL Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

The **DPI Blocking URL** feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) is a critical component of the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) module. It enables organizations to monitor and control web traffic by blocking or allowing specific URLs and domains. This feature is essential for enforcing data security policies, preventing unauthorized data transfers, and ensuring compliance with organizational standards.

Understanding and troubleshooting issues related to DPI Blocking URL is vital for maintaining uninterrupted access to legitimate resources while ensuring that security policies are effectively enforced. This guide provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving common problems encountered with this feature.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A method of analyzing network traffic at the packet level to enforce policies such as URL blocking or allowlisting.
- **CAP Policies:** Content-Aware Protection policies define actions (e.g., block, report) for specific data types, URLs, or domains.
- **Denylist/Allowlist:** Lists of URLs or domains explicitly blocked or allowed by the DPI feature.
- **Stealthy DPI Driver:** A driver that enables DPI functionality on endpoints, ensuring traffic inspection without user disruption.
- **Intercept VPN:** A feature that routes traffic through a virtual network for inspection, which can impact local network access.

### System Context
- DPI Blocking URL operates independently of other CAP policies, meaning global denylist/allowlist settings override individual policy configurations.
- Compatibility with operating systems, browsers, and third-party tools (e.g., MDM solutions like Jamf) is critical for proper functionality.
- SSL inspection by antivirus or other tools can interfere with DPI operations, requiring careful configuration.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms of DPI Blocking URL Issues
- Websites or applications are blocked unexpectedly.
- Allowlisted URLs remain inaccessible.
- Certificate errors occur on Mac devices.
- Specific user groups experience inconsistent behavior.
- Uploads or downloads are delayed or fail without logs.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting critical business operations (e.g., inability to access internal systems or upload files).
- **Medium Priority:** Problems impacting specific users or non-critical applications.
- **Low Priority:** Display issues or minor inconveniences that do not disrupt functionality.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify the Environment:**
   - Confirm the operating system, EPP client version, and CAP policy configurations.
   - Check if the Stealthy DPI driver and required certificates are installed and configured.

2. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Attempt to replicate the problem on the affected system.
   - Test with different browsers, devices, or network configurations.

3. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Collect logs from the EPP client, including SSLsplit logs and DPI logs.
   - Enable debug mode if necessary to capture detailed information.

4. **Check Policy Configurations:**
   - Review denylist/allowlist entries for accuracy.
   - Ensure CAP policies are correctly applied to the affected users or devices.

5. **Test Resolutions:**
   - Temporarily disable DPI or modify policies to isolate the root cause.
   - Apply test builds or patches if provided by the development team.

## Information Collection

### Key Questions to Ask Customers
- What specific websites or applications are affected?
- Are all users impacted, or only specific groups/devices?
- Was any recent update applied to the operating system, EPP client, or policies?
- Are there any third-party tools (e.g., antivirus, MDM) in use that could interfere with DPI?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- EPP client logs (including debug logs if enabled).
- SSLsplit logs for traffic inspection details.
- Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue.
- Output of network configuration commands (e.g., `ipconfig /all`).
- Policy configurations and applied settings.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Websites Blocked After OS Update
- **Symptoms:** Websites are inaccessible after updating macOS or Windows.
- **Root Cause:** Compatibility issues between the EPP client and the updated OS.
- **Solution:** Revert to a previous EPP client version or apply a test build. Monitor for compatibility updates in future releases.

### Scenario 2: Allowlisted URLs Still Blocked
- **Symptoms:** URLs added to the allowlist remain inaccessible.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration in the allowlist or caching issues.
- **Solution:** Re-add the URL to the allowlist, clear browser cache, and verify DPI settings.

### Scenario 3: Certificate Errors on Mac Devices
- **Symptoms:** Users encounter certificate errors when accessing websites.
- **Root Cause:** Missing or improperly configured certificates in the macOS keychain.
- **Solution:** Push the required certificate via MDM (e.g., Jamf) and set trust to "allow all."

### Scenario 4: DPI Blocking Uploads or Downloads
- **Symptoms:** File transfers fail or are delayed.
- **Root Cause:** DPI settings inadvertently block specific file types or URLs.
- **Solution:** Adjust DPI policies to allow the required file types or destinations.

### Scenario 5: Localhost Access Blocked by Intercept VPN
- **Symptoms:** Localhost resources are inaccessible when Intercept VPN is enabled.
- **Root Cause:** VPN configuration restricts local network access.
- **Solution:** Disable Intercept VPN or adjust its settings to allow localhost traffic.
