## Detailed Issues

### Missing Shadowing Logs
**Symptoms:** Unable to generate reports for client printing activities; shadowing logs not generated.  
**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify that File Shadowing is enabled under **Device Control > Computer Settings**.  
2. Recommend configuring an external file shadow repository instead of using the default internal repository.  
3. Test the settings on the development server.  
4. Schedule a remote session for further investigation if initial steps fail.  

**Root Cause:** Policy settings may be overly restrictive, preventing shadowing logs from being generated.  
**Solution:** Adjust policy settings to be less restrictive. Consider using an external repository for better performance.

### Printing Blocked in Outlook After Update
**Symptoms:** Print jobs blocked with "Content Threat Blocked" event in the console.  
**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify the issue by attempting to print from Outlook.  
2. Check CAP policy logs for blocked processes.  
3. Investigate new functionality introduced in the latest client version.  

**Root Cause:** New functionality in the updated client version monitors and blocks printing from Outlook due to existing CAP policies.  
**Solution:** Add "Outlook" to **System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions** to prevent monitoring and blocking during printing.

### CAP Policies Set to "Report Only" Still Blocking Printing
**Symptoms:** Print jobs blocked despite CAP policies set to "Report only."  
**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Verify CAP policy settings and logs.  
2. Attempt to reproduce the issue by printing from Outlook.  

**Root Cause:** CAP settings inadvertently blocked print actions due to scanning exceptions not being configured.  
**Solution:** Add "Outlook" to Advanced printers MTP scanning exceptions.  
**Source Ticket:** [CAP Report Only Issue](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000E7XC6IAN/view)

### Misconfigured "Browser Printing" Policy
**Symptoms:** Printing blocked due to confusion over policy configuration.  
**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Review existing policies for misconfigurations.  
2. Investigate residual policies from previous configurations.  

**Root Cause:** Misconfiguration or outdated policies interfering with printing functionality.  
**Solution:** Correctly configure policies and remove outdated or conflicting ones.

### Isolated User Printing Issue
**Symptoms:** One user unable to print from Outlook; other users unaffected.  
**Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1. Review CAP logs for blocked processes.  
2. Verify that no specific policies are causing the issue.  

**Root Cause:** "Browser Policy" inadvertently blocking printing for the user.  
**Solution:** Add "Outlook" to Advanced Scanning Exceptions.

## Best Practices
- **Policy Configuration:** Regularly review and clean up outdated policies to prevent conflicts.  
- **External Repositories:** Use external file shadow repositories for larger groups of computers to improve performance.  
- **Advanced Scanning Exceptions:** Add commonly used applications like Outlook to exceptions to prevent unnecessary blocking.  
- **Feature Activation:** Ensure features like "Advanced printing and MTP scanning" are enabled for CAP policies to function correctly.  
- **Browser Extensions:** Install CAP browser extensions for Chrome and Edge to enable print blocking from browsers.  
- **Compatibility Checks:** Keep applications like Outlook updated to ensure compatibility with CAP settings.
