# Netwrix Endpoint Protector Knowledge Base Reference Guide  
## Content-Aware Protection (CAP) Printing  

### **Overview**  
Content-Aware Protection (CAP) Printing is a critical feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector designed to monitor, block, or report sensitive data being printed from endpoints. This functionality is essential for organizations aiming to enforce data security policies and prevent data leakage through printed materials. Understanding CAP Printing issues is vital for ensuring seamless operation and compliance with organizational policies.  

### **Technical Background**  
CAP Printing operates by analyzing print jobs based on predefined policies. These policies can block, report, or allow printing based on the content being printed. Key components include:  
- **File Shadowing**: Captures copies of printed files for auditing purposes.  
- **Advanced Scanning Exceptions**: Allows specific processes or applications to bypass CAP scanning.  
- **Browser Extensions**: Enables CAP functionality for print jobs initiated from web browsers.  
- **OCR Scanning**: Detects sensitive content in images attached to emails or printed documents.  

CAP Printing policies are configured in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console and rely on proper system settings, including the "Advanced printing and MTP scanning" feature.  

### **Issue Recognition & Triage**  
#### **Symptoms**  
- Print jobs blocked unexpectedly.  
- Delays or performance issues during printing.  
- Missing shadowing logs for printed files.  
- Compatibility issues with specific applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook).  
- Policies not triggering as expected.  

#### **Priority Assessment**  
- **High Priority**: Printing of sensitive data is blocked or not reported correctly.  
- **Medium Priority**: Performance issues or delays affecting user productivity.  
- **Low Priority**: Minor configuration discrepancies or non-critical functionality gaps.  

### **Diagnostic Methodology**  
1. **Verify Policy Settings**: Ensure CAP policies are correctly configured in the console.  
2. **Check System Features**: Confirm that "Advanced printing and MTP scanning" is enabled.  
3. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.  
4. **Review Logs**: Analyze CAP logs for blocked events or errors.  
5. **Test Exceptions**: Add processes or applications to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list to isolate the issue.  
6. **Check Compatibility**: Verify compatibility between CAP and the affected application or environment.  

### **Information Collection**  
#### **Customer Questions**  
- What application or process is being used for printing?  
- Are specific policies blocking the print jobs?  
- Has the system been updated recently?  
- Are there any performance issues or delays?  

#### **Logs/Data to Collect**  
- CAP logs from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console.  
- Shadowing logs (if enabled).  
- System configuration details (e.g., enabled features, policy settings).  
- Application version details (e.g., Outlook version).  

### **Common Scenarios & Solutions**  
#### **Scenario 1: Missing Shadowing Logs**  
**Symptoms**: Shadowing logs not generated despite correct policy settings.  
**Solution**:  
- Confirm File Shadowing is enabled.  
- Recommend using an external file shadow repository for better performance.  

#### **Scenario 2: Printing Blocked in Outlook**  
**Symptoms**: Print jobs blocked for Outlook emails, while other applications work fine.  
**Solution**:  
- Add "Outlook" to Advanced Scanning Exceptions.  
- Verify CAP policy settings for Outlook-specific rules.  

#### **Scenario 3: Browser Printing Not Blocked**  
**Symptoms**: Print jobs from browsers bypass CAP policies.  
**Solution**:  
- Install and configure the CAP browser extension for Chrome or Edge.  
- Confirm browser compatibility with CAP features.  

#### **Scenario 4: Policies Not Triggering**  
**Symptoms**: CAP print policies fail to report or block sensitive data.  
**Solution**:  
- Enable "Advanced printing and MTP scanning" in Global Settings.  
- Restart the endpoint to apply changes.  

#### **Scenario 5: OCR Scanning Performance Issues**  
**Symptoms**: OCR scanning delays or causes Outlook to become unresponsive.  
**Solution**:  
- Add "Outlook" to Advanced Scanning Exceptions.  
- Test OCR functionality without the Outlook Add-in.
