# Comprehensive Knowledge Base Guide: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a critical feature of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) platform, enabling advanced Content-Aware Protection (CAP) by analyzing network traffic for sensitive data and enforcing security policies. This guide provides a systematic approach to understanding, diagnosing, and resolving DPI-related issues. It is designed to equip support engineers with the tools and knowledge to handle DPI-related cases effectively and consistently.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A network traffic analysis method that inspects data packets for content, enabling enforcement of security policies such as blocking sensitive data uploads or monitoring specific traffic types.
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** A feature of EPP that uses DPI to enforce data loss prevention (DLP) policies.
- **DPI Bypass:** A mechanism to exclude specific traffic from DPI processing, often used for trusted applications or domains.
- **Peer Certificate Validation:** A DPI configuration setting that validates SSL/TLS certificates during traffic inspection.
- **Stealthy DPI:** A DPI mode designed to minimize interference with network traffic, often used to resolve compatibility issues with specific applications.

### System Context
- DPI operates at the network layer, intercepting and analyzing traffic before it reaches its destination.
- DPI relies on certificates for SSL/TLS traffic decryption. Proper certificate deployment is essential for functionality.
- DPI interacts with various components, including browsers, VPNs, and third-party security tools, which can introduce compatibility challenges.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- **Traffic Blocking:** Users unable to access specific websites or applications.
- **Performance Issues:** High CPU usage, slow network speeds, or application delays.
- **Certificate Errors:** Warnings or failures related to SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Features like CAPTCHA not loading, or DPI bypass logs appearing unexpectedly.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Issues causing widespread service disruption (e.g., inability to access critical applications or websites).
- **Medium Priority:** Performance degradation or intermittent issues affecting productivity.
- **Low Priority:** Informational inquiries or minor configuration adjustments.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Step 1: Verify DPI Configuration
- Confirm that DPI is enabled in the relevant policies (global, group, or user settings).
- Check Peer Certificate Validation settings (e.g., "Ignore Trust," "Bypass Invalid Peer Certificates").
- Review DPI Bypass lists for relevant domains or applications.

### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue
- Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.
- Use test websites or applications to confirm DPI behavior (e.g., [dlptest.com](https://dlptest.com)).

### Step 3: Collect Logs and Data
- Gather logs from the EPP client (`eppsplit.log`, `eppagent.log`) and server.
- Request screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue.
- Collect configuration details (e.g., DPI settings, allowlists, bypass lists).

### Step 4: Analyze Logs and Configuration
- Look for errors or warnings related to DPI processing (e.g., "Cannot extract the orig ip and port").
- Check for conflicts with third-party tools (e.g., VPNs, firewalls, antivirus software).

### Step 5: Test Solutions
- Apply configuration changes (e.g., enable Stealthy DPI, adjust bypass lists).
- Deploy test builds if available.
- Validate the resolution with the customer.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
1. What specific issue are you experiencing (e.g., blocked traffic, performance issues)?
2. Which applications or websites are affected?
3. Are you using any third-party tools (e.g., VPNs, firewalls)?
4. Have there been any recent changes to your environment (e.g., updates, new policies)?
5. Can you provide logs, screenshots, or videos demonstrating the issue?

### Logs to Collect
- **Client Logs:** `eppsplit.log`, `eppagent.log`
- **Server Logs:** CAP and DPI-related logs
- **Browser Logs:** Developer Tools > Network tab (for traffic analysis)
- **Third-Party Logs:** VPN or firewall logs (if applicable)

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: DPI Blocking Traffic
- **Symptoms:** Users unable to access specific websites or applications.
- **Solution:** Add the affected domain or application to the DPI Bypass list and update policies. Example: [Case 500Qk00000C1d0SIAR](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000C1d0SIAR/view).

### Scenario 2: High CPU Usage
- **Symptoms:** EPP client consuming excessive CPU resources during routine operations.
- **Solution:** Adjust CAP policies to exclude specific applications or file paths. Example: [Case 500Qk00000LbGbFIAV](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000LbGbFIAV/view).

### Scenario 3: Certificate Validation Errors
- **Symptoms:** Users unable to access websites due to SSL/TLS certificate errors.
- **Solution:** Enable "Bypass Invalid Peer Certificates" or adjust Peer Certificate Validation settings. Example: [Case 500Qk00000Nrjg8IAB](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Nrjg8IAB/view).

### Scenario 4: DPI Not Functioning on macOS
- **Symptoms:** DPI not intercepting traffic despite being enabled.
- **Solution:** Verify certificate deployment and enable "Intercept VPN Traffic" if applicable. Example: [Case 500Qk00000OOh61IAD](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000OOh61IAD/view).
