# Comprehensive Knowledge Base Guide: Managing Allowlist/Denylist Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

This guide provides a unified reference for diagnosing, troubleshooting, and resolving issues related to the **Allowlist/Denylist** functionality within the **Content-Aware Protection (CAP)** module of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The Allowlist/Denylist feature is essential for enforcing data security policies, ensuring compliance, and preventing unauthorized data transfers. By consolidating best practices, diagnostic methodologies, and common scenarios, this guide equips support engineers with the tools and knowledge to address customer concerns effectively.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** A feature that monitors and controls data transfers based on predefined policies.
- **Allowlist:** A list of approved domains, file types, or applications exempt from CAP restrictions.
- **Denylist:** A list of prohibited domains, file types, or applications blocked by CAP policies.
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A mechanism used to analyze and enforce CAP policies at the network level.
- **Media Transfer Protocol (MTP):** A protocol used for transferring media files, which must be enabled for certain CAP policies to function correctly.

### System Context
- **EPP Server:** Centralized management server for CAP policies.
- **EPP Client:** Endpoint agent that enforces CAP policies on user devices.
- **DPI Settings:** Critical for URL/domain-based allowlist/denylist enforcement.
- **Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the EPP server and client versions are compatible to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Policy Configuration:** CAP policies are configured to apply specific rules to endpoints, including file type restrictions, domain controls, and application blocking.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- Policies not applying as expected (e.g., blocked domains still accessible, allowed domains blocked).
- False positives in CAP logs.
- Application or file type restrictions not enforced.
- Inconsistent behavior across endpoints or users.
- Excessive logs or performance notifications.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting critical business operations (e.g., inability to upload files to essential domains, blocking of internal communications).
- **Medium Priority:** Issues causing inconvenience but with workarounds available (e.g., false positives in logs).
- **Low Priority:** Feature requests or minor configuration questions.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Policy Configuration:**
   - Check the CAP policy settings for allowlist/denylist entries.
   - Ensure DPI is enabled for URL/domain-based policies.
   - Confirm that MTP scanning is enabled if required by the policy.
2. **Check for Version Compatibility:**
   - Verify that the EPP server and client versions are up to date.
   - Review release notes for known issues or fixes.
3. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Attempt to replicate the reported behavior in a controlled environment using test accounts or devices.
4. **Collect Logs:**
   - Gather CAP logs, DPI logs, and system diagnostics from affected endpoints.
5. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Look for patterns, errors, or misconfigurations in the logs.
6. **Test Adjustments:**
   - Make incremental changes to the policy or configuration and test the results.
7. **Validate the Fix:**
   - Confirm that the issue is resolved and policies are functioning as intended.

## Information Collection

### Key Questions for Customers
- What specific behavior or issue are you experiencing?
- Which applications, file types, or domains are affected?
- What version of the EPP server and client are you using?
- Are DPI and CAP policies enabled?
- Have there been any recent changes to the configuration?
- Are there any error messages or notifications?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- CAP logs from the EPP server.
- DPI logs from affected endpoints.
- Screenshots or recordings of policy configurations and the issue.
- Diagnostic logs from the EPP client (e.g., `eppclient.log`, `eppsslsplit.log`).
- Network traffic logs if DPI is involved.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Policies Not Applying Correctly
- **Symptoms:** Policies fail to block or allow specified domains or file types.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured allowlist/denylist entries or disabled DPI.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify that the allowlist/denylist entries are correctly formatted (e.g., avoid using "@" in email domains).
  2. Ensure DPI is enabled for URL/domain-based policies.
  3. Update to the latest EPP server and client versions.

### Scenario 2: False Positives in CAP Logs
- **Symptoms:** Allowed domains or file types are flagged as blocked.
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient allowlist entries or outdated software.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Add additional entries to the allowlist dictionary.
  2. Enable DPI settings like "Stealthy DPI Driver" and "Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection."
  3. Upgrade to the latest software version to address known bugs.

### Scenario 3: Application Blocking Not Working
- **Symptoms:** Applications like WhatsApp or Skype are not blocked despite being on the denylist.
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect denylist configuration or missing protocol settings.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Reconfigure the application denylist with correct parameters.
  2. Enable MTP scanning for file transfers in applications like WhatsApp.

### Scenario 4: URL-Specific Blocking Requests
- **Symptoms:** Customers request to block specific URL paths (e.g., `dropbox.com/login`) while allowing the domain.
- **Root Cause:** Product limitation (URL path-specific blocking not supported).
- **Resolution:** Inform the customer of the limitation and suggest submitting a feature request.

### Scenario 5: Internal Emails Flagged as External
- **Symptoms:** Internal emails flagged as external despite allowlist entries.
- **Root Cause:** Improper formatting of email domains in the allowlist.
- **Resolution:** Remove "@" from email domain entries in the allowlist.
