# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Content-Aware Protection with RegEx  
## Overview  
This guide focuses on troubleshooting and resolving issues related to the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) when using Regular Expressions (RegEx). CAP with RegEx is a critical feature for identifying and protecting sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), across various platforms. Understanding and addressing issues in this category is essential for maintaining data security and compliance with organizational policies.

## Technical Background  
### Key Concepts  
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** A feature in EPP that monitors and controls the transfer of sensitive data based on predefined rules.  
- **Regular Expressions (RegEx):** A pattern-matching syntax used to identify specific data types (e.g., Aadhaar numbers, PAN card details).  
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A method used by EPP to analyze data packets for sensitive content.  
- **DPI Certificate:** A browser certificate required for EPP to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic.  

### System Context  
- CAP with RegEx relies on dictionaries containing patterns to detect sensitive data.  
- Logs generated by EPP provide insights into blocked or allowed actions, including details about the matched RegEx patterns.  
- Encrypted communication platforms (e.g., WhatsApp Web) may limit EPP's ability to monitor traffic.  

## Issue Recognition & Triage  
### Symptoms  
- Missing or incomplete data in CAP reports (e.g., missing Regex dictionary names).  
- Failure to block sensitive data uploads on specific platforms (e.g., WhatsApp Web, Dropbox).  

### Priority Assessment  
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting compliance or exposing sensitive data.  
- **Medium Priority:** Reporting discrepancies that do not impact data protection.  

## Diagnostic Methodology  
1. **Verify Environment Details:** Confirm the EPP version, platform, and affected components.  
2. **Reproduce the Issue:** Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.  
3. **Analyze Logs:** Examine EPP logs for anomalies or missing data.  
4. **Test Configuration Changes:** Apply temporary fixes (e.g., blocking specific URLs, restarting browsers).  
5. **Engage Development Team:** Escalate if the issue appears to be a software defect.  

## Information Collection  
### Customer Questions  
- What platforms or applications are affected?  
- When was the issue first observed?  
- Have there been any recent updates or configuration changes?  

### Logs and Data to Collect  
- EPP logs from the affected endpoints.  
- Screenshots or exported reports showing the issue.  
- Browser configuration details (e.g., DPI certificate status).  

## Common Scenarios & Solutions  
### Scenario 1: Missing Regex Dictionary Names in Logs  
- **Symptoms:** Reports pulled from Splunk do not display Regex dictionary names.  
- **Root Cause:** Configuration issue in the EPP server logs.  
- **Resolution:** Update to the latest EPP version (e.g., 5941) to apply the fix.  
- **Reference Case:** [500Qk00000EPRRZIA5](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000EPRRZIA5/view).  

### Scenario 2: Failure to Block Sensitive Data Uploads  
- **Symptoms:** Sensitive data (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN) is not blocked on platforms like WhatsApp Web or Dropbox.  
- **Root Cause:**  
  - Encrypted communication on WhatsApp Web prevents monitoring.  
  - DPI certificate not applied to the browser session.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - Block `web.whatsapp.com` URL.  
  - Restart the browser to apply the DPI certificate for Dropbox.  
- **Reference Case:** [500Qk00000FoEITIA3](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000FoEITIA3/view).  

## Detailed Case Studies  
### Case Study 1: Missing Regex Dictionary Names in Logs  
- **Ticket ID:** [500Qk00000EPRRZIA5](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000EPRRZIA5/view)  
- **Initial Symptoms:** Regex dictionary names missing in Splunk reports.  
- **Diagnostic Steps:**  
  1. Verified the EPP version and logs.  
  2. Escalated to the development team for analysis.  
  3. Shared a test build with the customer for validation.  
- **Key Information:** Identified a configuration issue in the logs.  
- **Resolution:** Updated to version 5941, which included a fix.  
- **Takeaways:** Ensure customers are on the latest version to avoid similar issues.  

### Case Study 2: Failure to Block Sensitive Data Uploads  
- **Ticket ID:** [500Qk00000FoEITIA3](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000FoEITIA3/view)  
- **Initial Symptoms:** Aadhaar and PAN details not blocked on WhatsApp Web, email, and Dropbox.  
- **Diagnostic Steps:**  
  1. Attempted to block `web.whatsapp.com` URL.  
  2. Verified DPI certificate application for Dropbox.  
  3. Restarted the browser to apply changes.  
- **Key Information:** Encrypted communication on WhatsApp Web limits monitoring.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - Blocked the URL for WhatsApp Web.  
  - Restarted the browser to apply the DPI certificate for Dropbox.  
- **Takeaways:** Restarting the browser is critical for DPI certificate application.  

## Best Practices & Tips  
- **System Updates:** Encourage customers to keep EPP updated to the latest version.  
- **Browser Configuration:** Ensure DPI certificates are applied correctly by restarting browsers after installation.  
- **Encrypted Platforms:** Set realistic expectations for monitoring encrypted communication platforms.  
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Regularly review logs and reports for anomalies.  
- **Customer Communication:** Clearly explain limitations and provide actionable recommendations.  

## Escalation Guidelines  
- **When to Escalate:**  
  - Issues involving software defects or unresolvable configuration problems.  
  - High-priority cases affecting compliance or exposing sensitive data.  
- **How to Escalate:**  
  - Provide detailed logs, screenshots, and a clear problem description.  
  - Reference similar cases or known issues in JIRA for faster resolution.  
- **Escalation Path:**  
  - Tier 2 Support → Development Team → Product Management (if required).
