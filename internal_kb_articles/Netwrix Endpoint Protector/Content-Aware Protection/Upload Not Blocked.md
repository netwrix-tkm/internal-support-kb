# Comprehensive Knowledge Base Guide: Troubleshooting "Upload Not Blocked" Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving issues related to the "Upload Not Blocked" feature in the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) component of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. These issues typically involve file uploads bypassing configured CAP policies, leading to potential data leakage. Understanding and addressing these problems is critical for maintaining robust data loss prevention (DLP) measures and ensuring compliance with organizational security policies.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** A feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector that monitors and controls file transfers based on predefined policies. CAP can block, allow, or report file uploads based on file type, content, or destination.
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** A technology used to analyze data packets for enforcing CAP policies. DPI is essential for monitoring encrypted traffic.
- **Exit Points:** Applications or platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Slack) where file uploads are monitored and controlled.
- **File Hashing and Shadow Copies:** Mechanisms for identifying and logging file transfers, ensuring traceability and compliance.

### System Context
- **Server-Client Architecture:** CAP policies are configured on the Endpoint Protector server and enforced by the client installed on user devices.
- **Platform-Specific Behavior:** CAP functionality may vary across operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, Ubuntu) and application types (desktop vs. web).
- **Encryption Challenges:** End-to-end encryption in some applications (e.g., WhatsApp Web) can limit CAP's ability to inspect and block uploads.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- File uploads bypass CAP policies.
- Inconsistent blocking behavior across platforms or applications.
- Missing or incomplete logs for file transfers.
- CAP policies appear correctly configured but fail to enforce restrictions.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Sensitive data uploads bypass CAP policies, leading to potential data breaches.
- **Medium Priority:** Inconsistent blocking behavior causing operational inefficiencies.
- **Low Priority:** Reporting issues without immediate security risks.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Step 1: Verify Configuration
- Confirm CAP policies are correctly configured for the affected exit points.
- Check DPI and Stealthy DPI settings.
- Ensure the latest server and client versions are installed.

### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue
- Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.
- Test with different file types, sizes, and destinations.

### Step 3: Collect Logs
- Use the EPPSupportTool to gather logs from affected devices.
- Analyze logs for errors, bypass events, or misconfigurations.

### Step 4: Investigate Environmental Factors
- Check for VPNs, proxies, or third-party applications that may interfere with CAP functionality.
- Verify SSL certificate installation in browsers for web-based uploads.

### Step 5: Escalate if Necessary
- If the issue persists after initial troubleshooting, escalate to the development team with detailed logs and replication steps.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
1. What is the specific behavior observed (e.g., uploads bypassing, inconsistent blocking)?
2. Which applications or platforms are affected?
3. What operating systems and versions are in use?
4. Are there any recent changes to the environment (e.g., updates, new software)?
5. Are DPI and Stealthy DPI enabled?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- CAP policy configurations.
- Server and client versions.
- Logs from the EPPSupportTool.
- Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue.
- Network configurations (e.g., VPNs, proxies).

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: CAP Policy Misconfiguration
- **Symptoms:** Policies fail to block uploads; logs indicate incorrect settings.
- **Solution:** Review and adjust CAP policies to include all relevant exit points and file types. Ensure DPI is enabled.

### Scenario 2: Encryption Challenges
- **Symptoms:** Uploads bypass CAP policies on encrypted platforms (e.g., WhatsApp Web).
- **Solution:** Use a URL Denylist to block access to encrypted platforms.

### Scenario 3: DPI Malfunction
- **Symptoms:** DPI fails to inspect traffic, leading to unblocked uploads.
- **Solution:** Reconfigure DPI settings or reinstall the EPP client to restore functionality.

### Scenario 4: Application-Specific Issues
- **Symptoms:** CAP policies work on some platforms but not others (e.g., Microsoft Teams desktop vs. web).
- **Solution:** Update to the latest client version or apply specific workarounds (e.g., allowlist adjustments).

### Scenario 5: Licensing Problems
- **Symptoms:** CAP functionality stops working; license expiry alerts appear.
- **Solution:** Renew the license and import it via the Endpoint Protector web interface.

## Detailed Case Studies
