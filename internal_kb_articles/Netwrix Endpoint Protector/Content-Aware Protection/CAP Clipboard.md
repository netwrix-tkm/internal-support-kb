# Comprehensive Knowledge Base Guide: Troubleshooting CAP Clipboard Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to understanding, diagnosing, and resolving issues related to the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) Clipboard feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The CAP Clipboard feature is critical for enforcing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies by monitoring and restricting clipboard activities to prevent unauthorized data transfer. This document serves as a definitive reference for support engineers to handle CAP Clipboard-related issues effectively and consistently.

---

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Content-Aware Protection (CAP):** A feature that monitors and restricts data transfer based on predefined policies.
- **Clipboard Monitoring:** A CAP feature that tracks and enforces restrictions on copy-paste activities.
- **Exit Points:** Applications or destinations where data can be transferred (e.g., WhatsApp Desktop, SQL Management Studio).
- **Denylist:** A predefined list of sensitive data types (e.g., credit card numbers, source code) that are restricted from being copied or pasted.
- **Regex (Regular Expressions):** Used in CAP policies to identify patterns in clipboard content, such as sensitive data.

### System Context
- **Server and Client Versions:** Ensure compatibility between server and endpoint client versions.
- **Policy Configuration:** Policies must be correctly applied to users, groups, and devices to function as intended.
- **Platform-Specific Behavior:** Clipboard restrictions may behave differently across operating systems (e.g., macOS, Linux, Windows).

---

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Sensitive data can be copied and pasted despite restrictions.
- Clipboard restrictions block all activities, including internal ones.
- Policies fail to block specific data types (e.g., source code, SQL code).
- Clipboard restrictions are not enforced on certain platforms or applications.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** Issues affecting sensitive data transfer, especially during audits or POCs.
- **Medium Priority:** Misconfigurations causing inconvenience but not data breaches.
- **Low Priority:** Cosmetic or non-critical issues.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology

1. **Verify Policy Configuration:**
   - Check if the correct denylist is applied.
   - Confirm exit points and clipboard restrictions are enabled.
2. **Test Functionality:**
   - Attempt to replicate the issue using the same applications and data types.
   - Test across multiple platforms and endpoints.
3. **Review Logs:**
   - Analyze CAP logs for policy enforcement errors or conflicts.
4. **Check Client and Server Versions:**
   - Ensure compatibility and apply updates if necessary.
5. **Engage in Remote Sessions:**
   - Investigate the issue directly on the customerâ€™s environment if needed.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
- What specific data types are being blocked or allowed incorrectly?
- Which applications and platforms are affected?
- Are there any recent changes to the policy configuration or system updates?

### Data to Collect
- CAP policy configuration screenshots.
- Logs from the Endpoint Protector server and client.
- Video evidence of the issue, if possible.
- Details of the affected environment (OS, application versions, etc.).

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Sensitive Data Bypasses Clipboard Restrictions
- **Root Cause:** Clipboard content transferred as an image, bypassing text-based restrictions.
- **Solution:** Adjust policies to include image data restrictions. Forward logs to R&D for further investigation.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000BMifCIAT](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000BMifCIAT/view)]

### Scenario 2: Clipboard Restrictions Block All Activities
- **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration in CAP policies, restricting internal copy-paste activities.
- **Solution:** Adjust policies to differentiate between internal and external activities.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000DN5cIIAT](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000DN5cIIAT/view)]

### Scenario 3: Source Code Not Blocked by Clipboard Policies
- **Root Cause:** Policy not correctly applied to user groups or devices.
- **Solution:** Reconfigure policies and ensure proper application to intended users and devices.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000EyXCNIA3](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000EyXCNIA3/view)]

### Scenario 4: SQL Code Blocked Despite "Report Only" Policy
- **Root Cause:** Paste restrictions inadvertently enabled in CAP policy.
- **Solution:** Inform the customer that this behavior is expected and adjust settings if needed.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000JhYLHIA3](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000JhYLHIA3/view)]

### Scenario 5: Policy Not Applied to Specific Devices
- **Root Cause:** Policy not explicitly applied to the affected computer.
- **Solution:** Select the specific computer in the CAP policy to enforce restrictions.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000JjyjSIAR](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000JjyjSIAR/view)]

### Scenario 6: Clipboard Restrictions Fail on Linux Systems
- **Root Cause:** Flawed regex implementation in the initial build.
- **Solution:** Deploy updated build with corrected regex functionality.  
  [Example Case: [500Qk00000LgofRIAR](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000LgofRIAR/view)]
