# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Third-Party Conflicts in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (Content-Aware Protection)

## Overview
Third-party conflicts in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) often arise when the product interacts with external software, such as VPN clients or specialized applications. These conflicts can disrupt functionality, leading to issues like intermittent connectivity, application failures, or degraded performance. Understanding and resolving these conflicts is critical to maintaining seamless integration and ensuring customer satisfaction.

This guide provides a systematic approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving third-party conflicts, with a focus on Content-Aware Protection. It includes technical background, diagnostic methodologies, common scenarios, and real-world case studies to equip support engineers with the tools and knowledge needed to handle these issues effectively.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Content-Aware Protection**: A feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector that monitors and controls data transfers based on predefined policies.
- **Third-Party Conflicts**: Issues arising from interactions between the EPP client and external software, such as VPN clients or proprietary applications.
- **DPI (Data Protection Integration)**: A component of EPP that inspects data traffic for policy enforcement. DPI settings can sometimes interfere with third-party software.
- **Advanced Scanning Features**: Options like "Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning" that enhance data inspection but may cause compatibility issues.

### Common Third-Party Software Affected
- **Cisco Secure Client (AnyConnect VPN)**: Known for conflicts with DPI and advanced scanning features.
- **Proprietary Applications (e.g., MobileX)**: May experience connectivity issues due to DPI settings.

### Terminology
- **ISE Posture Indicator**: A status indicator in Cisco Secure Client that reflects compliance with security policies.
- **Stealth DPI Driver**: A DPI mode designed to improve compatibility with third-party applications.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Intermittent VPN disconnections or degraded performance.
- Application-specific connectivity failures.
- Browser pages failing to load after a VPN session starts.

### Categorization
- **High Priority**: Issues affecting critical business operations (e.g., VPN disconnections for a financial institution).
- **Medium Priority**: Issues impacting non-critical applications or isolated endpoints.
- **Low Priority**: Recurring but non-urgent issues reported by the customer.

### Initial Assessment
- Confirm whether the issue is isolated to a specific endpoint or affects multiple systems.
- Identify the third-party software involved and its version.
- Check for recent changes in the environment, such as software updates or policy modifications.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify the Problem**: Reproduce the issue to confirm its symptoms and scope.
2. **Review Logs**: Examine EPP and third-party software logs for error messages or conflicts.
3. **Isolate the Cause**: Disable specific EPP features (e.g., DPI or advanced scanning) to identify the conflicting component.
4. **Test Solutions**: Apply potential fixes incrementally and verify their impact.
5. **Document Findings**: Record all observations, steps taken, and results for future reference.

### Decision Points
- If disabling a specific feature resolves the issue, determine whether it can remain disabled without compromising security.
- If the issue persists, escalate to R&D with detailed logs and findings.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
- What are the symptoms of the issue, and when did they start?
- Has there been any recent change in the environment (e.g., software updates, new policies)?
- Is the issue isolated to specific endpoints or applications?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- EPP client logs.
- Third-party software logs (e.g., Cisco Secure Client logs).
- System event logs from affected endpoints.
- Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Cisco Secure Client VPN Disconnects
- **Symptoms**: VPN disconnects intermittently; browser pages fail to load.
- **Root Cause**: Conflict between EPP advanced scanning features and Cisco Secure Client.
- **Solution**:
  1. Disable "Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning" in EPP settings.
  2. Add the CiscoVPN process name to the advanced scanning exception list.
  3. Monitor performance to ensure stability.

### Scenario 2: Application-Specific Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms**: MobileX application cannot connect to its server.
- **Root Cause**: DPI settings in EPP interfering with the application.
- **Solution**:
  1. Enable the "Stealth DPI driver" for the affected endpoint.
  2. Test connectivity and confirm resolution.
