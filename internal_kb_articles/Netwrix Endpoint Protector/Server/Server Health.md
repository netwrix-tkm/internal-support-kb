## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP):** A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) platform designed to protect sensitive data across endpoints.
- **Endpoint Protector Appliance:** A virtual or physical server hosting the EPP software, responsible for managing device control, content-aware protection, and other security features.
- **Server Health:** Refers to the operational state of the server, including uptime, disk space, CPU usage, memory utilization, network connectivity, and service availability.
- **Hosted Environment:** EPP servers may be hosted locally or by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, CosoSys), requiring additional considerations for troubleshooting.

### Critical Components
- **Disk Space:** Insufficient disk space can lead to service interruptions, unresponsive interfaces, and data loss.
- **Database Integrity:** Corrupted or unoptimized databases can cause performance degradation and feature malfunctions.
- **Network Configuration:** Misconfigured network settings can prevent communication between the server and clients.
- **Logs and Backups:** Accumulated logs, shadow copies, and backups can consume disk space and impact server performance.

### Terminology
- **Audit Log Backup:** Archives logs to free up disk space.
- **Shadows:** Temporary files or backups stored on the server.
- **NTP (Network Time Protocol):** Synchronizes the server's clock with an external time source.
- **Partitions:** Logical divisions of disk space for efficient data management.
- **Health Checks:** Automated tests to verify server functionality and connectivity.
- **GRUB Menu:** A bootloader interface used for troubleshooting server startup issues.
- **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):** The complete domain name used to access the server.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- **Disk Space Warnings:** Alerts indicating low available disk space.
- **Unresponsive Interfaces:** Console or dashboard fails to load or becomes slow.
- **Service Failures:** Errors such as "500 Internal Server Error" or "ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT."
- **Backup Failures:** Audit log backups fail to complete or download.
- **Network Issues:** Server unable to connect to clients or external resources (e.g., NTP servers).
- **High Resource Usage:** CPU or memory spikes causing performance degradation.
- **Server Downtime:** Server webpage unreachable or health checks fail.
- **Configuration Errors:** Misconfigured nginx, SSL, or other server settings.

### Priority Assessment
- **Critical:** Server is down, inaccessible, or unable to perform core functions (e.g., logging, backups).
- **High:** Performance issues affecting multiple users or critical features.
- **Medium:** Non-critical features malfunctioning or warnings about potential issues.
- **Low:** Informational requests or minor inconveniences.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Symptoms:**
   - Confirm the reported issue (e.g., check disk space, logs, or server accessibility).
2. **Gather Context:**
   - Collect environment details (e.g., server version, platform, configuration).
3. **Check Hosting Environment:**
   - Identify whether the server is hosted locally or by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS, CosoSys).
4. **Review Logs:**
   - Examine server logs for errors or warnings related to the reported issue.
5. **Inspect Resources:**
   - Check disk space, memory, and CPU utilization for resource constraints.
6. **Restart Services:**
   - Attempt restarting server services to restore functionality.
7. **Apply Fixes:**
   - Implement targeted solutions based on the identified issue.
8. **Validate Resolution:**
   - Confirm that the issue is resolved and the server is functioning as expected.
9. **Document Findings:**
   - Record the issue, resolution steps, and any recommendations for future prevention.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
- What symptoms are you experiencing (e.g., error messages, slow performance)?
- When did the issue start, and were there any recent changes (e.g., updates, configuration changes)?
- What is the server's current version and environment (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, AWS)?
- Are there any specific actions that trigger the issue (e.g., accessing a dashboard, running backups)?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- **Disk Usage:** Output of `df -h` and `df -i` commands.
- **Service Status:** Logs from `/var/log/` (e.g., nginx, MySQL, PHP).
- **Database State:** MySQL queries for table sizes and partitions.
- **Network Configuration:** IP settings, gateway, and NTP synchronization status.
- **Error Messages:** Screenshots or text of any displayed errors.
- **Health Check Results:** Automated test results from hosting providers.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Low Disk Space
- **Symptoms:** Disk space warnings, unresponsive server, failed backups.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Clear unnecessary logs and backups (`rm /var/log/*.log`).
  2. Enable log rotation to prevent future accumulation.
  3. Reallocate disk space or expand partitions if necessary.

### Scenario 2: Unresponsive Console
- **Symptoms:** Console fails to load or displays "500 Internal Server Error."
- **Resolution:**
  1. Check disk space and clear logs if full.
  2. Restart services (`service nginx restart`, `service mysql restart`).
  3. Verify database integrity and repair if needed.

### Scenario 3: Backup Failures
- **Symptoms:** Audit log backups fail to complete or download.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Check disk space and clear shadows or temporary files.
  2. Verify SFTP connectivity for external backups.
  3. Reconfigure backup settings and test functionality.

### Scenario 4: Network Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms:** Server cannot connect to clients or external resources.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Verify network settings (IP, gateway, DNS).
  2. Check firewall rules and ensure required ports are open (e.g., UDP 123 for NTP).
  3. Restart network services or reconfigure adapters.

### Scenario 5: High CPU/Memory Usage
- **Symptoms:** Performance degradation during peak usage.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Identify and remove duplicate entries (e.g., devices, users).
  2. Optimize database partitions for better performance.
  3. Allocate additional resources (CPU, RAM) if necessary.

### Scenario 6: Configuration Errors
- **Symptoms:** Server inaccessible due to misconfigured nginx or SSL settings.
- **Resolution:**
  1. Reconfigure nginx or SSL settings and validate changes.
  2. Restart services to apply the updated configuration.
