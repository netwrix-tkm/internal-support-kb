## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **LiveUpdate Mechanism**: Automates the download and application of updates to the EPP server.
- **Checksum Verification**: Ensures the integrity of downloaded update files by comparing their hash values with expected values.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Limits the number of attempts to apply an update before skipping it.
- **Offline Patches**: Updates provided as downloadable files for environments with limited or no internet connectivity.
- **Backend Updates**: Updates applied to the server infrastructure, often requiring database or system-level changes.
- **Applied Updates List**: Displays successfully installed updates in the LiveUpdate interface.

### Common Terminology
- **Checksum Mismatch**: Indicates a discrepancy between the downloaded file's hash and the expected hash, often due to corruption or incomplete downloads.
- **Update Loop**: A scenario where an update continues to appear as available despite being successfully applied.
- **Air-Gapped Environment**: A network isolated from the internet, requiring manual patching methods.
- **Error Codes**:
  - **Error 5**: Checksum mismatch.
  - **Error 2**: Maximum retry limit reached.

### System Context
- **Server Versioning**: Updates are often tied to specific server versions. For example, certain hotfixes may only apply to version 5.9.3.0 or later.
- **Update Dependencies**: Some updates require prior patches or specific configurations to be applied successfully.
- **Environmental Factors**: Issues may arise due to network restrictions (e.g., firewalls), database errors, or insufficient disk space.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms of LiveUpdate Issues
- Updates fail to install or remain listed as available after installation.
- Error messages such as "Hash does not match" or "Maximum retries reached."
- Persistent update notifications despite successful application.
- Update process stalls at a specific percentage (e.g., 65% or 75%).
- Features or components (e.g., CAP policies) malfunction after updates.
- Backend updates fail due to connectivity or storage issues.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Security vulnerabilities (e.g., Remote Code Execution) or critical functionality disruptions.
- **Medium Priority**: Update loops or persistent notifications without immediate security risks.
- **Low Priority**: Cosmetic issues, such as display errors in the LiveUpdate interface.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Symptoms**: Confirm the issue reported by the customer (e.g., error messages, update status).
2. **Check Update Logs**: Review logs for errors or warnings during the update process.
3. **Validate Update Integrity**: Compare the hash of the downloaded update file with the expected value.
4. **Review Applied Updates**: Check the "View Applied Updates" section to confirm successful installations.
5. **Inspect Backend**: Review database entries (`syscommands`, `live_update`) and server configurations.
6. **Test Connectivity**: Ensure the server can reach update repositories (e.g., Ubuntu keyserver).
7. **Check Storage**: Verify sufficient disk space, especially in the boot partition.
8. **Retry Update**: Attempt to reapply the update or use an offline patch if applicable.

### Decision Points
- **Checksum Errors**: Re-download the update file and verify its integrity.
- **Update Loops**: Check for known bugs or display issues in the current server version.
- **Stalled Updates**: Investigate for erroneous patches or service interruptions.
- **Connectivity Issues**: Adjust firewall settings or network configurations.
- **Storage Problems**: Free up disk space and retry the update.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
- What error messages or symptoms are observed?
- What is the current server version and target update version?
- Are there any network restrictions (e.g., air-gapped environments)?
- Has the update been attempted multiple times? If so, what were the results?
- When was the last successful update applied?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- **Update Logs**: Found in the EPP Dashboard under LiveUpdate.
- **Database Entries**: Tables such as `syscommands` and `live_update`.
- **System Information**: Disk space, OS version, and network settings.
- **Error Screenshots**: Visual confirmation of issues.
- **Hash Values**: For downloaded update files.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Checksum Errors
- **Symptoms**: "Hash does not match" or "Error 5 - Checksum mismatch."
- **Resolution**:
  1. Re-download the update file from the official source.
  2. Verify the hash value against the expected value.
  3. Remove problematic patches from the `syscommands` and `live_update` tables if necessary.
  4. Reapply the update.

### Scenario 2: Update Loop
- **Symptoms**: Update remains listed as available despite being applied.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Confirm the update is listed under "View Applied Updates."
  2. Inform the customer that this is a known issue and will be resolved in a future version.
  3. Advise the customer to ignore the notification if the update is confirmed as applied.

### Scenario 3: Stalled Update Process
- **Symptoms**: Update stalls at a specific percentage (e.g., 75%).
- **Resolution**:
  1. Identify and remove any erroneous patches.
  2. Restart the update service or reboot the server.
  3. Reapply the update.

### Scenario 4: Backend Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms**: Backend updates fail due to network restrictions.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Test communication with the update repositories (e.g., Ubuntu keyserver).
  2. Adjust firewall settings to allow necessary traffic.
  3. Retry the update.

### Scenario 5: Storage Problems
- **Symptoms**: Updates fail due to insufficient disk space.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Clear space on the boot partition.
  2. Retry the update.

## Best Practices & Tips

1. **Verify File Integrity**: Always compare hash values of downloaded files with expected values to prevent installation errors.
2. **Pre-Update Validation**: Confirm update availability and system prerequisites before initiating updates.
3. **Monitor Update Logs**: Regularly review logs for errors or warnings during the update process.
4. **Database Maintenance**: Regularly check for conflicting or NULL entries in patch-related tables.
5. **Firewall Configuration**: Provide customers with guidelines for allowing update-related traffic.
6. **Disk Space Monitoring**: Ensure sufficient storage, especially in the boot partition.
7. **Offline Patch Readiness**: Maintain a repository of offline patches for quick access.
8. **Snapshot Creation**: Advise customers to create server snapshots before applying updates.
9. **Educate Customers**: Provide guidance on checking the "View Applied Updates" section to confirm successful installations.

## Escalation Guidelines

### When to Escalate
- Security vulnerabilities remain unresolved after applying updates.
- Persistent update loops or errors with no documented resolution.
- Issues affecting critical functionality (e.g., CAP policies, AD Sync).
- Backend errors requiring engineering intervention.

### How to Escalate
1. Collect all relevant logs, screenshots, and error messages.
2. Document the troubleshooting steps already performed.
3. Submit a detailed escalation request to the development team, including the ticket ID and customer impact.
4. Follow up with the customer regularly to provide updates.
