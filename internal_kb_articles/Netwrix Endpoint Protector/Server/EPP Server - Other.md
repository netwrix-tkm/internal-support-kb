## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP):** A DLP solution designed to protect sensitive data across endpoints by enforcing policies, monitoring activity, and managing device access.
- **Server Components:** Includes the EPP Appliance, backend services, database (MySQL/Redis), web services (Nginx), and integration points (e.g., Active Directory, SMTP, SIEM).
- **Features:** Device Control, Content Aware Protection (CAP), Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), logging, reporting, licensing, and external storage integration.
- **Deployment Environments:** EPP servers can be deployed on-premises, in virtualized environments (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, Proxmox), or in the cloud (e.g., AWS).

### Terminology
- **CAP Policy:** Content Aware Protection policies that monitor and control data transfers based on content.
- **DPI:** Deep Packet Inspection for analyzing and filtering network traffic.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates:** Used to secure server-client communication.
- **NTP:** Network Time Protocol for time synchronization.
- **Redis:** A database used for caching and log storage in EPP.
- **Smart Groups:** Dynamic grouping of endpoints based on naming conventions or rules.
- **Collector Code:** A unique identifier for server configurations.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- **Access Issues:** "500 Internal Server Error," inability to log in, or inaccessible web panels.
- **Configuration Errors:** Problems with SSL certificates, SMTP settings, or port configurations.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Slow server response, high resource usage, or disk space exhaustion.
- **Feature-Specific Failures:** Issues with CAP policies, logging, or reporting functionalities.
- **Connectivity Problems:** Failed communication between agents and the server.
- **Licensing Issues:** Expired licenses, unassigned licenses, or duplicate entries.

### Priority Assessment
- **Critical:** Server downtime, data loss, or security vulnerabilities.
- **High:** Feature malfunctions affecting multiple users (e.g., logging or reporting failures).
- **Medium:** Configuration issues with workarounds available (e.g., temporary login methods).
- **Low:** General inquiries or non-urgent configuration requests.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Gather details about the issue, including error messages, affected features, and environmental specifics.
   - Confirm the server version, deployment environment, and affected components.
2. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.
3. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Review server logs, client logs, and network configurations for anomalies.
4. **Verify Configuration:**
   - Inspect server settings, network configurations, and integration points (e.g., Active Directory, SSL certificates).
5. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Use tools like `ping`, `telnet`, or `curl` to verify server and agent communication.
6. **Apply Known Fixes:**
   - Implement potential solutions incrementally, verifying functionality after each step.
7. **Escalate if Necessary:**
   - Engage engineering or escalate based on predefined criteria.

## Information Collection

### Key Questions for Customers
- What is the exact error message or symptom?
- When did the issue start, and were there any recent changes (e.g., updates, migrations)?
- What is the deployment environment (e.g., VMware, AWS)?
- Are specific users, endpoints, or features affected?
- What troubleshooting steps have already been attempted?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- **Server Logs:** Located in `/var/log/` or accessible via the EPP UI.
- **Client Logs:** Use commands to collect logs from affected endpoints.
- **Configuration Files:** E.g., `sysctl.conf`, `nginx.conf`.
- **Screenshots:** For error messages or configuration settings.
- **Network Data:** Firewall logs, ping tests, and traceroutes.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Login Failures
- **Symptoms:** Admins unable to log in; MFA errors.
- **Resolution:**
  - Verify server time synchronization (NTP settings).
  - Reset admin passwords if necessary.
  - Remove conflicting local accounts.

### Scenario 2: SSL Certificate Issues
- **Symptoms:** Untrusted certificate errors; expired certificates.
- **Resolution:**
  - Ensure the full certificate chain (root and issuing CAs) is uploaded.
  - Replace certificates via the backend if UI upload fails.

### Scenario 3: Licensing Problems
- **Symptoms:** Expired licenses; licenses not applied.
- **Resolution:**
  - Upload the correct license file and release licenses from policies.
  - Contact the account manager for license replacements in catastrophic events.

### Scenario 4: Connectivity Issues
- **Symptoms:** Unable to access the EPP UI; DNS resolution failures.
- **Resolution:**
  - Verify DNS settings and upload SSL certificates.
  - Ensure at least two network adapters are configured for Hyper-V deployments.

### Scenario 5: CAP Policy Misconfigurations
- **Symptoms:** CAP/DPI policies blocking unintended actions.
- **Resolution:**
  - Adjust CAP policies to exclude specific users or applications.
  - Test policy changes on a small group before organization-wide deployment.

## Detailed Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Disk Space Exhaustion
- **Symptoms:** "500 Internal Server Error" due to MySQL service failure.
- **Diagnostic Steps:** Verified disk usage, backed up data, extended disk space, and reconfigured MySQL.
- **Resolution:** Cleared space, created a new partition, and updated configurations.
- **Key Takeaways:** Regularly monitor disk space and implement alerts for critical thresholds.

### Case Study 2: Active Directory Sync Failure
- **Symptoms:** AD structure not retrieved during synchronization.
- **Diagnostic Steps:** Verified LDAP connectivity, adjusted base search path.
- **Resolution:** Corrected the base search path to include the parent OU.
- **Key Takeaways:** Always confirm the base search path and LDAP user permissions.

### Case Study 3: CAP Policy Interference
- **Symptoms:** CAP policy not functioning due to third-party software.
- **Diagnostic Steps:** Tested with security software disabled, provided test builds.
- **Resolution:** Whitelisted EPP processes in Sophos and reconfigured policies.
- **Key Takeaways:** Check for third-party software interference early in the process.
