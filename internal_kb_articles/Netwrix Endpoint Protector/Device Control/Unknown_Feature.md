# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Device Control Issues in Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to the **Device Control** component in **Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)**. Device Control is a critical feature that ensures secure management of endpoint devices, preventing unauthorized access and data leakage. Understanding and resolving issues in this category is essential for maintaining system stability, ensuring compliance, and safeguarding sensitive data.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Device Control**: A feature within Netwrix Endpoint Protector that manages and restricts access to endpoint devices such as USB drives, external hard drives, and other peripherals.
- **File Shadows**: Temporary files created by the system to log or track data transfers for auditing purposes.
- **EPP Server**: The central server that manages endpoint policies, logs, and device control configurations.

### Terminology
- **CoSoSys Server**: The backend server powering Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: The process of ensuring sufficient storage is available for server operations.
- **Disconnection Events**: Situations where endpoints lose connectivity to the EPP server, often due to resource constraints.

### System Context
Device Control operates as part of the broader Endpoint Protector platform, relying on server resources (e.g., disk space, memory) to enforce policies and log activities. Issues in this component can disrupt endpoint connectivity, compromise security policies, or hinder administrative tasks.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Frequent disconnections from the EPP server.
- Requests for information about software versions or updates.
- Errors related to insufficient disk space or server resource exhaustion.

### Categorization
- **Informational Requests**: Customers seeking version details, features, or bug fixes.
- **Operational Issues**: Problems affecting server performance, such as disk space exhaustion.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues causing service disruptions (e.g., disconnections due to low disk space).
- **Medium Priority**: Requests for upgrade information or feature details.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Identify the Problem**: Review customer reports and logs to understand the issue.
2. **Verify the Environment**: Check server configurations, disk space, and system health.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Look for patterns or errors indicating the root cause.
4. **Implement Solutions**: Apply targeted fixes based on the diagnosis.
5. **Validate Resolution**: Confirm that the issue is resolved and the system is stable.

### Decision Points
- If the issue is related to disk space, proceed with cleanup and monitoring recommendations.
- If the issue involves informational requests, provide accurate and up-to-date documentation.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
- What specific issue are you experiencing (e.g., disconnections, errors)?
- Are there any error messages or logs available?
- What version of the EPP server are you currently using?
- Have there been any recent changes to the server environment?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Disk usage statistics from the EPP server.
- System logs indicating errors or warnings.
- Details about the current version and configuration of the EPP server.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Disk Space Exhaustion
- **Symptoms**: Frequent disconnections, server errors related to insufficient disk space.
- **Root Cause**: Accumulation of file shadows or other temporary files.
- **Resolution**: Delete unnecessary files (e.g., file shadows) and implement disk space monitoring.

### Scenario 2: Informational Requests
- **Symptoms**: Customer requests for the latest stable version, features, or bug fixes.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of access to updated documentation.
- **Resolution**: Provide the requested information and ensure documentation is readily available.

## Detailed Case Studies
### Case Study 1: Informational Request for CoSoSys Server Version
- **Ticket ID**: [500Qk00000BNgRgIAL](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000BNgRgIAL/view)
- **Initial Symptoms**: Customer requested details about the latest stable version of the CoSoSys server.
- **Diagnostic Steps**:
  1. Reviewed the customer's request.
  2. Compiled information about the latest version, including features and bug fixes.
- **Key Information**: The customer needed this data to plan an upgrade.
- **Resolution**: Provided the requested details, ensuring the customer had all necessary information for a successful upgrade.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Maintain up-to-date documentation on software versions.
  - Follow up with customers to confirm successful upgrades.

### Case Study 2: Disk Space Exhaustion Causing Disconnections
- **Ticket ID**: [500Qk00000DP9F8IAL](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000DP9F8IAL/view)
- **Initial Symptoms**: Customer reported frequent disconnections from the EPP server.
- **Diagnostic Steps**:
  1. Verified disk space on the server.
  2. Identified that file shadows had consumed all available space.
  3. Deleted unnecessary files to free up disk space.
- **Key Information**: Disk space was completely occupied, leading to server instability.
- **Resolution**: Freed up 90% of disk space by deleting file shadows, restoring normal operations.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Regularly monitor disk space to prevent similar issues.
  - Consider automated cleanup processes for temporary files.

## Best Practices & Tips
- **Documentation**: Keep a centralized repository of the latest software versions, features, and bug fixes.
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: Implement automated alerts for low disk space to proactively address issues.
- **Customer Communication**: Follow up with customers after providing solutions to ensure their needs are fully met.
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule regular server health checks, including disk space audits and log reviews.
- **Automation**: Use scripts or tools to automate the cleanup of temporary files, such as file shadows.

## Escalation Guidelines
### Criteria for Escalation
- Issues that cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting steps.
- Problems requiring development team intervention (e.g., software bugs).
- High-priority incidents affecting multiple customers or critical systems.

### Escalation Procedure
1. Document all diagnostic steps taken and information collected.
2. Clearly define the issue and its impact.
3. Submit the case to the appropriate escalation team with all relevant details.
4. Notify the customer of the escalation and provide regular updates.
