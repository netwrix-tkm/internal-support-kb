# Netwrix Endpoint Protector: Device Control - Device Groups Reference Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting and resolving issues related to the **Device Groups** feature within the **Device Control** component of **Netwrix Endpoint Protector**. Device Groups are critical for managing device access policies, ensuring data security, and maintaining compliance with organizational requirements. Understanding and effectively addressing issues in this category is essential for providing consistent and reliable support to customers.

---

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Device Groups**: Logical groupings of devices that allow administrators to apply specific policies, such as access restrictions or permissions, to a set of devices.
- **Device Control**: A feature within Netwrix Endpoint Protector that enables granular control over device usage, including blocking or allowing specific devices or functionalities.
- **Policy Settings**: Configurations applied to Device Groups to enforce security measures, such as blocking Bluetooth data transfer or whitelisting specific devices.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Endpoint Protector**: A data security solution designed to prevent data loss and enforce device usage policies.
- **Azure Active Directory (AD)**: Often integrated with Endpoint Protector for user and group synchronization.
- **SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)**: A tool used for deploying scripts or managing Endpoint Protector agents across multiple endpoints.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- Inability to block specific device functionalities (e.g., Bluetooth data transfer).
- Errors or confusion when adding or removing devices from groups.
- Problems generating reports based on group-wise settings.
- Challenges in managing device group priorities.
- Issues with synchronization or migration of users and groups.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues affecting security compliance (e.g., inability to block data transfer).
- **Medium Priority**: Operational inefficiencies (e.g., difficulty managing group priorities).
- **Low Priority**: User misunderstandings or requests for guidance.
