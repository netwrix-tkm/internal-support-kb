# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting License Errors in PingCastle

## Overview

This guide focuses on resolving issues related to license errors in PingCastle, specifically within the context of sales, renewals, and licensing. Licensing issues can prevent customers from accessing critical features, impacting their ability to use the product effectively. Understanding and resolving these issues promptly is essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring seamless product usage.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **PingCastle Licensing System**: PingCastle uses a licensing interface accessible through the "My Products" section of the customer portal. Licenses must be renewed or updated to maintain product functionality.
- **License Expiration**: When a license expires, customers must purchase and activate a new license to continue using the product.
- **Licensing Interface Updates**: The interface may change with updates, potentially altering the location or availability of options like "Update License."

### Terminology
- **License Key**: A unique identifier that activates the product.
- **My Products Section**: The portal area where customers manage their licenses.
- **Licensing Tab**: A subsection of the portal where license-related actions are performed.

### System Context
The licensing system is integrated into the PingCastle customer portal. It interacts with backend systems to validate license keys and update customer entitlements. Any misalignment between the portal interface and customer expectations can lead to confusion.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Customers report being unable to update or activate a new license.
- The "Update License" option is missing or not visible in the "My Products" section.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Customer's license is expired, and they cannot use the product.
- **Medium Priority**: Customer is confused about the process but has an active license.
- **Low Priority**: General inquiries about licensing procedures.

## Diagnostic Methodology

1. **Verify the Customer's Account and License Status**:
   - Confirm the customer's account details and check if the new license has been purchased and associated with their account.

2. **Check the Licensing Interface Version**:
   - Determine if the customer is using the latest version of the licensing interface. Updates may change the location of options.

3. **Review Documentation Alignment**:
   - Ensure the customer is referencing the correct and up-to-date documentation for their version of the interface.

4. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Attempt to replicate the customer's steps in a test environment to identify discrepancies.

5. **Escalate if Necessary**:
   - If the issue cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting, escalate to the licensing team.
