# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Access Information Center (AIC) Issues in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Overview
The Access Information Center (AIC) in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor is a critical feature that provides visibility into file share activities and statistics. It enables organizations to monitor access events, track changes, and generate reports for compliance and security purposes. Understanding and troubleshooting issues related to AIC is essential for ensuring accurate data collection and reporting, which directly impacts operational efficiency and compliance adherence.

This guide provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving issues where AIC does not display expected results, focusing on common scenarios, diagnostic methodologies, and best practices.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Access Information Center (AIC):** A module within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor that aggregates and displays file share activity data, including access events and statistics.
- **File Share Monitoring:** AIC relies on data collected from file servers to generate reports. Proper configuration and permissions are essential for accurate data collection.
- **Event Logs:** AIC uses event logs from monitored file servers to populate its reports. Missing or misconfigured logs can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** Issues discussed in this guide pertain to version 11.6.
- **Data Flow:** File server activity is captured via event logs, processed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, and displayed in AIC.
- **User Interaction:** Users access AIC to view reports and analyze file share activities. Misinterpretation of report access methods can lead to perceived issues.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- AIC does not display file share activity or statistics.
- Reports appear empty or incomplete.
- Users report discrepancies between expected and actual data.

### Categorization
- **Configuration Issues:** Problems with file server monitoring settings or permissions.
- **Data Collection Issues:** Missing or incomplete event logs.
- **User Misunderstanding:** Incorrect report access or interpretation.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority:** If the issue impacts compliance reporting or security monitoring.
- **Medium Priority:** If the issue affects operational visibility but does not pose immediate risks.
- **Low Priority:** If the issue is due to user misunderstanding and can be resolved through guidance.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Verify Symptoms:**
   - Confirm the specific reports or data points the user is unable to access.
   - Ask for screenshots or examples of the missing data.

2. **Check Configuration:**
   - Ensure file server monitoring is enabled and properly configured.
   - Verify permissions for accessing event logs.

3. **Review Event Logs:**
   - Examine event logs on the monitored file servers for relevant activity.
   - Look for gaps or errors in log collection.

4. **Validate User Actions:**
   - Confirm the steps the user is taking to access reports.
   - Identify any misunderstandings in report navigation or interpretation.

5. **Escalate if Necessary:**
   - If the issue cannot be resolved through configuration or user guidance, escalate to the development or product team for further investigation.
