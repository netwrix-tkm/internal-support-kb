# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Understanding and Troubleshooting Delegable Admins in Active Directory Reports

## Overview

This guide focuses on troubleshooting and resolving issues related to the identification of "delegable admins" in Active Directory (AD) reports generated by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Understanding this category is critical for ensuring the security of privileged accounts and mitigating risks associated with improper delegation in Active Directory environments.

### Purpose
- To provide a systematic approach for diagnosing and resolving issues related to "delegable admins."
- To clarify the technical criteria and implications of delegation in Active Directory.
- To equip support engineers with the tools and knowledge to handle customer inquiries effectively.

### Scope
This guide applies to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 and later, specifically focusing on the Active Directory Solution and the "weak passwords job" or related reports.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
1. **Delegable Admins**: Accounts in Active Directory that are eligible for delegation due to their configuration and group membership.
2. **Delegation in AD**: A mechanism that allows a user or service to act on behalf of another user, often used in Kerberos authentication scenarios.
3. **Sensitive Accounts**: Accounts marked as "sensitive and cannot be delegated" to prevent unauthorized delegation.
4. **`adminCount` Attribute**: A key attribute in AD that identifies accounts as members of protected administrative groups (e.g., Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins).

### System Context
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor**: A platform for auditing and reporting on IT infrastructure changes, configurations, and security risks.
- **Weak Passwords Job**: A report that identifies accounts with weak passwords and evaluates their delegation status.
- **Active Directory Solution**: A component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor that provides insights into AD configurations, permissions, and security risks.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Customer inquiries about the criteria for identifying "delegable admins."
- Confusion regarding the "trusted for delegation" setting in AD reports.
- Concerns about the security implications of delegation for privileged accounts.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: If the issue involves privileged accounts or potential security risks.
- **Medium Priority**: If the issue is informational or involves non-critical accounts.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Understand the Customer's Environment**:
   - Confirm the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version.
   - Identify the specific report or job in question (e.g., Weak Passwords Job).
2. **Clarify the Inquiry**:
   - Determine whether the customer is asking about technical criteria, security implications, or both.
3. **Review Documentation**:
   - Refer to internal documentation for the AD_WeakPasswords Job and AD_UserDelegation Job.
4. **Engage Development Team (if needed)**:
   - Confirm technical details about how "delegable admins" are identified.
5. **Provide Clear Explanation**:
   - Use customer-friendly language to explain technical concepts and security best practices.

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask the Customer
- What specific report or job are you reviewing?
- Are there particular accounts or groups you are concerned about?
- Have you configured any accounts as "sensitive and cannot be delegated"?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Export of the relevant report (e.g., Weak Passwords Job output).
- Screenshots of the account properties in Active Directory.
- Configuration details for the "trusted for delegation" setting.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Misunderstanding of "Delegable Admin" Criteria
- **Symptoms**: Customer is unclear about why certain accounts are flagged as delegable admins.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Explain that accounts are flagged as delegable if:
     - They are not marked as "sensitive and cannot be delegated."
     - They are members of administrative groups (e.g., Domain Admins).
  2. Provide guidance on enabling the "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" setting for privileged accounts.

### Scenario 2: Security Concerns About Delegation
- **Symptoms**: Customer expresses concerns about the risks of delegation for privileged accounts.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Highlight the importance of marking sensitive accounts as "sensitive and cannot be delegated."
  2. Share best practices for managing delegation in Active Directory.

## Detailed Case Studies

### Case Study: Ticket [500Qk00000Ctd8HIAR](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Ctd8HIAR/view)

#### Initial Symptoms
The customer inquired about the criteria for identifying "delegable admins" in the Weak Passwords Job report and sought clarification on the "trusted for delegation" setting.

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Reviewed the AD_WeakPasswords Job and AD_UserDelegation Job documentation.
2. Engaged with the development team to confirm the technical criteria for "delegable admins."
3. Communicated with the customer to clarify their specific concerns.

#### Key Information
- Accounts are flagged as delegable if:
  - They are not marked as "sensitive and cannot be delegated."
  - They are members of administrative groups (e.g., Domain Admins).
- The `adminCount` attribute (`adminCount = 1`) is used to identify administrative accounts.

#### Resolution
- Provided a detailed explanation of the criteria for "delegable admins."
- Shared best practices for configuring sensitive accounts to prevent unauthorized delegation.
- Directed the customer to relevant documentation and resources.

#### Key Takeaways
- Clear documentation is essential for customer understanding.
- Sensitive accounts should always be configured to prevent delegation.

#### Efficiency Improvements
- Update product documentation to include detailed explanations of "delegable admin" criteria.
- Create a knowledge base article for common delegation-related inquiries.

## Best Practices & Tips

1. **Mark Sensitive Accounts Appropriately**:
   - Always enable the "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" setting for privileged accounts.
2. **Educate Customers on Delegation Risks**:
   - Explain the security implications of delegation and how to mitigate risks.
3. **Leverage Documentation**:
   - Use internal and external resources to provide clear, accurate answers.
4. **Engage Development Teams When Needed**:
   - Collaborate with developers to confirm technical details and ensure accurate responses.

## Escalation Guidelines

### When to Escalate
- The issue involves a potential security breach or critical account misconfiguration.
- The customer requires a deeper technical explanation beyond the scope of support documentation.
- The problem persists despite following standard troubleshooting steps.

### How to Escalate
1. Gather all relevant information, including logs, screenshots, and customer inquiries.
2. Document the troubleshooting steps already taken.
3. Submit the case to the development team or senior support engineers for further analysis.
