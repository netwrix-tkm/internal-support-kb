# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Sensitive Data Issues in StealthAUDIT for SharePoint

## Overview

Sensitive Data issues in StealthAUDIT for SharePoint are critical to address as they directly impact the ability to scan, import, and analyze sensitive data within SharePoint environments. These issues can arise due to system resource constraints, database conflicts, licensing limitations, or software bugs. Understanding how to diagnose and resolve these problems ensures uninterrupted functionality and compliance with data governance requirements.

This guide provides a systematic approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues related to Sensitive Data functionality in StealthAUDIT for SharePoint.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **SPPEEK Scan**: A scheduled scan process used to identify sensitive data within SharePoint environments.
- **SPSEEK Bulk Import**: A job that imports sensitive data findings into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor database for further analysis.
- **Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD)**: A licensed feature that enables scanning and reporting on sensitive data.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Database rules that enforce relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Database**: Central repository for storing audit data, including sensitive data findings.
- **StealthAUDIT for SharePoint**: A component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor designed to audit SharePoint environments for sensitive data and other compliance-related metrics.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Scheduled scans freezing or becoming unresponsive.
- Errors during bulk import jobs, such as database constraint violations.
- Licensing-related errors preventing the execution of sensitive data scans.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues that prevent scans or imports from completing, impacting compliance reporting.
- **Medium Priority**: Errors that can be resolved with patches or configuration changes.
- **Low Priority**: Licensing-related issues that require clarification but do not involve technical failures.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Verify Symptoms**: Confirm the reported issue by reviewing logs, error messages, and system behavior.
2. **Check System Resources**: Assess CPU, memory, and disk usage to rule out resource constraints.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Examine debug logs and tier 2 files for error codes and patterns.
4. **Investigate Database Integrity**: Check for foreign key constraint violations or missing tables.
5. **Review Licensing**: Confirm the customerâ€™s licensing status for Sensitive Data Discovery.
6. **Engage Development**: If the issue involves software bugs, escalate to the development team for analysis.

## Information Collection

### Customer Queries
- What is the exact error message or behavior observed?
- When did the issue first occur?
- Has any recent patch or hotfix been applied?
- Are there any changes to the SharePoint environment or database configuration?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Debug logs and tier 2 files from the affected scan or import job.
- Database error messages and SQL logs.
- System resource utilization metrics during the scan or import process.
- Licensing details for Sensitive Data Discovery.
