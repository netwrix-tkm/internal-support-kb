## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA):** A platform for auditing IT infrastructure, providing insights into user activity, system changes, and sensitive data access.
- **Management Console:** The primary interface for configuring, managing, and monitoring NEA jobs and settings.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A security feature that restricts user permissions based on assigned roles.
- **Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD):** A module for identifying and managing sensitive information across file systems and databases.
- **File System Activity Collector (FSAC):** A component for monitoring file system activity and collecting audit data.

### Terminology
- **SQL Connection:** The link between NEA and its database, critical for job execution and data storage.
- **Job Scheduling:** The process of configuring and running tasks within NEA, such as data collection or reporting.
- **XML Configuration Files:** Files used by NEA to store settings and job configurations.
- **Debug Logging:** A diagnostic mode that captures detailed logs for troubleshooting.

### System Context
- NEA relies on SQL databases for storing audit data and configurations.
- The Management Console interacts with various modules, including FSAC and SDD, to execute jobs and display results.
- Proper configuration of roles, permissions, and job schedules is essential for seamless operation.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Identifying Issues
- **Symptoms:** Console hangs, job failures, access errors, or unexpected behavior.
- **Error Messages:** Specific messages such as "Root element is missing" or "Could not add hosts from list."
- **Customer Reports:** Descriptions of performance issues, access problems, or data discrepancies.

### Assessing Priority
- **High Priority:** Issues causing complete console inaccessibility or data loss.
- **Medium Priority:** Job execution delays or partial functionality loss.
- **Low Priority:** Cosmetic issues or minor configuration concerns.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Reproduce the Issue:** Attempt to replicate the problem in the customer's environment.
2. **Review Logs:** Examine application, SQL, and debug logs for error patterns.
3. **Check Configuration:** Verify settings in the NEA console, registry, and configuration files.
4. **Isolate Components:** Determine if the issue is related to a specific module or job.
5. **Test Resolutions:** Apply potential fixes incrementally and monitor results.

### Decision Points
- **Access Issues:** Focus on RBAC settings and SQL credentials.
- **Job Failures:** Investigate job schedules, database performance, and configuration files.
- **Performance Problems:** Analyze resource utilization and overlapping tasks.

## Information Collection

### Customer Queries
- What is the exact error message or behavior observed?
- When did the issue first occur, and has it happened before?
- Are there any recent changes to the environment (e.g., updates, new jobs)?
- What is the scope of the issue (e.g., specific jobs, all users)?

### Logs and Data
- **Application Logs:** Located in the NEA installation directory.
- **SQL Logs:** For database-related errors.
- **Debug Logs:** Enable debug mode for detailed diagnostics.
- **Configuration Files:** XML files in the Reports or Jobs directories.
