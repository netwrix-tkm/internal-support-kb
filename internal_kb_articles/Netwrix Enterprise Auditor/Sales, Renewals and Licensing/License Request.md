# Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: License Request Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to license requests in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. It covers the identification, diagnosis, and resolution of problems stemming from expired or inactive licenses, ensuring minimal disruption to customer operations. Understanding and addressing these issues is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction and uninterrupted product functionality.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **License Expiration**: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor licenses are time-bound and must be renewed to maintain access to the product's features.
- **License Activation**: After renewal, the new license must be applied to the system to restore functionality.
- **Communication Channels**: Effective communication with customers is essential for resolving licensing issues, especially when time-sensitive.

### System Context

- Error messages indicating an expired license.

### Priority Assessment

- **Medium Priority**: Cases involving upcoming license expirations where proactive renewal is required.

## Diagnostic Methodology

1. **Verify License Status**:
   - Confirm the reported issue by checking the license status in the customer's account.
   - Determine if the license has expired or if a new license has been issued but not applied.

2. **Check Communication Logs**:
   - Review email or Salesforce communication to ensure the customer has received renewal notifications.

3. **Assess Urgency**:
   - Determine the impact on the customer's operations to prioritize the case appropriately.
