# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Unix Integration in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to integrating Unix systems with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically using the StealthAUDIT for Unix component. Proper integration is critical for ensuring accurate data collection and auditing capabilities. This document outlines systematic approaches, common scenarios, and best practices to help support engineers resolve these issues efficiently and consistently.

---

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor**: A platform for auditing and monitoring IT environments, including Unix/Linux systems.
- **StealthAUDIT for Unix**: A component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor designed to collect data from Unix/Linux systems.
- **Least Privilege Model**: A security principle requiring accounts to have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **SUDO Access**: Privileged access that allows specific commands to be executed with elevated permissions.

### System Context
- **Operating System**: Unix/Linux systems, such as RedHat Linux 7.9.
- **Connectivity Requirements**: SSH (port 22) must be open for communication between the Netwrix collector and the Unix system.
- **Account Permissions**: Proper configuration of account permissions, including SUDO access, is mandatory for successful integration.

---

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- "Access Denied" errors during scanning or data collection.
- Failure to connect to the Unix system via SSH.
- Inability to retrieve data from the Unix system.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues affecting critical auditing tasks or compliance reporting.
- **Medium Priority**: Integration issues during initial setup or testing.
- **Low Priority**: Non-urgent configuration questions or documentation requests.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Verify Connectivity**:
   - Confirm that SSH (port 22) is open and accessible from the Netwrix server.
   - Test connectivity using tools like `telnet` or `ssh`.

2. **Check Account Permissions**:
   - Ensure the account used for scanning has the necessary permissions, including SUDO access.
   - Verify adherence to the Least Privilege Model.

3. **Review Configuration**:
   - Confirm that the Unix module is correctly configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
   - Cross-check settings against the official documentation.

4. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Collect and review logs from both the Netwrix server and the Unix system for error messages or connectivity issues.

5. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment to isolate the root cause.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask the Customer
- What is the operating system and version of the Unix system?
- Are there any firewalls or network restrictions that could block SSH (port 22)?
- What account is being used for scanning, and does it have SUDO access?
- Have any recent changes been made to the Unix system or its configuration?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor logs (e.g., collector logs).
- SSH server logs from the Unix system.
- Screenshots or error messages related to the issue.
- Configuration details of the Unix module in Netwrix.

---

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: "Access Denied" Errors
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect account permissions.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that the scanning account has SUDO access.
  2. Update permissions to align with the Least Privilege Model.
  3. Test scanning after applying the changes.

### Scenario 2: SSH Connectivity Issues
- **Root Cause**: Port 22 blocked by a firewall or network restriction.
- **Solution**:
  1. Confirm that port 22 is open and accessible.
  2. Work with the customerâ€™s network team to resolve any connectivity issues.

### Scenario 3: Misconfigured Unix Module
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect settings in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor configuration.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review the Unix module configuration.
  2. Cross-check settings against the official documentation.
  3. Correct any discrepancies and retest.

## Detailed Case Studies
### Case Study: Ticket [500Qk00000O1ql7IAB](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000O1ql7IAB/view)
#### Initial Symptoms
The customer reported "Access Denied" errors when attempting to scan a RedHat Linux 7.9 server.

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Verified SSH connectivity on port 22.
2. Reviewed account permissions and identified that the scanning account lacked SUDO access.
3. Scheduled a remote session to assist with configuration.

#### Key Information Leading to Resolution
- Logs indicated permission-related errors during scanning attempts.
- The customer confirmed that the account did not have the required SUDO access.

#### Resolution
- Provided documentation on the Least Privilege Model.
- Guided the customer in configuring the account with the necessary permissions, including SUDO access.
- Verified successful scanning after the changes were applied.

#### Key Takeaways
- Always verify account permissions before initiating scanning tasks.
- Ensure customers understand the importance of the Least Privilege Model.

#### Efficiency Improvements
- Develop a pre-checklist for Unix integration tasks to streamline initial diagnostics.

## Best Practices & Tips
1. **Pre-Integration Checklist**:
   - Verify SSH connectivity and open ports.
   - Confirm account permissions and SUDO access.
   - Review Unix module configuration settings.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Provide customers with clear, step-by-step guides for configuring permissions and settings.

3. **Customer Communication**:
   - Use precise, non-technical language when explaining configuration changes.
   - Follow up to ensure the customer has successfully implemented the recommended changes.

4. **Log Analysis**:
   - Regularly review logs for common error patterns to build a knowledge base of solutions.
