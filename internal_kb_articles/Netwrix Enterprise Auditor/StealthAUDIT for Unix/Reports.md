# Knowledge Base Reference Guide: Troubleshooting Report Data Truncation in StealthAUDIT for Unix

## Overview
This guide addresses issues related to data truncation in reports generated by the StealthAUDIT for Unix component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. These issues typically arise when database field character limits are insufficient to accommodate the collected data. Understanding and resolving these problems is critical for ensuring accurate reporting and compliance with auditing requirements.

## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **StealthAUDIT for Unix**: A component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor designed to collect and analyze data from Unix/Linux systems.
- **Reports**: Output generated by StealthAUDIT jobs, often used for auditing purposes.
- **Database Field Character Limits**: Constraints on the maximum number of characters a database column can store. If the collected data exceeds this limit, truncation occurs, leading to incomplete reports.

### System Context
- Reports are generated based on data collected from Unix/Linux systems and stored in a database.
- Each database column has a predefined character limit, which must be sufficient to store the largest expected data set.
- Truncation can hinder compliance efforts by omitting critical information required by auditors.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Reports display incomplete data in specific columns, such as `GROUPMEMBERS`.
- Customers may report difficulty in providing complete information to auditors.

### Priority Assessment
- High Priority: If the issue impacts compliance or auditing processes.
- Medium Priority: If the issue affects reporting accuracy but does not immediately hinder compliance.

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Confirm the Issue**: Verify the reported truncation by reviewing the affected report.
2. **Identify the Column**: Determine which database column is truncating data.
3. **Check Character Limits**: Review the current character limit for the column in question.
4. **Analyze Data Volume**: Assess whether the collected data exceeds the column's limit.

### Decision Points
- If the character limit is insufficient, proceed to resolution steps.
- If the issue is unrelated to character limits, escalate for further investigation.

## Information Collection
### Customer Requests
- **Export of the Job**: Request the job configuration and output for analysis.
- **Screenshots or Images**: Ask for visual evidence of the truncation issue.
- **Environment Details**: Confirm the product version, affected component, and database configuration.

### Logs to Examine
- **Database Schema**: Review the schema to identify column character limits.
- **Job Execution Logs**: Analyze logs for errors or warnings related to data collection.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Column Character Limit Insufficient
- **Symptoms**: Data truncation in reports; column limit set too low.
- **Resolution**: Increase the character limit for the affected column in the database schema.

### Scenario 2: Unexpected Data Growth
- **Symptoms**: Reports previously worked but now truncate data due to increased data volume.
- **Resolution**: Adjust column limits to accommodate the new data size and monitor for future growth.

## Detailed Case Studies
### Case Study: Ticket ID [500Qk00000CRzRxIAL](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000CRzRxIAL/view)
#### Initial Symptoms
The customer reported that the `GROUPMEMBERS` column in the Linux sudoers report was truncating data, preventing complete information from being provided to auditors.

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Requested a PowerShell script output to gather environment details.
2. Asked the customer to provide an export of the job and relevant screenshots.
3. Confirmed the account name and linked the ticket to previous cases for context.
4. Reviewed the database schema and identified the `GROUPMEMBERS` column's character limit as 250.

#### Key Information Leading to Resolution
The truncation was directly caused by the column's character limit being insufficient for the collected data.

#### Resolution
Increased the character limit for the `GROUPMEMBERS` column from 250 to 400 characters. This adjustment resolved the issue, allowing the report to display all necessary data.

#### Key Takeaways
- Always verify database column limits when truncation issues are reported.
- Consider potential data growth when setting character limits to avoid future problems.

#### Efficiency Improvements
- Implement proactive monitoring of database schema limits to identify potential issues before they impact customers.

## Best Practices & Tips
- **Proactive Configuration**: Set database column limits with a buffer to accommodate potential data growth.
- **Customer Communication**: Clearly explain the root cause and resolution steps to customers to build trust and confidence.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of database schema changes for future reference.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly review reports and logs for signs of truncation or other anomalies.

## Escalation Guidelines
### Criteria for Escalation
- The issue persists after increasing column limits.
- The root cause is unclear or involves complex database interactions.
- The problem impacts multiple customers or critical systems.

### Escalation Procedures
1. Document all troubleshooting steps and findings.
2. Provide detailed logs, job exports, and screenshots to the escalation team.
3. Notify the customer of the escalation and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.
