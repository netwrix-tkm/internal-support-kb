# Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: Troubleshooting Exchange Online Integration Issues

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting issues related to Exchange Online integration within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA), specifically focusing on the StealthAUDIT for Exchange component. Exchange Online integration is critical for organizations leveraging NEA to audit and monitor their cloud-based Exchange environments.

## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **Exchange Online Integration**: The process of connecting NEA to Microsoft Exchange Online to collect audit data, generate reports, and monitor activity.
- **StealthAUDIT for Exchange**: A collector module in NEA designed to gather data from Exchange environments, including Exchange Online.
- **Public Folders**: Shared folders in Exchange used for collaboration, which may require special handling during migrations or reporting.
- **Termed Users**: Disabled or inactive user accounts in Exchange Online that can cause errors during data collection if not properly excluded.

### System Context
- **Connection Profiles**: Define how NEA connects to Exchange Online, including authentication and host settings.
- **Host List**: Specifies the servers or endpoints NEA interacts with for data collection.
- **Job Groups**: Logical groupings of data collection jobs, such as Exchange Online or Public Folders jobs.
- **Permissions**: Exchange Online requires specific permissions for NEA to access data, including MAPI-based permissions for certain reports.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Symptoms
- Errors during Exchange Online job processing.
- Blank or incomplete reports.
- Jobs failing to complete or populate necessary data tables.

### Categorization
1. **Configuration Issues**: Problems with connection profiles, host lists, or job group assignments.
2. **Data Collection Errors**: Failures caused by termed users, missing permissions, or incorrect settings.
3. **Migration-Related Issues**: Misconfigurations following a transition from Exchange On-Prem to Exchange Online.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Jobs failing to run or critical reports not generating.
- **Medium Priority**: Errors related to specific users or folders but not affecting overall functionality.
- **Low Priority**: Minor configuration adjustments or optimization requests.

3. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Collect and review job logs for error messages or warnings.
   - Look for patterns indicating specific issues (e.g., termed users causing errors).

4. **Test Adjustments**:
   - Apply configuration changes incrementally and test after each adjustment.
   - Run jobs manually to verify functionality.

5. **Validate Results**:
   - Confirm that jobs complete successfully and reports are populated with accurate data.
