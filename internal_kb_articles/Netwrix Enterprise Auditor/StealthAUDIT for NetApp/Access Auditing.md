## Technical Background
### Key Concepts
- **Access Auditing**: A feature that scans file systems to monitor and report on access permissions, inheritance, and open access vulnerabilities.
- **StealthAUDIT for NetApp**: A collector within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor designed to audit NetApp file systems.
- **FSAA (File System Access Auditing)**: Scans file systems for access permissions and inheritance issues.
- **FSAC (File System Activity Collection)**: Collects activity logs from file systems for auditing purposes.
- **RPC Timeout**: A remote procedure call timeout that occurs when a scan exceeds the configured time limit.
- **NetBIOS Name Limit**: A 15-character limit for NetBIOS names, which can impact communication between servers.

### System Context
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor**: A platform for auditing IT environments, including file systems, Active Directory, and more.
- **Database Dependencies**: Scans rely on database tables and views for storing and processing data.
- **Network Dependencies**: Scans require proper DNS resolution, open ports, and network connectivity between the StealthAUDIT server, proxy servers, and target hosts.

---

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Scan failures with specific error messages (e.g., "RPC Timeout," "Invalid object name").
- Unexpected termination of scan jobs.
- Missing or outdated data in reports.
- Connectivity issues with target hosts or proxy servers.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues causing complete scan failures or data loss.
- **Medium Priority**: Errors affecting specific jobs or hosts but not the entire system.
- **Low Priority**: Non-critical errors or warnings that do not impact functionality.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology
### Systematic Approach
1. **Error Identification**: Review error messages and logs to determine the nature of the issue.
2. **Environment Analysis**: Verify system configurations, including DNS, network connectivity, and database integrity.
3. **Replication**: Attempt to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment.
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the underlying cause using logs, configuration files, and customer input.
5. **Resolution Testing**: Apply fixes and verify their effectiveness.

### Decision Points
- Can the issue be resolved by adjusting configurations (e.g., timeout settings, folder names)?
- Is the issue related to a known product defect requiring an upgrade or patch?
- Does the issue require escalation to R&D for further investigation?

---

## Information Collection
### Customer Queries
- What error messages are being observed?
- Have there been recent changes to the environment (e.g., folder naming conventions, server upgrades)?
- Are there specific hosts or jobs affected?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Scan logs and error messages.
- Event Viewer logs from the StealthAUDIT server.
- Database tables and views related to the affected jobs.
- Network diagnostics (e.g., Test-NetConnection results, DNS records).

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: RPC Timeout Errors
- **Symptoms**: Scans fail with timeout errors.
- **Root Cause**: Timeout settings are too low for large or complex file systems.
- **Solution**: Increase timeout settings and ensure folder names comply with system limits. [Example Case](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000DjRhKIAV/view)

### Scenario 2: Decommissioned Hosts in Reports
- **Symptoms**: Decommissioned hosts appear in reports despite being removed from host management.
- **Root Cause**: Residual data in the database.
- **Solution**: Create a job to remove data for decommissioned hosts and re-run the report. [Example Case](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000M3caOIAR/view)

### Scenario 3: Database Binding Errors
- **Symptoms**: Errors referencing invalid database objects during scan jobs.
- **Root Cause**: Defects in specific product versions.
- **Solution**: Upgrade to the latest version and clear conflicting database objects. [Example Case](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000GG0EAIA1/view)

### Scenario 4: DNS Resolution Issues
- **Symptoms**: Scans fail to connect to target hosts.
- **Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect DNS records.
- **Solution**: Update DNS records to ensure proper resolution of hostnames and FQDNs. [Example Case](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Lb1NeIAJ/view)

### Scenario 5: NetBIOS Name Length Exceeding 15 Characters
- **Symptoms**: Communication failures between servers.
- **Root Cause**: Hostnames exceeding the NetBIOS limit.
- **Solution**: Shorten hostnames to comply with the 15-character limit. [Example Case](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000NdmkIIAR/view)

## Best Practices & Tips
- **Timeout Settings**: Adjust based on the size and complexity of the file system.
- **Folder Naming Conventions**: Enforce limits on length and special characters.
- **DNS Records**: Ensure proper resolution for all hosts, including FQDN and short names.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the product updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and enhancements.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Use logs and reports to identify potential issues before they escalate.
