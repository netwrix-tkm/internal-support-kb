## Technical Background

### Key Concepts
- **StealthAUDIT for NetApp**: A module within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor designed to monitor and audit NetApp storage systems for activity, permissions, and configuration compliance.
- **FPolicy Protocol**: A critical protocol for monitoring file system activity on NetApp appliances. Its availability varies by appliance type (e.g., Azure NetApp Files vs. NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP).
- **FSAA (File System Activity Audit)**: A scan that collects activity data from file shares.
- **FSAC (File System Activity Collection)**: A process that imports and processes activity data into the database.
- **Proxy Hosts**: Intermediate systems used to facilitate communication between StealthAUDIT and target NetApp appliances.

### System Context
- **NetApp Appliances**: Can be on-premise or cloud-based (e.g., Azure NetApp Files, NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP).
- **Database Dependencies**: StealthAUDIT relies on SQL databases for storing and processing collected data.
- **Permissions and Pathing**: Proper configuration of permissions and UNC paths is critical for successful scans and data visibility.

## Issue Recognition & Triage

### Common Symptoms
- Scans failing to start or complete.
- Missing or incorrect data in reports (e.g., Open Access job not identifying shares).
- Prolonged scan durations or SQL performance issues.
- Errors related to proxy host configuration or communication.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Scans failing entirely, critical data missing, or SQL server performance severely impacted.
- **Medium Priority**: Delayed scans or partial data collection.
- **Low Priority**: Minor configuration issues or cosmetic errors in reports.

## Diagnostic Methodology

### Systematic Approach
1. **Understand the Environment**: Gather details about the customer's NetApp appliance type, version, and configuration.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify permissions, open ports, and service statuses.
4. **Analyze Logs**: Collect and review relevant logs for errors or anomalies.
5. **Test Solutions Incrementally**: Apply changes step-by-step and validate results.

### Decision Points
- Is the issue related to communication (e.g., blocked ports, proxy misconfiguration)?
- Are permissions and credentials correctly configured?
- Are there database or pathing inconsistencies?

---

## Information Collection

### Questions to Ask Customers
- What type of NetApp appliance are you using (e.g., Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Volumes ONTAP)?
- Have there been recent changes to your environment (e.g., migrations, upgrades)?
- Are there specific error messages or symptoms observed?

### Logs to Collect
- **Scan Job Logs**: For FSAA, FSAC, and related jobs.
- **SQL Server Logs**: To identify performance bottlenecks or table lock issues.
- **Proxy Configuration Logs**: To verify communication settings.
- **Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode for detailed analysis if necessary.

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Compatibility Issues with Azure NetApp Files
- **Symptoms**: Activity Monitor unable to collect data.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of FPolicy protocol support.
- **Solution**: Confirm appliance type and advise on roadmap updates for FPolicy support. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000BehzBIAR/view)

### Scenario 2: Prolonged Bulk Import Times
- **Symptoms**: FSAA Bulk Import taking hours instead of minutes.
- **Root Cause**: Excessive SQL reads due to overlapping host configurations.
- **Solution**: Clean up overlapping host entries and monitor SQL performance. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000BwG9KIAV/view)

### Scenario 3: Open Access Job Not Updating
- **Symptoms**: New shares not appearing in reports.
- **Root Cause**: Misconfigured FSAA Exceptions job and decommissioned host data.
- **Solution**: Correct job configurations and re-run FSAA Exceptions. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000LHL2QIAX/view)

### Scenario 4: Proxy Host Misconfiguration
- **Symptoms**: FSAC jobs failing with proxy-related errors.
- **Root Cause**: Blocked ports, incorrect credentials, or disabled remote registry service.
- **Solution**: Unblock ports, update credentials, and enable remote registry. [Case Reference](https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000DjoqnIAB/view)
