## Overview
This guide focuses on troubleshooting issues related to report generation in the StealthAUDIT for Windows component of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Reports are a critical feature for customers, enabling them to audit and analyze data effectively. Understanding and resolving issues in this category ensures customer satisfaction and system reliability.

## Technical Background
StealthAUDIT for Windows is a powerful auditing tool within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, designed to collect, analyze, and report on data from Windows environments. Key features include:
- **Job Trees**: Hierarchical workflows that define auditing tasks.
- **Reports**: Outputs generated from collected data, providing actionable insights.
- **Tables**: Data storage structures used during audits, such as `_Details` tables for granular information.

Common challenges include stale data, incomplete scans, and file path limitations. These issues often stem from environmental factors, configuration errors, or system limitations.

## Issue Recognition & Triage
### Symptoms
- Reports fail to generate or contain incomplete data.
- Stale or outdated information persists in audit tables.
- Errors related to file path or name length during report generation.

### Priority Assessment
- **High Priority**: Issues affecting critical business operations, such as identifying privileged accounts or service configurations.
- **Medium Priority**: Errors impacting report generation but not critical workflows.
- **Low Priority**: Minor discrepancies or cosmetic issues in reports.

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Understand the Problem**: Review the customerâ€™s description and clarify the issue.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Attempt to replicate the problem in a controlled environment.
3. **Analyze Logs**: Examine job logs for errors or anomalies.
4. **Verify Configuration**: Check job settings, permissions, and environmental factors.
5. **Test Solutions Incrementally**: Apply fixes step-by-step and validate results.

## Information Collection
### Questions to Ask Customers
- What specific report or job is failing?
- Are there any error messages or logs available?
- Has the environment or configuration changed recently?
- What is the urgency of resolving this issue?

### Logs and Data to Collect
- Job execution logs.
- Screenshots of error messages.
- Configuration details for the affected job.
- Relevant registry settings (e.g., `LongPathsEnabled`).

## Common Scenarios & Solutions
### Scenario 1: Identifying Services Running with Specific AD Accounts
**Symptoms**: Customer needs to identify servers running services with a specific AD service account.

**Solution**:
1. Navigate to the job tree:  
   ```
   Windows > Privileged Accounts > Service Accounts > SG_ServiceAccounts > Results > ServiceAccounts
   ```
2. Generate a report listing all services, their statuses, and associated accounts.
3. Provide the report to the customer for analysis.

### Scenario 2: Stale Data in Local Admins Audit Table
**Symptoms**: Deleted or disabled users continue to appear as active in the `_Details` table.

**Solution**:
1. Rename the old `_Details` table to preserve data.
2. Execute the job against a smaller host to rebuild the table.
3. Configure the job to run against all hosts and clear the `_Details` table.
4. Verify permissions and protocols to ensure successful scans.

### Scenario 3: File Path Length Limitation
**Symptoms**: Report generation fails due to file path or name exceeding Windows limits.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the path and file name length.
2. Modify the registry key to enable long paths:  
   ```
   Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled
   ```
3. Move the job to a higher directory in the hierarchy to reduce path length.
4. Re-run the job and confirm successful report generation.
