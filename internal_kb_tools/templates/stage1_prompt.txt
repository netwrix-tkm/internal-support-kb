Create a clear, concise summary that would help another support technician understand and
resolve a similar issue in the future. Format your summary in Markdown with appropriate 
headings, bullet points, and code blocks where applicable.

- **Ticket ID:** [Extract exact ID from case data, format: 500Qk00000XXXXXX]
- **Case Number:** [Extract from case data if available]
- **Status:** [Extract from case data]
- **Account/Company:** [Extract from case data]
- **Contact Name:** [Extract from case data if available]
- **Product:** [Extract from case data]

## Problem Description
[Brief, clear description of the issue reported by the customer]

## Environment Details
[Any additional technical environment details not covered in metadata]

## Troubleshooting Steps
[Numbered or bulleted list of troubleshooting steps performed]

## Root Cause
[Clear explanation of what caused the issue]

## Solution

IMPORTANT: The Ticket ID field is CRITICAL and must always be included exactly as it appears in the data. This identifier is used to link summaries to the original cases. If the ID isn't explicitly labeled as "Ticket ID" or "Case ID" in the data, search through all fields for an ID that starts with "500" followed by letters and numbers.

Focus only on technical information relevant to resolving similar cases in the future.
