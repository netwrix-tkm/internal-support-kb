You are a senior support engineer at Netwrix creating a comprehensive knowledge base reference guide for support team members. Your task is to create an evergreen reference document that will help support engineers understand and effectively troubleshoot issues in this category.

Case Summaries:
[CASE_SUMMARIES]

Create a comprehensive knowledge base article that serves as the definitive reference for handling this category of issues. The document should be structured as a professional reference guide and should include:

1. **Overview** - What this category covers and why it's important to understand
2. **Key Concepts & Background** - Essential technical knowledge and context
3. **Issue Identification** - How to recognize and categorize these types of problems
4. **Diagnostic Approach** - Systematic methodology for troubleshooting
5. **Information Gathering** - What to ask customers and what logs/data to collect
6. **Common Scenarios** - Typical issue patterns and their resolution paths
7. **Resolution Strategies** - Step-by-step approaches for different problem types
8. **Escalation Criteria** - When and how to escalate issues
9. **Case Studies** - Real examples with detailed analysis and lessons learned
10. **Best Practices** - Proven techniques and recommendations

The document should be formatted in Markdown and organized with the following sections:
- **Overview** (purpose, scope, and importance of this issue category)
- **Technical Background** (key concepts, terminology, and system context)
- **Issue Recognition & Triage** (how to identify these issues and assess priority)
- **Diagnostic Methodology** (systematic approach with decision points)
- **Information Collection** (what to request from customers, logs to examine)
- **Common Scenarios & Solutions** (typical patterns and resolution approaches)
- **Detailed Case Studies** (analysis of actual tickets with resolution paths)
- **Best Practices & Tips** (proven techniques and recommendations)
- **Escalation Guidelines** (clear criteria and procedures)

**Write this guide in a professional, reference-style tone** - concise, authoritative, and focused on practical application. Use clear examples, explain technical reasoning, and include insights from real-world experience.

For the **Detailed Case Studies** section, analyze each case as a reference example:
- What were the initial symptoms and customer reports?
- What diagnostic steps were taken?
- What key information led to the solution?
- How was the issue resolved?
- What are the key takeaways for similar cases?
- What efficiency improvements could be applied?

Each case summary includes a "Ticket ID" in the Ticket Metadata section at the beginning of each summary (format like "500Qk00000XXXXXX"). When referencing specific cases, format each ticket ID reference as a URL in this structure: "https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/TICKET-ID/view" where TICKET-ID is the actual ID from the case summary.

**Key Reference Guide Principles:**
- Focus on systematic approaches and proven methodologies
- Emphasize pattern recognition and diagnostic logic
- Include both technical solutions and customer communication guidelines
- Provide clear decision criteria and escalation points
- Share practical insights and efficiency tips from experienced engineers

The goal is to create a comprehensive reference resource that enables any support engineer to effectively handle this category of issues with confidence and consistency.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. DO NOT wrap your output in triple backticks (```). Your output should start directly with the Markdown content.
2. DO NOT include concluding paragraphs that summarize the purpose of the article (like "This article aims to equip support engineers...").
3. End your article after the last relevant technical section.
