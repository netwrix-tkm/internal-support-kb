## Problem Description
The customer reported intermittent crashes of the Endpoint Protector client on macOS devices after deploying the application via Jamf. Despite these crashes, the application continued to function normally.

## Environment Details

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to take screenshots and extract log files when the issue occurs.
2. Provided the following commands for the customer to run if the issue reoccurs:
   ```bash
   cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
   cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
   cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
   cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
   cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
   ```
3. Monitored the situation for any further occurrences of the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the intermittent crashes was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. The issue had not reoccurred at the time of ticket closure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by monitoring the situation and requesting log files and screenshots from the customer if the crashes occurred again. Since the crashes did not reoccur, the customer requested to close the ticket, with the option to reopen if the issue arises again.

## Notes
- The customer should continue to monitor the application for any further crashes and be prepared to provide logs and screenshots if the issue reappears.
- It is advisable to keep the Endpoint Protector client updated to the latest version to mitigate potential compatibility issues with macOS updates.
