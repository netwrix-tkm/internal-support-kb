- **Case Number:** 427206
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrivatBank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** 3.0.4.1006

## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported that a user on MacOS 15.0 Darwin experienced significantly decreased internet speed after installing the latest version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client. Attempts to enable or disable the Intercept VPN traffic did not resolve the issue.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: MacOS 15.0 Darwin
- EPP Client Version: 3.0.4.1006
- Other VPN Client: Cisco VPN client installed on the user's machine.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reported low internet speed after installing the EPP client.
2. Logs and screenshots were collected and submitted for analysis.
3. The customer disabled the Intercept VPN traffic option, which resolved issues with Google Meet but did not improve internet speed.
4. The customer was advised to enable Intercept VPN traffic to check if the internet speed improved.
5. Additional logs were requested with the Intercept VPN enabled for further analysis.
6. A remote session was scheduled with the customer and the EPP development team to investigate both the internet speed issue and the Google Meet issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the internet speed issue was identified as a bug related to Apple's operating system, which affected the performance of the EPP client when the Intercept VPN was enabled. The customer faced a dilemma where enabling the Intercept VPN caused issues with Google Meet, while disabling it led to decreased internet speed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to enable the Intercept VPN traffic, which is the recommended workaround until a permanent fix is provided for the underlying Apple bug. The customer was informed that if the issue persists after enabling the Intercept VPN, they should follow up for further assistance.

## Notes
- The customer expressed frustration due to the lack of interim results while gathering logs.
- It is important to monitor the related ticket (#429094) regarding Google Meet issues, as resolving that may also address the internet speed problem.
- Future follow-ups should ensure that the customer is aware of the current status and any potential solutions being developed.
