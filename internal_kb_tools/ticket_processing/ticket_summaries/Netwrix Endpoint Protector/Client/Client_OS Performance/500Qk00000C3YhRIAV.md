- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alyeska Pipeline Service Company

## Problem Description
The customer reported high system memory consumption (1-50GB of RAM) by several Windows EPP agents, which was traced to file tracing on D and F drive partitions hosting a heavy read/write SCADA application. Attempts to exclude these drives globally from file tracing were unsuccessful, leading to excessive logging and memory usage.

## Environment Details
- Multiple Windows EPP agents
- Heavy read/write SCADA application installed on D drive with archives on F drive
- EPP server and Splunk server receiving excessive logs from affected hosts

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer created global file extension tracing exclusions, which reduced memory usage to 1-2GB but was still high compared to other hosts.
2. Customer disabled file tracing on the affected hosts as a temporary measure.
3. Support suggested whitelisting D: and F: drives by creating an allowlist in the EPP settings.
4. Customer added both D and F paths to the allowlist and re-enabled file tracing.
5. Memory usage was monitored after changes, showing a reduction to approximately 4.2GB per host.
6. Further suggestions included modifying trace direction to only outgoing and potentially removing file tracing for network shares.

## Root Cause
The high memory consumption was primarily due to the EPP agents logging excessive file operations on the D and F drives, which were heavily utilized by the SCADA application. The EPP system treated these drives similarly to removable drives, leading to increased logging and memory usage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding both D and F drive paths to the allowlist, which significantly reduced memory usage to under 40MB per host.
- Monitoring the system after changes confirmed that memory usage remained stable without spikes.
- The customer was advised to manage disk space on the EPP appliance due to previous excessive logging.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that file paths are correctly formatted in the allowlist (e.g., using both D:xxxxxxx and D:/xxxxxxxx formats).
- Regular monitoring of memory usage and disk space is recommended, especially after significant changes to logging configurations.
- The customer was informed about newer versions of the software (5.9.2.0 and 5.9.3.0) available for upgrade, which may include further optimizations.
