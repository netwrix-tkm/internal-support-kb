## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NFb3gIAD
- **Case Number:** 439714
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** VicCnS Co.,Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** SEUNGWOOK MA
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** Client 2.4.4.1, Server 5.9.4.1, OS Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when Data Protection Inspection (DPI) is enabled in an Ubuntu Linux environment, the content-aware protection (CAP) policy does not apply as expected. Specifically, the policy was set to block defined content (emails) when uploading documents via the Chrome web browser, but this blocking did not occur with DPI enabled.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.10 (initially reported), later tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
- **Kernel Version:** 6.11.0-19-generic (initially reported)
- **Client Version:** 2.4.3.1 (initially reported), later updated to 2.4.4.1
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Deployment:** On-premise

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer disabled DPI and confirmed that the CAP policy worked as expected when uploading a document containing an email to Chrome.
2. The customer enabled DPI again and attempted the same upload, which did not trigger the expected blocking.
3. The support engineer informed the customer that Ubuntu 24.10 is not supported and recommended using the latest LTS version (Ubuntu 24.04).
4. The customer tested the latest version (Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS) with the updated client (2.4.4.1) but encountered the same issue.
5. A remote session was proposed to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily attributed to the use of an unsupported interim version of Ubuntu (24.10), which may have caused compatibility issues with the Endpoint Protector client. Although the customer later tested with a supported LTS version (24.04), the underlying cause of the DPI not applying correctly was not definitively identified during the case.

## Solution
The customer was advised to use the supported LTS version of Ubuntu (24.04) along with the latest client version (2.4.4.1). However, since the issue persisted even after these changes, the ticket was closed with the understanding that the customer could reopen it later if needed.

## Notes
- **Important Warning:** Ensure that customers are using supported LTS versions of Ubuntu for optimal compatibility with Endpoint Protector.
- The customer was informed that they could reopen the ticket within 30 days if they needed further assistance.
