## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP (Endpoint Protector) agent on their machine stopped applying any block policies intermittently, allowing sensitive data transfers without restrictions. The agent appeared online in the console, and settings such as DPI and Intercept VPN Traffic were enabled.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on a Mac machine.
- The network extension was noted to turn off automatically at random times.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs and screenshots during the incident for analysis.
2. Confirmed that the EPP agent was online and settings were unchanged.
3. Provided a test build to the customer to keep the network extension enabled.
4. Instructed the customer to install the latest agent version.
5. Monitored the situation for further occurrences after the installation.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the network extension being disabled at random times, which led to the EPP agent not enforcing policies. This behavior was suspected to be linked to system updates or potential conflicts with other software.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a clean installation of the latest EPP agent. After the installation, the problem of policies not being applied was not reproduced, indicating that the new agent version addressed the underlying issue.

## Notes
- The customer should monitor the system for any future occurrences of the issue.
- It is recommended to keep the EPP agent updated to the latest version to mitigate similar issues.
- If the problem recurs, further investigation into potential conflicts with other applications or system settings may be necessary.
