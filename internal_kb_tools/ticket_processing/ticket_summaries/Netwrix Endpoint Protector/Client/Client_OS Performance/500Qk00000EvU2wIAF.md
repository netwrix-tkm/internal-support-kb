## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EvU2wIAF
- **Case Number:** 419072
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Manpreet Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The user reported an issue where they could access the main website and their demo page, but encountered an error stating "Page cannot be loaded" when attempting to access specific tabs on the demo page. Disabling Endpoint Protector (EPP) allowed the pages to load correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5930
- **Age:** 15.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified access to the main website and demo page.
2. Attempted to access tabs on the demo page, confirming the "Page cannot be loaded" error.
3. Disabled EPP, which resolved the loading issue.
4. Whitelisted the following URLs with wildcards:
   - `https://us.salesplanning.varicent.com/*`
   - `https://us.salesplanning.varicent.com/*`
5. Analyzed logs for any Content Threat Blocked events, but none were found.
6. Escalated the ticket for further analysis and updates.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Endpoint Protector blocking access to a necessary resource, specifically related to the AWS Cognito service, which was not whitelisted.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding `cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` to the whitelist, allowing the necessary resources to load properly on the demo page.

## Notes
- Ensure that any third-party services, such as AWS Cognito, are whitelisted when users report similar loading issues.
- Regularly review and update whitelists to prevent similar access issues in the future.
