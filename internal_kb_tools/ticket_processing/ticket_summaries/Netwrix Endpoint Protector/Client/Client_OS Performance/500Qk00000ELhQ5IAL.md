## Problem Description
Users in India were unable to access the DEV link for the MicroStrategy Library, while the same link was accessible from China and EC2 instances. The STG and PROD links were functioning correctly for users in India.

## Environment Details
- DEV Link: [https://mst-bi.dev.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/](https://mst-bi.dev.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/)
- STG Link: [https://mst-bi.staging.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/](https://mst-bi.staging.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/)
- PROD Link: [https://mst-bi.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/](https://mst-bi.zsservices.cn/MicroStrategyLibrary/)
- Zscaler and EPP configurations were tested during troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified access to the DEV link with Zscaler enabled and EPP disabled - link worked fine.
2. Verified access to the DEV link with EPP enabled and Zscaler disabled - link worked fine.
3. Collected logs from the userâ€™s machine while reproducing the issue.
4. Captured a screenshot of the PROD login window, which was not appearing for the DEV link.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified, as the problem could not be reproduced during troubleshooting. It was noted that the link worked under certain configurations of Zscaler and EPP.

## Solution
The issue was resolved without direct intervention from support, as the customer confirmed that the problem was not demonstrated again. The case was subsequently closed.

## Notes
- Ensure to check the configurations of Zscaler and EPP when similar access issues arise, as they may affect link accessibility.
- Document any changes in user environment or configurations that could lead to similar issues in the future.
