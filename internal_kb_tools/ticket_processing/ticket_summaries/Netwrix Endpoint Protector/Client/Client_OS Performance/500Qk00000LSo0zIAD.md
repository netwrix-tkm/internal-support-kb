- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Joby Aero, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Vatsal Gupta
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported significant performance issues on a device where the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was recently deployed. The employee expressed concerns that the performance degradation was directly related to the EPP installation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Affected Device:** Specific employee's device (details not provided)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Suggested the customer to reinstall the EPP client agent on the affected computer, as this was identified as a singular case.
2. Planned to provide another EPP client build for testing if the issue persisted after the reinstallation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the performance issue was not explicitly identified; however, it was determined that reinstalling the EPP client agent could potentially resolve the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by having the customer reinstall the EPP client agent on the affected device. After the reinstallation, the customer confirmed that the performance issues were no longer present.

## Notes
- This case was identified as a singular issue, indicating that it may not be a widespread problem with the EPP deployment.
- If similar performance issues arise in the future, consider recommending a client agent reinstallation as a first step.
- Monitor for any recurring issues post-reinstallation to determine if further action or a different client build is necessary.
