- **Case Number:** 442051
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MeasureOne
- **Contact Name:** Kunal Koshti
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client/OS Performance
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** EPP 6.2.3.1 with EPP Server 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
After importing a license from the cloud portal, all AWS workspaces for the client became unstable. Users were unable to log in, and temporary profiles were created, leading to data loss.

## Environment Details
- EPP Version: 6.2.3.1
- EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.0
- AWS environment with multiple workspaces affected.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely with the client to investigate the issue.
2. Verified that the issue occurred after the license import.
3. Attempted to log in to AWS workspaces with EPP installed, which resulted in error messages.
4. Checked and modified CAP policies, removing affected devices/users, but the issue persisted.
5. Disabled and enabled DPI and MTP scanning settings, restarting the machine each time, but the errors continued.
6. Ensured Stealthy DPI was enabled, but it did not resolve the issue.
7. Planned to upgrade the EPP server to version 5.9.4.1 and install EPP version 6.2.4.2000.
8. Instructed the client to take a snapshot of the EPP appliance before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by compatibility problems between the EPP server and the installed EPP client version after the license import. The existing versions were not functioning correctly, leading to user login issues and the creation of temporary profiles.

## Solution
1. Upgraded the EPP server from version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1.
2. Installed EPP version 6.2.4.2000 on one of the AWS instance machines.
3. Restarted the machine, which resolved the login issues, allowing users to access their accounts and applications normally.

## Notes
- Ensure that snapshots of the EPP appliance are taken before performing upgrades to allow for quick recovery if issues arise.
- Future installations of EPP should be tested on a single instance before widespread deployment to prevent similar issues across multiple workspaces.
