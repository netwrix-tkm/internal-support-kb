- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Canada Guaranty
- **Contact Name:** Parinkumar Patel

- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** EPP Client version 6.2.4.2, Server version 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where users were unable to print emails from the Microsoft Outlook application. When attempting to print, users received a DLP block pop-up stating, "The Print action was blocked for: Microsoft Outlook - Memo Style." The customer indicated that there were no existing policies in place that would block this type of printing.

## Environment Details
- Microsoft Outlook application
- Netwrix Endpoint Protector DLP Console version 5.9.4.1
- EPP Client version 6.2.4.2000 (initially)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided logs for review, specifically pointing to line 2509 in the logs for error details.
2. A remote session was conducted to check CAP logs and policies.
3. The customer was advised to upgrade to the latest EPP client version (6.2.4.2) and server version (5.9.4.1).
4. The customer added `outlook.exe` to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions in the DLP console as a temporary workaround.
5. The issue was escalated to the R&D team for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by a Content Aware Protection (CAP) policy that was not visible in the customer's policy list, which was blocking the print action from Outlook.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer upgraded to the latest EPP client version (6.2.4.2) and confirmed that the printing functionality from Outlook was restored. The upgrade addressed the underlying CAP policy issue that was causing the block.

## Notes
- Ensure that the latest versions of both the EPP client and server are installed to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist after upgrades, check for any hidden CAP policies that may be affecting functionality.
- Encourage customers to utilize the Advanced Scanning Exceptions feature for applications that require uninterrupted access, such as Outlook.
