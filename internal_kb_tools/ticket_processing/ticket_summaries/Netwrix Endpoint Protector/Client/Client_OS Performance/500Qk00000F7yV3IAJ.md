- **Case Number:** 419603

## Problem Description
The client reported an inability to connect back to the server, despite the Application Load Balancer (ALB) logs indicating that connections were allowed. The backend server was returning 400 error codes.

## Environment Details
- ALB logs indicated connections from the client IP (183.83.53.234) to the backend server IP (172.31.30.219) on port 443.
- The client was using EPPClient version 3.0.3.1009 on macOS 14.6.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed ALB access logs for connection attempts and error codes.
2. Identified 404 and 500 error responses from the backend server.
3. Escalated the issue to DevOps for deeper investigation.
4. Suggested checks for:
   - Corruption in the configuration file located at `/var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml`.
   - Custom Nginx configurations or ports.
   - Usage of custom certificates.
   - Status of "Increased Communication Security" setting.
5. Recommended regenerating the server certificate stack if communication issues persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the backend server not recognizing the client certificates sent by the EPPClient, leading to 500 internal server errors. Additionally, there were indications of misconfigurations in the server settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Ensuring that the configuration file was correct and not corrupted.
- Verifying that the Nginx configuration was properly set up to handle client certificates.
- Disabling the "Increased Communication Security" setting, which was causing additional complications.
- Regenerating the server certificate stack to ensure proper recognition of client certificates.

## Notes
- Changes to certificates typically require updates to the Nginx configuration file. Ensure that any custom configurations are preserved during updates.
- Always verify the status of security settings that may affect client-server communication.
- Regularly check and validate configuration files to prevent similar issues in the future.
