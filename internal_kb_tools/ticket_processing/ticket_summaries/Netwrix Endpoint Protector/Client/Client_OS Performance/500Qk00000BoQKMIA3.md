- **Case Number:** 411905
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cleerly
- **Contact Name:** Josh Luttrell
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client/OS Performance
- **Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Problem Description
After upgrading the MacOS client from version 2.8.4.2 to 2.9.0.7, five users on MacOS 14.5 were unable to connect to Bluetooth peripherals, despite the global policy allowing Bluetooth mice and keyboards remaining unchanged.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** MacOS 14.5
- **Previous Version:** 2.8.4.2
- **Upgraded Version:** 2.9.0.7
- **EPP Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server version being used (5.9.1.0).
2. Suggested disabling the Minifilter Driver in Device Control -> Global settings (not applicable for Mac).
3. Allowed "Bluetooth Other" devices in the Global Rights policy as a temporary workaround.
4. Investigated changes in how the EPP Mac agent classifies Bluetooth devices.

## Root Cause
A bug was identified in version 5.9.1.0 related to how the EPP Mac agent uses MacOS-specific Bluetooth APIs to detect device types, which caused Bluetooth peripherals to stop functioning after the upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by allowing "Bluetooth Other" devices in the Global Rights policy as a temporary workaround. A permanent fix was scheduled for release in version 5.9.4.0, which was confirmed by the support team.

## Notes
- Users should monitor the release notes for version 5.9.4.0 to ensure the fix is implemented.
- If the fix does not make it into version 5.9.4.0, it will automatically be included in version 5.9.5.0.
- It is advisable to keep the "Bluetooth Other" option enabled until the fix is confirmed to avoid disruption in Bluetooth connectivity.
