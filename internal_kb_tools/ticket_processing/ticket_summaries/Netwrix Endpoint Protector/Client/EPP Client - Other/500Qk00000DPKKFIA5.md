## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with third-party applications not functioning correctly after reinstalling the latest version of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client. Specifically, the software center client failed to start on the local machine, while the event log indicated errors related to the new EPP version. The applications were functioning properly with the previous version of the EPP client.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on several test machines running the latest EPP version.
- The customer was available for troubleshooting calls on Tuesday at 10:30 AM MST or Wednesday between 9-11 AM MST.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the event logs for error messages related to the software center client.
2. Confirmed that the applications were functioning correctly with the previous version of the EPP client.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue on additional test machines with the latest EPP version.
4. Discussed potential configurations and settings that could affect application performance with the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the new EPP version's scanning settings, which were interfering with the operation of certain third-party applications.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the process names of the affected applications to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list within the EPP client settings. This adjustment allowed the applications to function correctly without interference from the EPP scanning processes.

## Notes
- It is recommended to review and update the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list whenever a new version of the EPP client is installed, especially if third-party applications are affected.
- Future installations or updates of the EPP client should include a compatibility check with critical applications to prevent similar issues.
