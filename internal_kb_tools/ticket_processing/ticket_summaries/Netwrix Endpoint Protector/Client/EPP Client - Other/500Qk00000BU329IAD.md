## Problem Description
The customer reported that their environment had 6,000 licensed computers, while they should only have 4,000. They were unable to determine the source of the excess computers and noted that many computers with a "Last Seen" value of over a month were still showing as licensed despite being inactive.

## Environment Details
- The customer has a large number of computers that have not communicated with the server for over two months.
- The system settings should automatically unlicense inactive computers, but this was not occurring.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected information regarding the computers that were not being deleted from the system.
2. Engaged engineering to investigate the backend processes affecting computer licensing.
3. Suggested uninstalling agents from inactive computers to prevent erroneous reporting.
4. Provided commands to re-register computers in the backend:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM certificate;
   UPDATE license SET assigned_to = NULL;
   UPDATE clientmachine SET reregister = 1, trialversion = NULL WHERE deleted = 0;
   ```
5. Monitored the system to see if computers would still reappear after deletion.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a failure in the backend processes that allowed inactive computers to remain licensed. Specifically, the computers were not being unregistered correctly, and the agents were still installed on many of the inactive machines, allowing them to reappear in the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing a backend procedure provided by the server team, which involved re-registering the computers and ensuring that the licensing status was updated correctly. The customer confirmed that the issue was fixed and agreed to close the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that agents are uninstalled from decommissioned computers to prevent them from reappearing in the system.
- Regular monitoring of the "Last Seen" values and licensing status is recommended to maintain accurate records.
- Future cases should consider the impact of Active Directory (AD) synchronization on computer listings and licensing.
