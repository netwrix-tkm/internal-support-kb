## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with enabling Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on a Mac machine using Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The DPI feature was disabled temporarily while the issue was being investigated.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specific to one Mac machine within the customer's environment.
- The DPI feature was not functioning as expected, leading to its temporary disablement.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry sent to the customer for more details regarding the DPI issue.

4. Further communication was exchanged to gather additional information about the certificate installation and trust settings.
5. Instructions were provided to ensure the certificate was set to "Always Trust" in the Mac's security settings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the DPI certificate not being trusted by the Mac operating system. This lack of trust prevented the DPI feature from functioning correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to:
1. Download and install the DPI certificate on the Mac machine.
2. Open the certificate in the Keychain Access application.
3. Set the certificate to "Always Trust" under the Trust settings.
Once these steps were followed, the DPI feature began to function correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that any certificates required for DPI are properly installed and trusted on Mac machines to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify the trust settings of certificates after installation, especially when deploying security features like DPI.
