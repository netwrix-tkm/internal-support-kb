## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message stating: "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCP140.dll was not found." This issue was encountered while using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client.

## Environment Details

- Regularly check for updates to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector and associated dependencies to maintain compatibility and functionality.
