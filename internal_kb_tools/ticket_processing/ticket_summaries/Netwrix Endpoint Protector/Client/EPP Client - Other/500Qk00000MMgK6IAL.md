## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MMgK6IAL
- **Case Number:** 437187
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 6.2.3.3001 (latest packaged version)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that some clients were generating logs with timestamps set in the future (e.g., "Date/Time (Client): 2055-02-27 07:20:21"). This issue was affecting multiple clients, and the logs could not be collected as the problem was not consistently reproducible.

## Environment Details
- Affected clients were running the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue was sporadic, with correct timestamps following the erroneous entries.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to confirm the local time settings on the affected computers.
2. Suggested enabling debug logs on the clients where the issue was observed.
3. Advised the customer to check the Windows Event Viewer for any anomalies regarding date and time changes.
4. Collected registry settings related to time zone information from affected clients.
5. Investigated potential causes related to incorrect synchronization with RTC or NTP servers.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as local time changes on the affected computers. The logs with future timestamps were generated when the system time was altered, either manually or due to synchronization issues.

## Solution
The customer confirmed that upon checking the system events on the affected computers, they found that the local time was being changed. Further analysis was to be conducted on their side to ensure proper time synchronization. The ticket was closed after confirming that the issue was not reproducible on the Netwrix side.

## Notes
- It is important for clients to maintain accurate system time settings to prevent similar issues.
- Future occurrences of this issue may require checking the Windows Event Viewer logs for any time synchronization errors.
- If clients are using different regional settings (e.g., Thai), it may affect how dates are displayed and logged.
