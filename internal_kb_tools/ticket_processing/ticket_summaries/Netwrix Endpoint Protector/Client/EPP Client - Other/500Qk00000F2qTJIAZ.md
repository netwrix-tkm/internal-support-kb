## Problem Description
The customer reported that three device exceptions set on the server were not being reflected on the client side, despite updating policies and restarting the computer.

## Environment Details
- The issue may not be reproducible on the latest server version.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that three device exceptions were set on the server.
2. Updated policies on the server.
3. Restarted the client computer to apply changes.
4. Suggested updating the console to version 5.9.4.0 and testing with the latest agent.
5. Monitored the situation to see if the issue persisted after updates.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not explicitly identified; however, it was suggested that the issue might be related to an outdated agent version on the client side.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating to the latest agent version, which appeared to eliminate the problem of exceptions not populating on the client.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always ensure that both the server and client are running the latest versions of the software to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the issue reoccurs, the customer should refer back to this ticket for context and further troubleshooting steps.
