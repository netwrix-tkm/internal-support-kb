## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H9GiGIAV
- **Case Number:** 424220
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Martin-Baker
- **Contact Name:** Conor Lane
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that one of their endpoints was showing as offline in Endpoint Protector, despite being online and accessible from their network. This issue prevented the assignment of access to new USB devices and the application of updated policies.

## Environment Details
- The affected device identifier is `mb14012`.
- The device is part of a different team located at another site, limiting physical access for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Restarted the affected device.
2. Uninstalled and reinstalled Endpoint Protector version 6.2.3.1.
3. Attempted to sync all policies.
4. Captured logs using Wireshark and shared them with support.
5. Checked network and firewall configurations with the networking team.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by a third-party application (firewall) blocking the connection between the endpoint and the Endpoint Protector server. Specifically, there were issues with the firewall settings that prevented proper communication.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the firewall settings to allow inbound and outbound traffic on ports 443 and 80 for the Endpoint Protector server IP. The customer was advised to whitelist both the domain `h6i313b.hosted.endpointprotector.com` and the IP address `3.9.47.175` to ensure proper connectivity.

## Notes
- Ensure that firewall rules are correctly configured to allow traffic for Endpoint Protector to function properly.
- Regularly check for any changes in network configurations that may affect connectivity.
- If issues persist, consider capturing additional logs and reviewing them for any anomalies.
