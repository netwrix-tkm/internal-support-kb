## Problem Description
The customer reported an error occurring on one of their lab computers when executing the magician command after the installation of the DLP client. They requested assistance in resolving this issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered on a lab computer running the Netwrix Endpoint Protector with the DLP client installed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs generated during the execution of the magician command.
2. Attempted to execute the magician command without the DLP client installed to isolate the issue.
3. Checked for any known compatibility issues between the magician tool and the DLP client.
4. Included the magician tool in the Advanced Scanning exception settings.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by the DLP client interfering with the magician command execution, likely due to the DLP clientâ€™s scanning processes conflicting with the magician tool's operations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by including the magician tool in the Advanced Scanning exception settings of the DLP client. This adjustment allowed the magician command to execute without interference from the DLP client.

## Notes
- Ensure that any critical applications or tools are added to the Advanced Scanning exceptions when using the DLP client to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for updates or patches for both the DLP client and the magician tool to maintain compatibility and functionality.
