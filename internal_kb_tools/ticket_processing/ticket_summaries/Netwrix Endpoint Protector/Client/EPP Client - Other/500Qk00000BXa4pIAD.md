## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BXa4pIAD
- **Case Number:** 411287
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sitetracker
- **Contact Name:** Franklin Pavon
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** EPP Server version 5.9.3.0, Client versions 2.9.0.7 and 3.0.1.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP client on MacOS devices was not allowing external storage devices to be seen or read after entering a one-time passcode (OTP) to approve them.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server version: 5.9.3.0
- EPP Client versions tested: 2.9.0.7 and 3.0.1.2
- Operating System: MacOS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the EPP server and client versions in use.
2. Attempted to access external drives after entering the OTP, but the drives remained in a grey status and were not detected by the laptop.
3. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.
4. Investigated potential conflicts with the Mobile Device Management (MDM) tool, Mosyle.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a setting in the MDM tool, Mosyle, which was blocking external media from being mounted on the MacOS devices.

## Solution
The setting in Mosyle that blocked external media was disabled, allowing the external drives to be recognized and accessed by the EPP client. It was noted that while the client worked without full disk access, enabling it would likely improve performance and functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure that the MDM settings do not block external media access when deploying EPP clients.
- Full disk access should be enabled for optimal performance, although the client can function without it.
- For future cases, verify MDM configurations if similar issues arise with external device access.
