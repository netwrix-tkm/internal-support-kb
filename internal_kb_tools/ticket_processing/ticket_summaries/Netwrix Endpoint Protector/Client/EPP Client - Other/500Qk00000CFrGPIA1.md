## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CFrGPIA1
- **Case Number:** 412864
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Schwing Stetter India Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Muthamil Selvan M
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** Tamper Mode
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP agent service intermittently stops despite tamper mode being enabled, allowing the service to be stopped manually.

## Environment Details
- The customer has approximately 1800 endpoints in their environment.
- Affected endpoints have both Falcon and Versa agents installed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs using the EPPSupportTool as per the provided instructions.
2. Reviewed event logs for errors related to the EPP service.
3. Confirmed the presence of Falcon and Versa agents on affected endpoints.
4. Inquired about the number of affected computers and any other security applications installed.
5. Suggested uninstalling the Falcon and Versa agents to test if the issue persists.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as not being consistently reproducible across all endpoints. It was determined that only a small number of endpoints were affected, and the problem did not appear to be directly related to the tamper mode functionality itself.

## Solution
The issue resolved itself after a period of monitoring, with the customer reporting that the problematic endpoints had been functioning without issues for the past 30 days. It was noted that tamper mode was working as expected even with both the CrowdStrike and Versa agents installed.

## Notes
- The issue does not consistently replicate across all endpoints with the agents installed.
- It is recommended to monitor the affected endpoints and gather logs if the issue reoccurs.
- Ensure that the latest version of the EPP agent is installed to mitigate potential issues.
