- **Case Number:** 433452
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BD Software Distribution Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Ratnesh Awasthi
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
A Windows endpoint system in the client environment was not reflecting on the EPP Server console. Despite multiple attempts to reinstall the EPP client, the system remained unregistered and unable to establish a connection with the server.

## Environment Details
- The client had deployed 7 endpoints successfully, but the 8th Windows endpoint was experiencing connectivity issues.
- The endpoints were configured to send TCP traffic over port 446, which the customer was rerouting over port 443 to reach the EPP Server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Uninstalled the existing EPP client, ensuring logs and database were removed.
2. Rebooted the affected system.
3. Reinstalled the EPP client.
4. Collected logs from both the functioning and non-functioning computers for comparison.
5. Investigated potential network issues or conflicts with other software (e.g., firewall or antivirus settings).

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be related to either a network configuration problem or a conflict with another product in the client's environment. The logs indicated that the affected computer was unable to make contact with the EPP server, but the configurations for the EPP clients were identical across all machines.

## Solution
After thorough troubleshooting and analysis, it was concluded that the issue was not with the EPP client or server but rather with the client's network or security settings. The logs were submitted to the R&D team for further analysis, and the client was advised to check firewall and antivirus configurations that might be blocking the connection.

## Notes
- Ensure that all endpoint configurations are identical and that there are no discrepancies in firewall or antivirus settings.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking network routes and configurations, especially if traffic is being rerouted.
- After closing a ticket, it can be reopened within 30 days for any updates; otherwise, a new ticket must be created.
