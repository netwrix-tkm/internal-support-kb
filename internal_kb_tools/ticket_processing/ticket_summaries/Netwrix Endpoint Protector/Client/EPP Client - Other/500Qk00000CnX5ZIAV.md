## Problem Description
After applying a hotfix, none of the agents were able to communicate with the server, even after a reinstall.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: macOS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the operating system in use (macOS).
2. Attempted to reinstall the agents on the affected machines.
3. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.
4. Modified the server's IP address on the client machines.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the agents being unable to connect to the server due to an incorrect or outdated server IP address configured on the client machines.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by modifying the server's IP address on the client machines to the correct address, allowing the agents to successfully communicate with the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that the server IP address is correctly configured on all client machines after applying updates or hotfixes.
- Regularly verify connectivity between agents and the server, especially after system changes.
