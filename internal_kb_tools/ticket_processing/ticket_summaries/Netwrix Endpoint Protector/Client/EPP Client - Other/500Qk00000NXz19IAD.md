- **Case Number:** 440575
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Samsung - SRI Bangalore
- **Contact Name:** Mohammed Shafi
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2000 (Client), 5.9.4.0 (Server)

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error occurring in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) when attempting to run code, which they believed was caused by the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client.

## Environment Details
- EPP Client Version: 6.2.3.1
- EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.0
- The problematic machine had no CAP policies assigned, DPI completely disabled, and MTP scanning disabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely with the client to investigate the issue.
2. Checked CAP policies and computer settings; confirmed no CAP policies were assigned.
3. Disabled DPI and MTP scanning on the client machine.
4. Uninstalled the EPP client and confirmed that the code ran successfully in VS Code.
5. Advised the client to upgrade to the latest EPP Server (5.9.4.2) and EPP Client (6.2.4.2).
6. After the upgrade, the issue persisted, prompting further investigation.
7. Enabled DPI and stealthy DPI; the error continued.
8. Compared settings with another machine where the issue did not occur, noting that MTP scanning and metadata were enabled there.
9. Enabled MTP scanning and metadata on the problematic machine, but the error persisted.
10. Checked the `eppclient.log` for settings; confirmed `hooking.enable` was set to 1.
11. Added `VSCode.exe` to Advanced Scanning Exceptions but the error remained.
12. Conducted multiple remote sessions to troubleshoot further, including attempts to gather logs and perform modifications.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the EPP client interfering with the execution of code in VS Code. The configuration settings, particularly the Advanced Scanning Exceptions and the MTP scanning settings, were not correctly set, which contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after:
1. Upgrading the EPP Server to version 5.9.4.2 and the EPP Client to version 6.2.4.2000.
2. Ensuring that `VSCode.exe` was correctly added to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions.
3. Disabling MTP scanning on the problematic device, which had previously caused conflicts.

## Notes
- Ensure that any executable files that need to be excluded from scanning are added with their full names (e.g., `VSCode.exe` instead of just `VSCode`).
- Monitor for similar issues on other machines after updates to the EPP client or server, as configurations may vary.
- Maintain clear communication with the client during remote sessions to ensure all necessary modifications are made with their consent.
