- **Account/Company:** NHS Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Southampton
- **Contact Name:** Dave Andrews
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The client reported that a custom device control user remediation policy was created and assigned to a test laptop, which is a member of the designated group. Despite selecting the custom User Remediation Notification Template within the group settings, the client workstation continued to receive the default notification instead of the custom one.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 5940
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the test laptop was indeed a member of the assigned group.
2. Checked the group settings to confirm that the custom User Remediation Notification Template was selected.
3. Reviewed other settings within the group to ensure they were applying correctly to the workstation.
4. Attempted to reassign the custom policy to the test laptop to see if it would take effect.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was determined that the custom notification template was not being applied correctly due to a configuration oversight.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by Adrian Draghici, who likely corrected the configuration settings related to the custom User Remediation Notification Template. The specific steps taken to resolve the issue were not documented, but the resolution involved ensuring that the custom template was properly assigned and recognized by the client workstation.

## Notes
- Ensure that any custom templates are correctly configured and assigned to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document the exact steps taken to resolve such issues for future reference and to assist other technicians in similar cases.
