- **Case Number:** 417921
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Booking.com
- **Contact Name:** Henrique Praxedes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that in the upcoming version of macOS (Sequoia), Apple is implementing stricter user notifications for applications that monitor or connect to wireless/Bluetooth devices. This change could lead to users frequently clicking 'Don't allow' on generic error popups from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) application. The customer requested information on how EPP is addressing this issue and a list of potential notifications users might encounter.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** macOS Sequoia
- **Application:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Engaged with the QA team to test the new macOS version (Sequoia).
2. Investigated the notifications triggered by the EPP agent when enumerating printer devices.
3. Confirmed with Apple that there is no API or MDM method available to suppress the notification popups.
4. Reviewed the code to identify how the popups are triggered and discussed potential solutions with the development team.

## Root Cause
The pop-up notifications are triggered by the EPP agent when it attempts to enumerate printer devices. Apple has stated that there is no way to automatically allow or disallow these local network privacy prompts, and they cannot be suppressed through MDM methods.

## Solution
The issue was addressed by confirming that the pop-up notifications are a result of Apple's new privacy measures in macOS Sequoia. The development team is working on providing clearer messaging within the EPP application to inform users about the actions being taken, rather than displaying generic error messages. Additionally, it was noted that the issue may have been resolved in the 15.1 Beta version of macOS.

## Notes
- Users should be informed that the pop-up notifications are a result of Apple's privacy changes and are not specific to the EPP application.
- It is recommended to keep the EPP application updated to benefit from any improvements or changes made in response to Apple's updates.
- Monitor future updates from Apple regarding any changes to the notification handling in macOS.
