## Problem Description
A user encountered the error code `SEC_ERROR_REUSED_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL` while attempting to access Google.com on Firefox, resulting in a "Secure Connection Failed" message. The issue did not occur in other browsers, and access was restored after uninstalling the EPP client.

## Environment Details
- **Browser:** Firefox
- **Operating System:** Mac (specific version not provided)
- **EPP Client:** Installed and later uninstalled

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared the browser cache.
2. Attempted to access the site in an incognito window.
3. Restarted the Mac.
4. Used the keyboard shortcut `cmd+shift+r` to refresh the page.
5. Enabled and disabled proxy settings.
6. Deleted certificates from the browser's certificate store.
7. Disabled the option to "Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates."
8. Uninstalled the EPP client, which resolved the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict with the EPP client, which was likely causing Firefox to mismanage the SSL certificates, leading to the `SEC_ERROR_REUSED_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL` error.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Deleted the problematic certificate from the Firefox authorities tab.
2. Re-applied the certificate to restore proper functionality.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that SSL certificates are correctly managed within the browser, especially when using security software like the EPP client.
- Users experiencing similar issues should first check for conflicts with security software before attempting extensive troubleshooting steps.
- Future users should be advised to check the browser's certificate store for any reused or conflicting certificates if they encounter similar SSL errors.
