- **Account/Company:** Mordor Intelligence Pvt. Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** mohammad.azam Azam
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Mac Endpoint client software was installed successfully on a Mac laptop, but all websites, including Gmail, remained accessible and needed to be blocked.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Mac
- **Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the Mac Endpoint client software.
2. Checked the configuration settings related to website blocking.
3. Investigated the injection of the EPP certificate in the Safari browser.
4. Enabled the option "Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications."

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the EPP certificate not being injected into the Safari browser, which allowed unrestricted access to websites.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by enabling the "Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications" option, which allowed the EPP certificate to be injected correctly into Safari, thereby enforcing the website blocking policy.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP certificate is properly injected into all browsers to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the configuration settings after updates to the Endpoint Protector software to maintain website blocking functionality.
