- **Case Number:** 423540
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that some users were unable to upload files to SharePoint, with the upload process hanging indefinitely at the 'uploading' stage. Additionally, some users could not update files online in SharePoint.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **DLP Policy:** Customer requested a review of their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the DLP policy settings to identify any restrictions that might affect file uploads.
2. Verified user permissions for SharePoint to ensure they had the necessary access rights.
3. Checked for any network issues that could be causing delays in file uploads.
4. Confirmed that the issue was not related to DPI (Data Processing Interference) as per customer confirmation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was confirmed that the problem was not related to the DLP policy or DPI settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after confirming that the DLP policy was not the cause of the upload failures. Further investigation into user permissions and network settings may be necessary for future occurrences, but no specific changes were made to the DLP policy or system settings that directly resolved the issue.

## Notes
- It is important to verify user permissions and network connectivity when users experience issues with file uploads to SharePoint.
- Future cases should consider checking for any recent changes in user roles or network configurations that may impact file upload capabilities.
- Maintain communication with the customer to ensure that any underlying issues are addressed promptly.
