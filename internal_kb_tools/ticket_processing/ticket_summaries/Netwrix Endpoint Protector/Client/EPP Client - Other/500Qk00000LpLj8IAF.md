## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LpLj8IAF
- **Case Number:** 435699
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after installing the EPP Client on RHEL 9.4, the Endpoint Protector Notifier was closed, and there was no EPP icon visible in the system tray to perform a Policy Update. Additionally, the Endpoint Protector Notifier did not provide an option for Policy Update.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: RHEL 9.4
- EPP Client installed but not functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the EPP Client on RHEL 9.4.
2. Checked for the presence of the EPP icon in the system tray after closing the Endpoint Protector Notifier.
3. Attempted to reinstall the EPP Client to see if the icon would appear.
4. Escalated the issue to engineering for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation of the GNOME Desktop Environment that comes with RHEL. Unlike other desktop environments, GNOME does not include a system tray by default, which prevents the EPP icon from being displayed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the absence of the EPP icon in the system tray is a known limitation of the GNOME Desktop Environment. The customer was advised to use alternative methods for policy updates, such as using command-line options or configuring the EPP Client to run in a different desktop environment that supports system tray icons.

## Notes
- Customers using RHEL with the GNOME Desktop Environment should be made aware of this limitation when installing the EPP Client.
- Consider recommending alternative desktop environments that support system tray functionality for a better user experience with the EPP Client.
