- **Case Number:** 413737
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Governikus KG
- **Contact Name:** Jan Mohr
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Fedora 40 EPP client

## Problem Description
The customer, Jan Mohr from Governikus KG, reported the need for a client compatible with Fedora 40. They were advised in a previous support ticket to submit a feature request for this requirement.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Fedora 40
- **Product Version:** EPP Client version 2.4.3.1007

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer acknowledged the request and confirmed it would be forwarded to the engineering team.
2. A feature request was raised internally regarding the need for a Fedora 40 client.
3. The support engineer communicated with the customer to confirm if closing the ticket was acceptable while the request was being processed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the absence of a compatible client for Fedora 40 in the existing product offerings of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by raising a feature request internally for the development of a Fedora 40 client. The customer was provided with a link to download the Fedora 40 EPP client:
```
https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_fedora_40_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz
```
The support engineer confirmed that the request would be monitored and the customer would be notified upon any updates.

## Notes
- It is important to keep track of feature requests and communicate updates to customers to maintain transparency.
- Future requests for clients on new operating systems should be documented and escalated to the engineering team promptly to ensure timely development and support.
