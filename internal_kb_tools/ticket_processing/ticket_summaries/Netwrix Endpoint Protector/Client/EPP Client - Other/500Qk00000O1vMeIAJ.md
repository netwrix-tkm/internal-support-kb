## Problem Description
The customer reported significant slowness when accessing certain domains (e.g., atlassian) on Mac endpoints after installing Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EEP). Load times exceeded 30 seconds, while removing EEP resulted in load times dropping to 4-6 seconds.

## Environment Details
- Affected Platform: Mac OS
- Number of URLs in URL deny list: Approximately 1000
- Presence of duplicates in the deny list

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer tested the issue across different operating systems, confirming it was isolated to Mac.
2. A remote session was scheduled to investigate the issue further.
3. The customer was advised to review the URL deny list for duplicates and unnecessary entries.
4. A set of logs was to be collected from the affected machines during the issue occurrence.

## Root Cause
The slowness was identified as being caused by an excessive number of URLs in the URL deny list, which included duplicates and unnecessary entries.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to:
- Review and clean up the URL deny list to remove duplicates and unnecessary URLs.
- Monitor the performance after making these adjustments to ensure that load times improved.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to maintain an optimized URL deny list to prevent performance issues.
- Future cases should consider the impact of large deny lists on application performance, especially on specific operating systems like Mac.
