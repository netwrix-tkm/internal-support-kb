## Problem Description
The customer, LAUSD IT Security, inquired about two main issues regarding eDiscovery scans: 
1. The factors affecting the speed of eDiscovery scans.
2. The possibility of scanning for specific file types related to Microsoft Internet Information Services, .NET application development files, and Microsoft SQL files.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically the eDiscovery feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Responded to the customer's first question regarding scan speed, clarifying that it is dependent on the computer's resources.
2. Addressed the second question by informing the customer about the use of a Denylist File Name dictionary to include additional file types in eDiscovery scans.

## Root Cause
The speed of eDiscovery scans is influenced by the resources available on the scanning device rather than server conditions or other external factors.

## Solution
The customer's questions were resolved by:
- Confirming that eDiscovery scan speed is dependent on the computer's resources.
- Providing guidance on how to create a Denylist File Name dictionary to include specific file types in eDiscovery scans, with a reference to the relevant documentation for further assistance.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that the performance of eDiscovery scans can vary significantly based on the hardware capabilities of the device being used.
- Users should utilize the Denylist File Name dictionary feature to customize their scanning capabilities for specific file types not included by default in the eDiscovery settings.
