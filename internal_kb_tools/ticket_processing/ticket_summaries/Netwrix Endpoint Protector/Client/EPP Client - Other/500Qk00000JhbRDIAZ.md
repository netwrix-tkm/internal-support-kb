## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with pushing a VPN profile through Jamf to all office Mac machines. The error message received was: "The ‘VPN Service’ payload could not be installed. The VPN service could not be created." Despite following the guidelines provided in the Netwrix documentation, the issue persisted.

## Environment Details
- Affected platform: Mac machines in an office environment.
- Management tool: Jamf for device management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the VPN profile configuration against the provided documentation.
2. Attempted to reinstall the VPN profile multiple times.
3. Checked for any existing VPN services that might conflict with the new installation.
4. Reviewed Jamf logs for any additional error messages or warnings related to the VPN profile installation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict with existing VPN services on the Mac machines, which prevented the new VPN service from being created.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing any conflicting VPN services from the affected Mac machines. After ensuring that no other VPN services were present, the VPN profile was successfully pushed through Jamf without any errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that all existing VPN services are removed before attempting to install a new VPN profile to avoid conflicts.
- It is advisable to check Jamf logs for any error messages that may provide insight into installation issues.
- Future installations should be tested on a single machine before rolling out to all devices to identify potential conflicts early.
