## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O6q9RIAR
- **Case Number:** 442233
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WTEX Fintech Private Limited (KreditPe)
- **Contact Name:** Sujith Nair
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** DPI Bypass Options
- **Version:** 3.0.4.1006 (MAC)

## Problem Description
The customer reported errors while accessing multiple URLs, including some Google documents, through the application via terminal (curl). The URLs were not blocked on Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP), yet access was denied.

## Environment Details
- **Client Version:** 3.0.4.1006
- **Operating System:** MAC
- **EPP Hosting Platform:** Uncertain, believed to be on GCP or AWS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to whitelist the URLs in the allowlist but access issues persisted.
2. Technical support requested additional details about the issue, including screenshots and logs.
3. Support suggested checking the Reports & Analysis section in the EPP UI for logs related to the blockage.
4. Support recommended verifying if the allowlist was added to the CAP policy.
5. Customer was advised to check the "Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications" setting in the EPP UI.
6. Customer disabled DPI bypass options as a last resort, which resolved the access issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) settings in the EPP client, which were interfering with the access to certain URLs. The DPI bypass options were enabled, leading to the blockage of legitimate traffic.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the DPI bypass options in the EPP settings. After this change, the customer confirmed that access to the previously blocked URLs was restored.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the impact of disabling DPI settings, as this may affect security measures.
- Future cases involving URL access issues should consider checking DPI settings and bypass options as a potential cause.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the implications of modifying DPI settings on their security posture.
