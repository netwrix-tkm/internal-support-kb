## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ljw5NIAR
- **Case Number:** 435386
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, RubyPlay, requested a method to check if the macOS EPP (Endpoint Protector) Network extension is enabled or disabled on their endpoints. They were aware that EPP could take action if the Network extension was disabled but wanted visibility on which macOS computers had the extension not allowed.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** macOS
- **Product Version:** Not specified

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for checking the status of the EPP Network extension.
2. Confirmed that the EPP has functionality to act if the Network extension is disabled.
3. Provided the customer with a command to check the status of the Network extension.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for a straightforward method to verify the status of the EPP Network extension on macOS endpoints, which was not readily available in the current EPP functionality.

## Solution
The customer was advised to run the following command in the terminal to check the status of the EPP Network extension:
```bash
systemextensionsctl list
```
This command lists all Network/System extensions, and for Endpoint Protector, it will indicate "activated" and "enabled" when the extension is installed and enabled.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the command `systemextensionsctl list` for checking the status of Network/System extensions on macOS.
- It may be beneficial to consider adding a feature in future EPP updates that provides a more user-friendly interface for checking the status of extensions.
