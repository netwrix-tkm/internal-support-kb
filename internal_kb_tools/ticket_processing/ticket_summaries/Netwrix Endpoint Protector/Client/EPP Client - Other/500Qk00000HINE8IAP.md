## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with Bluetooth devices and peripherals being disabled, which was suspected to be related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client after a server upgrade.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed after a server upgrade.
- The customer was using an older version of the EPP client prior to the resolution.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to replicate the issue after the server upgrade.
2. Communicated with the customer to schedule a time for testing the latest EPP client.
3. Collected logs from the affected machine to analyze the Bluetooth issue.
4. Investigated the Bluetooth driver status in Device Manager, noting errors when EPP was active.
5. Recommended the installation of the latest EPP client version (5941 agent) to the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the Bluetooth issues was identified as a potential conflict between the older EPP client and the Bluetooth driver, which was exacerbated by the recent server upgrade. The logs indicated that the Bluetooth driver was not functioning correctly when the EPP client was active.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by installing the latest EPP client (version 5941 agent). After the installation, the Bluetooth devices were re-enabled and functioned correctly without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are using the latest version of the EPP client to avoid similar conflicts with device drivers.
- Recommend regular updates and testing after server upgrades to identify potential issues early.
- Monitor the status of Bluetooth devices in Device Manager when troubleshooting similar issues, as driver errors can provide critical insights.
