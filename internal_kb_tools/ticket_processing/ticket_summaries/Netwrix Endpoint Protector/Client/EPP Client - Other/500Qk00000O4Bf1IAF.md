## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O4Bf1IAF
- **Case Number:** 442061
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** G&W Legal
- **Contact Name:** Pankaj Pandit
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** Stealthy DPI Driver
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a website was not accessible after it had been whitelisted in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on an endpoint machine where Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) was enabled, but the Stealthy DPI Driver was not activated.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue.
2. Verified that the required website was whitelisted in both Allowlist and URL Categories.
3. Discovered that while the website was partially accessible, other pages were not loading.
4. Checked the DPI settings and found that the Stealthy DPI Driver was not enabled.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the Stealthy DPI Driver, which enhances the functionality of Deep Packet Inspection, was not turned on. This caused interference with the loading of certain web pages on the affected endpoint machine.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling the "Stealthy DPI Driver" for the affected endpoint machine. This was done through the following steps:
1. Navigated to **Device Control** > **Computers** > **Manage Settings** > **DPI Configuration**.
2. Enabled the "Stealthy DPI Driver".
3. After enabling this feature, web browsing resumed as expected.

For a global setting, the Stealthy DPI Driver can also be enabled under **Device Control** > **Global Settings** > **Manage Settings** > **DPI Configuration**.

## Notes
- The Stealthy DPI Driver is particularly important when third-party software such as antivirus or VPNs are installed, as it helps to eliminate application interference.
- It is recommended to ensure that the Stealthy DPI Driver is enabled on all relevant machines to prevent similar issues in the future.
