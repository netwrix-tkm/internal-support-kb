- **Case Number:** 438972
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nexpert AG
- **Contact Name:** Harald Holst
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that there was no connection between the client and the Azure server, resulting in the property tab displaying only limited server information and preventing any rule updates.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client.
- The customer was using multiple computers, but the specific environment details (OS, network configuration) were not provided.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested confirmation on whether the issue was occurring on one or multiple computers.
2. The customer was asked to check if the affected computers could ping the server's IP address.
3. The support engineer instructed the customer to verify the number of available licenses in the System Configuration under System Licensing and to provide a screenshot.
4. The customer was guided to check the EPP client settings to confirm if it was communicating with the server by using a specific key combination to display server connection details.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a lack of available licenses due to old computer accounts still being present in the system, which consumed the available licenses.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the customer deleting old computer accounts that were no longer in use, thereby freeing up licenses. This allowed the client to successfully connect to the Azure server and perform rule updates.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly review and remove old or unused computer accounts to ensure that sufficient licenses are available for active devices.
- Future troubleshooting should include checking license availability as a primary step when clients report connectivity issues with the server.
