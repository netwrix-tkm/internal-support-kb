## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the behavior of the policy interval refresh rate in relation to the Active Directory sync. They observed a discrepancy between the configured policy interval refresh rate (600 seconds) and the Active Directory sync schedule (every 6 hours), as the policy received time on the computer did not align with either setting.

## Environment Details
- Policy interval refresh rate configured to 600 seconds (10 minutes).
- Active Directory sync scheduled to occur every 6 hours.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's configuration settings for policy interval refresh and Active Directory sync.
2. Confirmed with the customer that the policy interval refresh rate and Active Directory sync are not related.
3. Clarified whether disabling the Active Directory sync would affect the policy interval refresh rate.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the discrepancy was not identified. However, it was confirmed that the policy interval refresh rate and the Active Directory sync operate independently of each other.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the policy interval refresh rate and the Active Directory sync are not related. This clarification addressed the customer's concerns regarding the timing of policy updates.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that the policy interval refresh and Active Directory sync are independent processes.
- Future inquiries regarding synchronization issues should include a review of both settings to ensure clarity on their operational relationship.
