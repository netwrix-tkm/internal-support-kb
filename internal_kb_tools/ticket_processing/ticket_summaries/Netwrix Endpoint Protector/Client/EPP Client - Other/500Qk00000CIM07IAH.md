## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue when attempting to open the application "FirmaEc" (electronic signature application), which resulted in an error message stating, "Network issues, unable to connect." The application functioned normally when the relevant policy was disabled.

## Environment Details

- Application: FirmaEc (electronic signature application)
