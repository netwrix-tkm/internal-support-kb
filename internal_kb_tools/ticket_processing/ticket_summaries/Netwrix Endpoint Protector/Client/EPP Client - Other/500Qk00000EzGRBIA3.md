- **Case Number:** 419249
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Naukri
- **Contact Name:** Vaneet Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Ubuntu 22

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Ubuntu 22 agents were experiencing an issue where Indian phone numbers transferred via [dlptest.com](https://dlptest.com) were not being intercepted and blocked by the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system, despite other types of data being successfully blocked on the same site.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22
- DLP System: Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- Specific Issue: Indian phone numbers not blocked on dlptest.com

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed logs provided by the customer, specifically the file named "Test_Phone."
2. Confirmed that other websites (e.g., Gmail) were successfully blocking the same file types.
3. Suggested checking the "Max File Size for Shadowing (KB)" setting in Device Control -> Global Settings.
4. Recommended creating new files for testing file shadowing, as only one shadow is generated per file.
5. Offered to conduct a remote session to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the EPP Client's configuration, which was not effectively capturing Indian phone numbers on the specified website.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating the EPP Client, which allowed the system to properly intercept and block Indian phone numbers on dlptest.com.

## Notes
- Ensure that the "Max File Size for Shadowing" setting is appropriately configured to capture larger files if necessary.
- Be aware that only one shadow file is generated per unique file; re-uploading the same file will not create a new shadow.
- Future testing should involve creating new files to ensure accurate results in file shadowing scenarios.
