- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I9G6PIAV
- **Case Number:** 426634
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nexus
- **Contact Name:** Matt Morrison
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1010

## Problem Description
After upgrading to EPP version 6.2.3.1010, the customer reported an inability to print from Outlook, despite print queues showing as active in the EPP client. Other applications and OWA were unaffected.

## Environment Details
- Previous EPP version: 6.2.2.1006
- EPP Client status: Print queues indicated as green ticks

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the print queues were active in the EPP client.
2. Suggested adding the "Outlook" process to the whitelisted applications under "System Parameters" > "Advanced Scanning Exceptions".
3. Instructed to enable "Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning".
4. Advised adding "Outlook" to the "Application Process Name" and confirming it was added successfully.
5. Recommended updating policies on the endpoint machine and restarting Outlook.
6. Suggested performing server and computer restarts when the issue persisted.
7. Conducted a remote session to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The upgrade to EPP version 6.2.3.1010 inadvertently activated a feature that required a CAP module license, which the customer did not possess. This caused the printing functionality in Outlook to be blocked.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deactivating the MTP (Multi-Transport Protocol) for the customer, allowing printing from Outlook to function correctly. The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved after testing on multiple machines.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the licensing requirements for features that may be activated during upgrades.
- It is advisable to check for any new settings or features introduced in updates that may affect existing functionalities.
