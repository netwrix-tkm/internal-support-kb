- **Case Number:** 410916
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IT Webster Limited
- **Contact Name:** Support IT Webster
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer, AB Concept, reported that after updating their EPP server firmware to version 5.9.3.0, they were unable to utilize the new features "Re-read rights and settings for all computers" and "Re-read client devices for all computers."

## Environment Details
- **Firmware Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the firmware version of the EPP server.
2. Reviewed the functionality of the new features in the context of the updated firmware.
3. Provided guidance on how to access and utilize the new features.
4. Explained the purpose of the buttons related to verifying communication between the client and server.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a malfunction but rather a misunderstanding of the new features' functionality. The buttons for "Re-read rights and settings" and "Re-read client devices" were intended as an additional method to verify that the latest rights and settings were communicated, which was already being handled by the refresh time interval setting.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that the new features were functioning as intended. The technical support team explained that the settings could be found in the Device Control menu under Global Settings, and that the communication verification was already being managed by existing settings.

## Notes
- It is important to educate customers on the functionality of new features, especially when they may overlap with existing processes.
- Future support interactions should include a review of the settings and features introduced in firmware updates to prevent similar misunderstandings.
