## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FfM9AIAV
- **Case Number:** 420809
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP macOS client stopped communicating with the server during a remote session. Initially, the client was functioning correctly, but after a configuration change, it lost connectivity.

## Environment Details
- **Server Location:** On-premises in Singapore
- **Client Location:** macOS machine in Indonesia
- **Network Configuration:** VPN connection to the internal network

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the initial communication between the EPP client and the server.
2. Checked the browser for certificate errors, which indicated "invalid cert date or certificate expired," despite the certificate being valid until 2029.
3. Disabled Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on the client.
4. Restarted the macOS machine.
5. Checked the connection status using `Ctrl+Alt+i`, which showed "NO" for communication.
6. Confirmed that the web console was accessible from the same machine and that the EPP server IP was reachable via ping.
7. Verified that the IP and port settings were correct.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the communication issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was noted that disabling DPI and restarting the machine may have contributed to the loss of connectivity.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by re-establishing the connection settings and ensuring that the client was properly configured to communicate with the server. Further monitoring was suggested to ensure stability.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the connection status after making changes to network configurations, such as disabling DPI.
- If similar certificate errors occur, verify the certificate validity and check for any network-related issues that may affect communication.
- Future troubleshooting should include checking firewall settings and VPN configurations, as these can impact client-server communication.
