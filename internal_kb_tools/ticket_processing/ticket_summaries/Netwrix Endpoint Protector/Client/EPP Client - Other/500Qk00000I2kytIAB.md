## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the availability of an Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) client for Chromebook computers.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry was made regarding the compatibility of the EPP client with Chromebook OS.

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Communicated the findings to the customer, stating that an EPP client is not available for Chromebook OS.
4. Offered to create a feature request for the EPP client if the customer provided details about the specific Chromebook OS.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that there is currently no EPP client available for Chromebook OS. The customer was given the option to create a feature request for future consideration, but they declined at this time.

## Notes
- It is important to note that while there is no current support for Chromebook OS, customers may express interest in such features in the future. Keeping track of these requests can help prioritize development efforts.
- Future inquiries regarding EPP client availability for non-supported platforms should be handled similarly, confirming the lack of support and offering to document feature requests if applicable.
