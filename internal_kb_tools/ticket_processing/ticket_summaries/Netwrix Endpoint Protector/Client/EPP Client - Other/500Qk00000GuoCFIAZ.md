## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported that two users experienced screen blinking issues on macOS 14.7 endpoints during their workday. The problem seemed to improve after the EPP client was deleted, leading the customer to suspect a potential link between the EPP client and the screen blinking.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 14.7
- **EPP Client Version:** 5.9.4.0 (latest available)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the EPP client version installed on the affected machines.
2. Inquired if other customers had reported similar issues.
3. Suggested scheduling a meeting with the customer to reproduce the issue and collect logs.
4. Monitored the situation after the EPP client was removed to see if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the screen blinking issue was not definitively identified. However, the symptoms improved significantly after the EPP client was deleted, suggesting a potential conflict or issue with the EPP client on the macOS endpoints.

## Solution
The issue could not be reproduced after the EPP client was removed, and the customer reported that the screen blinking had ceased. Therefore, the ticket was closed as resolved without further action required.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor similar cases for any recurring issues related to the EPP client on macOS systems.
- If similar reports arise, gathering logs from the affected endpoints may help in diagnosing the issue more effectively.
- Customers should be advised to keep their EPP client updated to the latest version to minimize potential conflicts.
