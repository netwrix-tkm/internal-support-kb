## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BpeI2IAJ
- **Case Number:** 411944
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 6.2.3.0023

## Problem Description
The customer reported that formatting a USB stick using Rufus fails when the Endpoint Protector (EPP) is installed. The issue is resolved by uninstalling EPP.

## Environment Details
- EPP Agent Versions involved:
  - Version 5.9.5.3
  - Version 6.2.3.0023
- Tool used: Rufus v4.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by attempting to format the USB stick with Rufus while EPP was installed.
2. Uninstalled EPP, which allowed Rufus to format the USB stick successfully.
3. Suggested setting "Unknown Device" to "Allow Access" in EPP settings to see if it resolves the issue without uninstalling EPP.
4. Confirmed that the "Unknown Device" category was blocking access to the volume created by Rufus.

## Root Cause
The EPP Agent was blocking access to the volume created by Rufus because it was categorized as an "Unknown Device." This prevented Rufus from formatting the USB stick as it required access to the blocked volume.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to set the "Unknown Device" category to "Allow Access" in the EPP settings. This allowed Rufus to access the necessary volume and complete the formatting process successfully.

## Notes
- The "Unknown Device" category does not generate logs or user remediation prompts, which can lead to confusion regarding blocked devices.
- It is recommended to document the setting changes in the operation manual for future reference.
- Users should be cautious when allowing access to "Unknown Devices" as it may expose the system to potential risks.
