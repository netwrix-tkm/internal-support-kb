- **Case Number:** 415560
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AutoFi
- **Contact Name:** Jayme Villafranca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
Multiple users reported receiving pop-up messages stating "Scanning file: /var/tmp/epp/*.png" while drafting emails in Gmail. The file path indicated a connection to Endpoint Protector, but no corresponding .png files were found in the specified directory.

## Environment Details
- Users were experiencing the issue on devices with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Client installed.
- The issue persisted despite attempts to uninstall and reinstall the EPP Client.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Users reported the pop-up messages when drafting emails.
2. Verified the absence of .png files in the directory `/var/tmp/epp/`.
3. Attempted a clean uninstall and reinstall of the EPP Client on affected devices.
4. Reviewed EPP content-aware logs for any related entries, but found no relevant information.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the MIME type and OCR scan settings within the Endpoint Protector configuration, which caused the pop-up messages to appear erroneously.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the MIME type and OCR scan settings within the Endpoint Protector configuration. This change eliminated the unnecessary pop-up messages for users while drafting emails.

## Notes
- Ensure that MIME type and OCR scan settings are correctly configured in Endpoint Protector to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for updates or patches for the EPP Client that may address known issues or improve functionality.
