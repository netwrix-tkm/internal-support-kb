## Problem Description
The customer was migrating from an on-prem solution to a new SaaS environment hosted by Netwrix. After running an IP Change script on two test Mac machines, the machines appeared online and licensed but were not connecting to the server. The logs indicated a registration loop with a certificate read error.

## Environment Details
- Migration from on-prem to SaaS environment.
- Test conducted on Mac machines using JAMF.
- FQDN of the server was used for the IP Change script.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed logs which indicated a registration loop and certificate read errors.
2. Escalated the issue to the server team for further investigation.
3. Suggested verifying server settings, including certificate types and Nginx configuration.
4. Attempted to regenerate the server certificate stack using the command:
   ```bash
   /opt/functions.sh run regenerateCertsV2Callable 3502
   ```
5. Restarted the Nginx service.
6. Confirmed that ports 443 and 80 were open.

## Root Cause
The issue was traced back to a problem with the server's certificate stack, likely caused by an inconsistency in the database imported from the on-prem environment.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by regenerating the server certificate stack using the specified command. This action corrected the registration loop and allowed the machines to connect to the server successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that any database imported from an on-prem environment is thoroughly checked for inconsistencies that could affect server operations.
- Always verify that the server's certificate settings are correctly configured before running migration scripts.
- If similar issues arise, consider regenerating the server certificate stack as a first troubleshooting step.
