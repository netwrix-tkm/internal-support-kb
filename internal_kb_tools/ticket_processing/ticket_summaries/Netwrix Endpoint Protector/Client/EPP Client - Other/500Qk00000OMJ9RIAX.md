## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OMJ9RIAX
- **Case Number:** 442882
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cyberspace
- **Contact Name:** Sumit Kaushik
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** Content Aware Protection
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The client requested that users should be able to access and browse specific websites, but file uploads to those websites must be restricted or blocked.

## Environment Details
- The domains in question were added to the Deep Packet Inspection Allowed list.
- The issue was reproducible by removing the website from the Denylist, which allowed users to upload files.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the client to gather information about the issue.
2. Confirmed that the domains were added to the Deep Packet Inspection Allowed list.
3. Scheduled a remote session for further investigation.
4. Conducted a remote session where the URL categories were removed from the Content Aware Protection (CAP) policy.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the configuration of the Content Aware Protection policy, which was not effectively enforcing restrictions on domains that were added to the Allowed list.

## Solution
During the remote session, the solution involved removing the URL categories from the CAP policy. This change allowed the desired restrictions on file uploads to be enforced while still permitting access to the websites.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any domains requiring upload restrictions are not added to the Allowed list in the Deep Packet Inspection settings.
- Future cases should verify the configuration of the CAP policy to ensure it aligns with the client's requirements for access and upload restrictions.
