## Problem Description
The customer reported that personal Gmail accounts were accessible on approximately 32 Mac devices, despite organizational policies prohibiting such access.

## Environment Details
- Affected devices: 32 Mac devices
- Specific OS version mentioned: Mac OS Monterey (on one device)
- VPN and EPP settings were involved in the troubleshooting process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely with the client to assess the issue.
2. Verified that the intercept VPN was enabled and the Repeat VPN notification was selected.
3. Checked full disk access, accessibility, and Bluetooth access for the EPP, confirming all permissions were granted.
4. Reinstalled the EPP and restarted the devices, which did not resolve the issue.
5. Collected debug logs for further analysis.
6. Reviewed logs and identified that the network extension required user approval.
7. Confirmed that no CAP policies were assigned to the affected devices.
8. Assigned a CAP policy to the devices and updated the policy.
9. Tested the configuration on multiple devices to ensure Gmail access was blocked.
10. Assisted with an additional device running an older OS version, enabling third-party app permissions for EPP.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was the lack of assigned CAP policies on the affected devices. Without these policies, the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features for blocking personal Gmail accounts were not activated. Additionally, the network extension was not enabled on some devices.

## Solution
1. Assigned the necessary CAP policies to the affected devices.
2. Enabled the network extension on the Mac devices.
3. Verified that the configuration successfully blocked access to personal Gmail accounts on the tested devices.

## Notes
- Ensure that all devices have CAP policies assigned to activate DLP features.
- Users with admin credentials may disable network extensions; this should be managed at the organizational level.
- Regularly check and update EPP settings to maintain compliance with organizational policies.
