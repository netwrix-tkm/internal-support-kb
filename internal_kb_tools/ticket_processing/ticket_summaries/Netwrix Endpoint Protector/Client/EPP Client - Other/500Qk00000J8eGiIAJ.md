## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J8eGiIAJ
- **Case Number:** 428997
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AVL Tippelmann GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Detlef Janik
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 5941

## Problem Description
The customer reported that approximately half of the clients were not communicating with the server and were showing as unlicensed. The issue arose after a previous problem with certificates, and attempts to update policies on the clients were unsuccessful.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5941

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the client status and communication with the server.
2. Attempted to "Update Policies now" on the affected clients, noting that the tray icon did not blink.
3. Checked the settings tab of the client for client name, user name, and administrator contact information.
4. Explored options to fix the issue without reinstalling the client.
5. Identified that a complete uninstall with the option to remove all components was necessary.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Client Registration Certificate being enabled by mistake, which prevented the clients from properly communicating with the server.

## Solution
The resolution involved providing the customer with the ZAP tool, which allowed for the complete uninstallation of the agents that were not communicating. After using the tool, the clients could be reinstalled correctly, restoring communication with the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Client Registration Certificate is configured correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- When clients show as unlicensed and fail to communicate, consider using the ZAP tool for a thorough uninstallation before reinstalling the client.
