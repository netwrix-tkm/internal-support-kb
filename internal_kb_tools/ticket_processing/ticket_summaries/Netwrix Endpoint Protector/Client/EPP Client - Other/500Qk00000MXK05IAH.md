## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MXK05IAH
- **Case Number:** 437628
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International
- **Contact Name:** Csilla Torok
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) tool could monitor or block specific types of file transfer scenarios, including:
1. Uploading files using the `curl` command.
2. Transfers through a custom file server using SOCKS5.
3. RDP channels.
4. SSH tunnels.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry pertains to the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector in monitoring and blocking various file transfer methods.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request regarding the monitoring/blocking capabilities of EPP for specified transfer scenarios.
2. Consulted with the engineering team to gather detailed responses for each transfer type.
3. Communicated findings back to the customer regarding the capabilities of EPP.

## Root Cause
The inquiry stemmed from the customer's need to understand the limitations and capabilities of the EPP tool concerning specific file transfer methods. The engineering team clarified that while some methods could be monitored, others could not.

## Solution
The following responses were provided to the customer based on the engineering team's feedback:
1. **Curl Command:** Yes, EPP can monitor this using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and by monitoring the `curl` application.
2. **Custom File Server (SOCKS5):** Monitoring may be possible by checking the port of the SOCKS5 proxy using DPI. The customer was advised to enable custom ports in the Content Aware Protection settings.
3. **RDP Channels:** No, EPP does not support monitoring/blocking RDP channels.
4. **SSH Tunnels:** No, EPP does not support monitoring/blocking SSH tunnels.

Additionally, it was clarified that while the SSH option is enabled in EPP, it does not support SSH tunnels specifically.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that while EPP can monitor certain transfer methods, it has limitations regarding RDP and SSH tunnels.
- For SOCKS5 monitoring, the customer must ensure that the appropriate ports are configured in the EPP settings.
- Future inquiries regarding specific transfer capabilities should be directed to the engineering team for accurate information.
