## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GJF3mIAH
- **Case Number:** 422249
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arista Networks, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Bharani M
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 2.4.04_v2.4.3.1007

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a user on Ubuntu 24 experienced significant delays (5-10 minutes) when attempting to shut down or reboot the system while running the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24
- **Client Version:** 2.4.04_v2.4.3.1007

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to check logs for any errors related to the EPP client.
2. The support team requested the customer to run specific commands to generate logs:
   - Switch to superuser: `$ sudo su`
   - Navigate to the log directory: `$ cd /var/log/epp-client/`
   - Create a new log file: `$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log`
   - Restart the EPP client daemon: `$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart`
   - Reproduce the shutdown/reboot issue.
   - Copy the generated log file to the desktop: `$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log /home/user/Desktop/`
3. The customer provided the requested logs for further analysis.
4. The support team escalated the issue internally for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the shutdown delay was identified as a configuration setting in the EPP client service, specifically the timeout setting for shutdown operations.

## Solution
The customer discovered a workaround by manually editing the EPP client service configuration. The following change was made:
- Changed the timeout setting from `TimeoutSec=5min` to `TimeoutSec=30sec` in the service file using the command:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl edit --full epp-client-daemon.service
  ```
This adjustment allowed the system to shut down in approximately 30 seconds instead of the previous 5-10 minutes.

## Notes
- It is recommended to update the installation package to reflect the new timeout setting to prevent similar issues for future installations.
- While the workaround effectively resolved the immediate issue, further investigation into the underlying cause is suggested to ensure a permanent fix is implemented in future updates.
