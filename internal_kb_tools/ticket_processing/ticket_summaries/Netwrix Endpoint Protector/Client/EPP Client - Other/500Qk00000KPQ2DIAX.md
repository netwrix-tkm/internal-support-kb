## Problem Description
The customer reported that new clients were not appearing in the computer overview of their system, preventing them from enabling or disabling devices on those clients.

## Environment Details
The issue was reproduced in the customer's environment, indicating that it was not an isolated incident.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that new clients were not appearing in the computer overview.
2. Attempted to communicate with the affected clients to check their status.
3. Suggested uninstalling the client software to see if it would resolve the communication issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that uninstalling the client with specific options cleared the certificate settings, which may have contributed to the communication failure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to uninstall the client software on the affected computers with the "Remove database and Logs" option selected. This action cleared the certificate settings, allowing the clients to communicate properly with the system afterward.

## Notes
- Ensure that when uninstalling the client, the "Remove database and Logs" option is selected to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the system after reinstallation to confirm that clients appear correctly in the computer overview.
