## Problem Description
The customer requested an offline patch for Hotfix #1 that includes fixed EPPClients to address Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities. The existing hotfix did not contain the necessary client updates, making it difficult for engineers to deploy the fixes manually across a large number of clients (1,000 to 10,000).

## Environment Details
- The customer operates in a closed network environment, which complicates remote support and patch deployment.
- The urgency was heightened due to potential government scrutiny regarding the vulnerability.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer initially received an offline patch for Hotfix #1 but found it did not include the fixed EPPClients.
2. The customer communicated the urgency of the situation and requested a new patch that would allow for automatic deployment of the fixed EPPClients.
3. The support team confirmed that the EPPClients were separate from the server-side patch and did not have an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for a combined patch.
4. The support team provided links to the fixed EPPClients for manual download and deployment.
5. After further communication, a new offline patch containing the fixed EPPClients was created and shared with the customer.

## Root Cause
The initial offline patch for Hotfix #1 did not include the updated EPPClients, which was necessary for addressing the reported vulnerabilities. This oversight led to difficulties in deploying the fix across a large number of clients.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing a new offline patch that included the fixed EPPClients. The support team communicated the availability of the new patch and provided direct download links for the EPPClients for various operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux).

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that all necessary components, including client updates, are included in future patches to avoid similar deployment issues.
- Customers operating in closed network environments may require additional support and clear communication regarding patch availability and deployment strategies.
