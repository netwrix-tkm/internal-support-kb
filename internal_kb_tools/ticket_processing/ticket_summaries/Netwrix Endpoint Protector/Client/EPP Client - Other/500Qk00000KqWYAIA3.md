## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KqWYAIA3
- **Case Number:** 432877
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stradata AML
- **Contact Name:** Juan Otero
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** MacOS Sequoia 15.2 (24C101)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when Kaspersky Endpoint Security is active, Netwrix Endpoint Protector (NEP) is unable to block access to personal Gmail accounts on MacOS. However, NEP functions correctly when Kaspersky Endpoint Security is disabled. The same configurations work as expected on Windows and Linux operating systems with Kaspersky Endpoint Security enabled.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** MacOS Sequoia 15.2 (24C101)
- **Security Software:** Kaspersky Endpoint Security

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that NEP is functioning correctly when Kaspersky Endpoint Security is turned off.
2. Confirmed that the same configurations work on Windows and Linux with Kaspersky Endpoint Security enabled.
3. Requested additional details from the customer and scheduled a meeting to collect EPP Client logs for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem between the Kaspersky Endpoint Security and the Netwrix Endpoint Protector on MacOS, which prevented the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature from functioning correctly.

## Solution
The resolution involved providing the customer with a newer version of the EPP Client that addressed the compatibility issue with Kaspersky Endpoint Security. This update allowed NEP to function as intended while Kaspersky Endpoint Security was active.

## Notes
- Ensure to keep the EPP Client updated to avoid similar compatibility issues in the future.
- Monitor the interaction between security software and NEP, especially on MacOS, as issues may arise with specific versions or configurations.
