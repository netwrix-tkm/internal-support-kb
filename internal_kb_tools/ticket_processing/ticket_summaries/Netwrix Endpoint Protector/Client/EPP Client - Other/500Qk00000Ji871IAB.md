## Problem Description
The customer reported that clients on one of their servers had gradually stopped checking in without any clear explanation. The last check-in for many clients was noted on 2024-09-18, typically occurring in the morning, suggesting a potential issue that began on that date.

## Environment Details
- The issue affected approximately 30 PCs at the site.
- The customer was cautious about updating to a newer client version due to pending documentation updates regarding icon/name changes.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Performed a fresh install of the client on the technician's own computer, which worked fine.
2. Attempted a fresh install on a userâ€™s computer that reported a USB device being blocked, but the issue persisted.
3. Ran the zapper tool across all affected PCs to attempt to reset the client installations.
4. Used asset management software to confirm that the client was reinstalled via Group Policy Object (GPO).
5. Deleted records of old decommissioned computers to rule out licensing issues, despite having auto-release enabled.
6. Deleted records of many computers that had stopped checking in to see if they would reappear.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a communication issue on the customer's side, which was preventing the clients from checking in with the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer allowed the client-server communication on their side, enabling the clients to check in successfully again.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that client-server communication is not inadvertently blocked by network settings or firewall rules.
- Future updates to client versions should be accompanied by timely documentation updates to avoid confusion among users.
