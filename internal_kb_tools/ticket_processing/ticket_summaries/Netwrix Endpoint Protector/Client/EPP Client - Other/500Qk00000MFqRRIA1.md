- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Blue Halo
- **Contact Name:** Justin Yackoski
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** EPP for USB device control

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP (Endpoint Protector) Outlook plugin was causing Outlook to load slowly. They were not using DLP (Data Loss Prevention) and did not have a license for it, only utilizing EPP for USB device control. The customer requested guidance on disabling the EPP plugin from Outlook.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector solely for USB device control.
- The issue was specifically related to the EPP Outlook plugin installation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Explained to the customer how the Outlook Add-on is installed along with the EPP agent.
2. Informed the customer that the Outlook Add-on can be disabled or removed from the Outlook settings.
3. Provided the `msiexec` command with parameters to skip the installation of the Outlook add-on.

## Root Cause
The EPP Outlook plugin was automatically installed with the EPP agent, which was not needed for the customer's use case, leading to performance issues in Outlook.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer on how to disable or remove the EPP Outlook plugin through Outlook settings. Additionally, the customer was provided with a command to prevent the installation of the Outlook add-on in future installations.

## Notes
- Customers using EPP solely for USB device control may not require the Outlook plugin, and it can be disabled to improve Outlook performance.
- It is advisable to communicate the installation behavior of the EPP agent to customers to prevent similar issues in the future.
