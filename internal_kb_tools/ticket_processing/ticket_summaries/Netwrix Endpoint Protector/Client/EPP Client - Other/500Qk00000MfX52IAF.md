- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Payroc Financial Services
- **Contact Name:** David Edwards
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** Content Aware Policy
- **Version:** 6.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a Content Aware Policy created to block specific domains in the Domain Block List was not functioning as expected when applied to web browsers.

## Environment Details
- The policy was specifically intended to block the domain `www.netflix.com`.
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed the creation of a Content Aware Policy and its application to web browsers.
2. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
3. During the remote session, various settings were reviewed, including the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the DPI settings, specifically the rejection of the DPI certificate by third-party applications, which prevented the Content Aware Policy from functioning correctly.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following action was taken during the remote session:
- **Enabled Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications.** This adjustment allowed the Content Aware Policy to function as intended, successfully blocking the specified domains.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI settings are correctly configured when implementing Content Aware Policies to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document any third-party applications that could interfere with DPI operations to streamline troubleshooting for future cases.
