## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IC4a9IAD
- **Case Number:** 426753
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Marco Vinicius Aguemi Cabral
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (pending patch)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was blocking WinSCP for domains that were supposed to be exempted. Despite the domains being added to the allowlist, file transfers using WinSCP were still being blocked.

## Environment Details
- The customer uses a script to transfer multiple files simultaneously.
- File transfers are conducted through a network share that is included in the allowlist.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected diagnostic data from the device, but logs were not informative.
2. Reviewed the configuration of the EPP client and the allowlist settings.
3. Conducted a remote session to apply the allowlist again.
4. Upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.3.1 and reapplied the allowlist.
5. Engaged the R&D team to analyze logs and configurations.
6. Suggested testing without the WinSCP exit point enabled and with policy action set to report only.

## Root Cause
The root cause identified was that WinSCP was monitored under the Content Aware Protection (CAP) policy. As a result, the network share whitelist did not apply to file transfers initiated through monitored applications like WinSCP. The EPP client was correctly receiving the list of excluded network shares, but the policy settings were preventing the transfers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the network share paths were correctly added to the allowlist. The customer was advised to wait for an offline patch for version 5.9.4.1, which would potentially address the issue. The customer was also instructed to test the configuration after the upgrade and to reopen the ticket if the issue persisted.

## Notes
- Ensure that monitored applications are not included in the network share whitelist to prevent unintended blocking of file transfers.
- Future troubleshooting should include verifying the CAP policy settings and ensuring that the correct logs are collected during the reproduction of the issue.
- The customer has been advised to monitor the situation after the patch is applied and to report any further issues.
