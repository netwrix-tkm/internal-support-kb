## Problem Description
The customer reported that two SanDisk Extreme Portable SSB External USB drives (models SDSSDE60-1TOO and SDSSDE61-2TOO) were not recognized by the system and would not mount as read-only or at all.

## Environment Details
- Test machine: MACFVFDV5QMQ05P
- The customer attempted to use EasyLock on devices with multiple partitions, which is not supported.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the USB drives were not recognized by the test machine.
2. Tested an old Samsung USB drive, which mounted successfully as read-only after being formatted to exFAT, indicating that the issue was not with the client machine.
3. Consulted with a colleague (Arpitha) regarding the recognition of certain devices by Endpoint Protector (EPP).

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation of the EasyLock feature, which does not support deployment on storage devices with multiple partitions.

## Solution
The resolution involved confirming that EasyLock cannot be deployed on devices with multiple partitions. The customer was informed of this limitation, and a workaround was requested.

## Notes
- Future users should be aware that EasyLock is incompatible with storage devices that have multiple partitions.
- It is advisable to test USB devices for compatibility with EPP before deployment, especially when using features like EasyLock.
