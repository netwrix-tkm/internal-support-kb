## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000PBoRLIA1
- **Case Number:** 445237
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Om Bankar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The user reported an issue where they were unable to upload a file to [docusign.upload.com](https://docusign.upload.com). The upload process was stuck, and the browser kept buffering. No block logs were visible in the EPP console, and the issue was temporarily resolved when the EPP suspension OTP was provided.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Issue Type:** Incorrect configuration

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the file upload was getting stuck without any block logs in the EPP console.
2. Tested the upload functionality after providing the EPP suspension OTP, which allowed the upload to complete successfully.
3. Planned a remote session to investigate further and collect logs, scheduled for 15.05.2025.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a probable misconfiguration within the EPP Client that led to the blocking of the file upload without generating any block logs.

## Solution
The issue resolved itself without further intervention. It is believed that the misconfiguration was corrected automatically, allowing the file upload to proceed normally.

## Notes
- No block logs were generated during the incident, which may indicate a need for improved logging or alerting mechanisms in future configurations.
- For similar cases, it may be beneficial to check for misconfigurations in the EPP settings that could lead to unexpected behavior, especially when no logs are available to diagnose the issue.
