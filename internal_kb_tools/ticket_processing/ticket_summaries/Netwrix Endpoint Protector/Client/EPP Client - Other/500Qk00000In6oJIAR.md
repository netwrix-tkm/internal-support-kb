## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system was blocking access to a data store on a storage server set up for Windows and Mac office PCs.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved a storage server configured for both Windows and Mac systems.
- The DLP system in use was Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** The support engineer, Andrei Pop, asked if the EPP client was installed on the storage server and whether any CAP (Content Awareness Policies) were applied.
2. **Remote Connection:** A remote session was scheduled to investigate the settings further.
3. **Settings Adjustment:** During the remote session, adjustments were made to the group settings related to the DLP policies.
4. **Testing:** The customer was instructed to test the changes after the adjustments were made.

## Root Cause
The DLP settings were incorrectly configured, which led to the blocking of legitimate data store access on the storage server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adjusting the DLP settings during a remote session to allow access to the data store.
- Ensuring that the EPP client was properly configured on the storage server.

## Notes
- It is important to verify that the EPP client is installed on all relevant servers and that CAP policies are correctly applied to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to test DLP settings after any adjustments to ensure that legitimate access is not inadvertently blocked.
