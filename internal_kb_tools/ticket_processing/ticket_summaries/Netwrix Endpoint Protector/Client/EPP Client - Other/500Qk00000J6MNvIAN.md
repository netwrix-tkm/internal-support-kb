- **Feature:** Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading to the latest version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (version 5940), certain applications were being blocked from running. This behavior was unexpected, as the customer had not encountered this issue in the years they had been using the product.

## Environment Details
- The customer is utilizing Netwrix Endpoint Protector primarily for monitoring and blocking printing (DLP for printing).
- The issue arose specifically after the server upgrade to version 5940.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer added the blocked applications to the "Advanced Scanning Exceptions" whitelist to allow them to run.
2. The customer inquired about the possibility of turning off Device Control policies, suspecting they might be the cause of the application blocking.
3. The support team recommended updating the EPP client agents to resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the upgrade to version 5940 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which introduced changes that inadvertently blocked certain applications from running.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating the EPP client agents. This update allowed the previously blocked applications to run without the need for manual whitelisting.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor application behavior after any major updates to the Endpoint Protector to identify potential blocking issues early.
- Customers should be informed that changes in policy settings, such as Device Control, can impact application functionality and should be reviewed if similar issues arise in the future.
