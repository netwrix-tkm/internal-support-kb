## Problem Description
The customer reported that multiple machines were showing as Offline in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system. They were unable to determine the cause of the issue or how to bring the machines back Online. The customer also mentioned a potential visualization bug in the Device Control interface that complicated troubleshooting.

## Environment Details
- The affected machines had the Netwrix agent installed and were showing updated times on the agent.
- The customer attempted to delete a computer that was showing as Online, which did not resolve the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer deleted a computer from Device Control > Computers to see if it would reappear Online after a reboot.
2. The customer confirmed that changes made for the Offline machines to access devices were ineffective.
3. The customer attempted to use One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for access, which did not work.
4. The support team scheduled a remote connection to investigate further.

## Root Cause
The computers were showing as Offline because they were not assigned to a license within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system.

## Solution
The support team released the necessary licenses for the affected computers, which allowed them to come back Online successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all devices are properly assigned licenses to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The visualization bug mentioned by the customer may require further investigation to improve the clarity of device status in the Device Control interface.
