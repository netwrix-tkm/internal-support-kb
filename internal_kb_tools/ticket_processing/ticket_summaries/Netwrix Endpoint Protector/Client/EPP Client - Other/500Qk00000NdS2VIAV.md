## Problem Description
The customer reported that several virtual machines (VMs) were unable to connect to the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server, requiring urgent resolution.

## Environment Details
- The affected VMs were running Windows 10.
- The EPP client version in use was 6.2.4.2, which is not compatible with the Windows 10 build being used.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to reinstall the EPP agent on the affected VMs.
2. The customer restarted the server hosting the VMs.
3. The support team requested additional information regarding the impact of the issue, the number of affected VMs, and the client/server versions.
4. The support team informed the customer that support for certain Windows versions had been discontinued and recommended using an earlier client version (6.2.3.1) for compatibility.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the incompatibility of the EPP client version 6.2.4.2 with the Windows 10 operating system being used on the affected VMs. The client version was not supported on the specific build of Windows 10.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by installing the EPP agent version 6.2.3.1 on all affected devices. This version was compatible with the Windows 10 build in use, allowing the VMs to successfully connect to the EPP server.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the EPP client version is compatible with the operating system version in use to avoid connectivity issues.
- For future reference, if encountering similar issues with Windows 10, consider using the 6.2.3.1 client version as a potential solution.
- Customers using unsupported operating systems should be advised to upgrade to a supported version to maintain compatibility with the latest EPP clients.
