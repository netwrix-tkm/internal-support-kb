## Problem Description
The customer, BMW Group AG, inquired whether the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Agent utilizes NTLM (v1 and v2) for communication or user verification, as they are planning to disable these protocols.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Client:** Endpoint Protector Agent

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's inquiry regarding the use of NTLM protocols.
2. Escalated the ticket for further investigation.
3. Confirmed with the development team regarding the authentication methods used by the Endpoint Protector Agent.
4. Noted that NTLM is not used for communication or user verification.

## Root Cause
The inquiry was based on the customer's plan to disable NTLM protocols. The Endpoint Protector Agent does not utilize NTLM for its operations, which alleviated the customer's concerns.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that the Endpoint Protector Agent does not use NTLM (v1 or v2) for communication or user verification. Instead, it employs OS system calls for functionalities such as FileShadows (e.g., SMBv2).

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly that the Endpoint Protector Agent does not rely on NTLM, which can help customers who are transitioning away from these protocols.
- Future inquiries regarding protocol usage should be directed to the development team for accurate information.
