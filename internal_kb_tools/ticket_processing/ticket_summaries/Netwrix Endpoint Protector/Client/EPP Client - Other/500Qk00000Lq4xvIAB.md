- **Case Number:** 435718
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cyberspace Security Solutions Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Pankaj Pandit
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** URL Categories

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the website [https://indiankanoon.org/](https://indiankanoon.org/) was not opening despite being whitelisted in the allowlist. The customer provided specific entries that were added to the allowlist but still encountered a DLP (Data Loss Prevention) error.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **DLP Error:** Attached screenshot showing the error (not included in this summary).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the website was added to the allowlist with the following entries:
   - `*.indiankanoon.org`
   - `*.indiankanoon.com`
2. Checked the CAP report log for any blocked threads.
3. Confirmed whether the Intercept VPN was active.
4. Ensured that certificate validation was enabled for all three marks.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the initial configuration of the allowlist not being correctly applied or recognized by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, leading to the DLP error when attempting to access the website.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the following website details were correctly added to the allowed URL list in the “URL Categories” under Denylists and Allowlists:
- `*.indiankanoon.org`
- `*.indiankanoon.com`

After confirming these entries were correctly configured, the website became accessible without triggering the DLP error.

## Notes
- Ensure that any new websites added to the allowlist are verified for correct syntax and placement within the URL Categories.
- Regularly check the CAP report logs for any blocked threads that may indicate misconfigurations.
- Consider proposing a remote session for complex issues that may require real-time troubleshooting.
