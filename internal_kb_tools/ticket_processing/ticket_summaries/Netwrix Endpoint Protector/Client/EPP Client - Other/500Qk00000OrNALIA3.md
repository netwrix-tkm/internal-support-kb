- **Case Number:** 444263
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OUHSC
- **Contact Name:** Chisum Thompson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Server), 6.2.4.1 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the compatibility and support of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) Windows Client versions 6.2.4.1 (x32 and x64) on Windows 10 and 11 systems running on ARM processors. They needed confirmation before approving the purchase of ARM-based systems for their security software.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Version:** 6.2.4.1 (available only in x32 and x64)
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 10 and 11
- **Processor Architecture:** ARM (not currently tested by the customer)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was informed about the current lack of support for ARM processors in the EPP clients.
2. Checked with internal resources (Eduard) to confirm the compatibility status.
3. Engaged in discussions regarding future plans for ARM processor support in the engineering chat.
4. Communicated the findings back to the customer, including future plans for compatibility.

## Root Cause
The current versions of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector clients (6.2.4.1) do not support ARM processors on Windows 10 and 11 systems. This limitation is due to the absence of ARM compatibility in the existing client versions.

## Solution
The customer was informed that while ARM processor support is not available in the current release (5.9.4.3), there are plans to implement this compatibility in future releases of the EPP clients. The customer was advised to wait for the upcoming updates before proceeding with any purchases of ARM-based systems.

## Notes
- It is important to keep track of future releases for updates on ARM processor compatibility.
- Customers should be informed that current versions do not support ARM processors to avoid potential issues with untested configurations.
- Ensure to follow up with the customer regarding any updates on the implementation of ARM support in future releases.
