- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C4mLiIAJ
- **Case Number:** 412464
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kannan International Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Vasanth Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Client - Other
- **Feature:** Content Integrity Fail & Unplanned Client Termination

## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple occurrences of "Content Integrity Fail" and "Unplanned Client Termination" events within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector logs. They sought clarification on the causes of these events and potential solutions.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on a Mac OS environment.
- The customer had recently renewed their license for Mac OS only.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided a list of potential causes for the "Content Integrity Fail" event, including:
   - Requirement for full disk access.
   - Missing certificate in Keychain.
   - Network extension not allowed by the user.
   - Missing installation file.
   - Bluetooth permissions not granted.
2. Suggested checking the server UI for more detailed logs by enabling 'File Name' and 'File Type' columns in the Reports and Analysis section.
3. Explained that "Unplanned Client Termination" events are typically caused by:
   - Forced shutdowns (e.g., power loss).
   - The EPP client being killed by the operating system.
   - Crashes of the EPP client.
4. Provided instructions to verify client-server communication using:
   - Shortcut: Command + ALT + I in the EPP client settings.
   - Terminal command: `telnet server IP 443`.
5. Investigated the licensing issue when the customer reported that some features were still showing as expired despite renewal.

## Root Cause
The "Content Integrity Fail" events were attributed to various potential causes, primarily related to permissions and configurations on the Mac OS. The "Unplanned Client Termination" events were linked to ungraceful shutdowns or crashes of the EPP client. The licensing issue arose because the customer had only renewed the license for Mac OS, leading to other OS licenses showing as expired.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clarifying the causes of the "Content Integrity Fail" and "Unplanned Client Termination" events.
- Confirming that the customer had only renewed the license for Mac OS, which explained the expired notifications for other OSs.
- Providing detailed instructions for checking client-server communication and ensuring proper configurations.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the necessary permissions and configurations required for the EPP client to function correctly on Mac OS.
- When renewing licenses, confirm with the customer which operating systems they require coverage for to avoid confusion regarding expired features.
