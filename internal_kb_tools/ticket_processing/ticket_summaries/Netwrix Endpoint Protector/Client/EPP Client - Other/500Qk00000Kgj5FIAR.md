## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving excessive notifications from the application level after managing rules in their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy for a test group. The notifications were described as annoying, and the customer requested assistance in reducing them.

## Environment Details
- Endpoint Protector Server version: 5.9.4.0 (upgraded to 5.9.4.1 during troubleshooting)
- EPP Client version: 6.2.2.1006 (uninstalled and replaced with 6.2.4.2000)
- Features enabled: "Stealthy DPI Driver" and "Notifications Pop-up"

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Upgraded the Endpoint Protector Server from version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1.
2. Uninstalled the EPP Client version 6.2.2.1006 and restarted the machine.
3. Installed the latest EPP Client version 6.2.4.2000.
4. Enabled the "Stealthy DPI Driver" feature.
5. Enabled the "Notifications Pop-up" feature.
6. Enabled debug logs and collected logs while reproducing the issue of multiple event log entries.
7. Removed monitored URL Categories under the Content Aware Protection policy as they were unnecessary for the described use case.
8. Tested the scenario in a test environment to reproduce the issue.

## Root Cause
The excessive notifications were primarily due to the configuration of the Content Aware Protection policy, which included unnecessary monitored URL categories that triggered multiple event log entries.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following actions were taken:
- Refined the Content Aware Protection settings by removing unnecessary monitored URL categories.
- Suggested disabling DPI Bypass logs and utilizing contextual detection and regular expressions to reduce false positives and multiple event log entries.
- The customer confirmed satisfaction with the adjustments, leading to the closure of the case.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly review and refine DLP policies to avoid excessive notifications.
- Consider enabling debug logs only when necessary to minimize performance impact.
- Future cases involving excessive notifications should assess the Content Aware Protection settings and the relevance of monitored URL categories.
