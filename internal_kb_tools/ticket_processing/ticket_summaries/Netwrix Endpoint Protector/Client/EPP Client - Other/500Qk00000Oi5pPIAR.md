## Problem Description
The customer reported that selecting the Transparent client type automatically disables sound drivers, Bluetooth drivers, and webcam drivers.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in multiple versions of the client, specifically 6.2.4.2 and 6.2.5.1002.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered initial details about the issue on 02.05.
2. Confirmed that the issue disappears when reverting to Normal mode on 05.05.
3. Sent a new client version to the customer for testing on 05.05.
4. Verified that the issue persisted with the new client on 07.05 and requested a remote session to gather logs.
5. Collected logs and a recording on 13.05.
6. Tested with versions 6.2.4.2 and 6.2.5.1002, confirming the issue was present in both.
7. Opened an ADO for further investigation on 14.05.
8. Received a test build from R&D on 26.05 and forwarded it to the customer for feedback.
9. Followed up with the customer on 29.05 regarding their testing of the test build.
10. Confirmed the resolution of the issue on 03.06, with the customer reporting that Bluetooth and audio now function correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect where the Transparent client type incorrectly disabled certain device drivers, including sound and Bluetooth.

## Solution
A test build was provided by R&D that corrected the behavior of the Transparent client type, allowing sound and Bluetooth drivers to function correctly while still blocking other device types as intended.

## Notes
- The customer noted that while the test build resolved the issues with sound and Bluetooth, other device types were still being blocked, which is expected behavior.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should ensure they are using the latest client version and report any discrepancies in driver functionality when switching between client types.
