## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EArr0IAD
- **Case Number:** 417562
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ingevity
- **Contact Name:** Jody Mullinax
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** EPP Client - Other
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Azure Directory Admin Center (DSAC) being blocked by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). Despite previously adding `dsac.exe` to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list, the application was still being blocked after a recent server and client upgrade.

## Environment Details
- **Application:** Azure Directory Admin Center (DSAC)
- **Security Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)
- **Client Version:** 11.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that `dsac.exe` was added to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list.
2. Attempted to remove and re-add the exception for `dsac.exe`.
3. Downgraded the client version to see if the issue persisted.
4. Checked for any additional logs or alerts from the EPP regarding blocked applications.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the EPP's mtp (Managed Threat Protection) scanning feature blocking the DSAC application, despite the exception being configured.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the EPP settings to ensure that the mtp scanning feature would not block the DSAC application. This involved:
- Modifying the scanning rules to allow `dsac.exe` to run without interference from the EPP.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review and update the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list after any software upgrades to ensure that critical applications are not inadvertently blocked.
- Future upgrades to the EPP client may require re-evaluation of exception settings to maintain application accessibility.
