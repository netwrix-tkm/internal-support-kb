## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DR4CyIAL
- **Case Number:** 415764
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Riga International Airport
- **Contact Name:** Martins Kupsis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client - BSOD
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that one of their computers experienced a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) after deploying a new version of the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) agent (version 6.2.2.2). The BSOD was associated with the file `cssdlp20.sys`.

## Environment Details
- **Affected System:** Windows operating system
- **EPP Version:** 6.2.2.2

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team analyzed the amp file related to the BSOD but could not reach a definitive conclusion.
2. Suggested sending the customer a newer client version (build 5940 or the RC candidate for 5941) for testing on the affected machines.
3. Requested the customer to gather a new dump file if the issue persisted after the update.
4. Inquired about the frequency of the BSOD occurrence (e.g., at every Windows boot) and requested client logs for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the BSOD was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was suspected that the issue was related to the specific version of the EPP agent deployed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer reported that after installing the latest version of the EPP agent, the computers began functioning without experiencing BSODs. The specific version that resolved the issue was not detailed, but it was implied that the update addressed the underlying problem.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the performance of the EPP agent after updates, especially when deploying new versions.
- If similar BSOD issues arise in the future, consider advising customers to test newer builds of the EPP agent and gather relevant logs and dump files for analysis.
