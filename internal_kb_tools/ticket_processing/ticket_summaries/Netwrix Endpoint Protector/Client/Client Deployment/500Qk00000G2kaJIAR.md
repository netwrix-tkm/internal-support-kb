- **Account/Company:** Children's Medical Center of Dallas - Auditor

## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple permission prompts while testing the Sequoia macOS with the latest EPP client version 3.0.3.1. They sought a solution to suppress these prompts to avoid user confusion and unnecessary support tickets.

## Environment Details
- Testing on Sequoia macOS
- EPP client version: 3.0.3.1
- Full disk access was not initially enabled for the agent.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer rebuilt the laptop with the latest macOS and performed a fresh installation of the EPP client.
2. The support team requested and reviewed installation logs to identify the cause of the permission prompts.
3. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
4. The engineering team was consulted regarding the behavior of the permission prompts.
5. A test build was provided to the customer to determine if it resolved the issue.

## Root Cause
The permission prompts were triggered because the EPP agent did not have the full disk access property enabled. This is a requirement for the agent to register for Bluetooth notifications without prompting the user.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling full disk access for the EPP agent. Additionally, a test build was provided that suppressed the notifications when full disk access was enabled. The customer confirmed that the test build worked correctly and the prompts were no longer displayed.

## Notes
- It is important for future installations of the EPP agent to ensure that full disk access is granted, especially when using third-party solutions like MDM for deployment.
- The test build provided should only be installed on a limited number of computers for testing purposes before wider deployment.
- If the behavior of the Bluetooth pop-up is changed, it will not be displayed at all, allowing administrators to check server logs for Bluetooth control status instead.
