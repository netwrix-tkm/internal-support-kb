## Problem Description
The customer reported a licensing issue where they purchased 400 licenses (200 for Windows devices and 200 for Linux devices) but installed the EPP agent on more than 200 Windows devices. All Windows devices showed as "Online," and they also installed the agent on 135 Linux devices. The customer was concerned about the apparent conflict with their license allocation, particularly since they paid separately for Linux licenses.

## Environment Details
- **Licenses Purchased:** 400 total (200 Windows, 200 Linux)
- **Devices Installed:**
  - Windows: More than 200
  - Linux: 135

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the licensing allocation and installation records for the EPP agent on both Windows and Linux devices.
2. Confirmed the number of licenses purchased and the distribution between Windows and Linux.
3. Checked the status of the installed agents on all devices to verify their online status.
4. Communicated with the sales team to clarify the licensing terms and conditions.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of the licensing model. The EPP agent allowed installation on Windows devices beyond the allocated license count, which led to confusion regarding the licensing limits.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the licensing terms with the sales team. It was confirmed that the installation of the EPP agent on Windows devices did not violate the licensing agreement, as the licenses were not strictly enforced at the installation level. The customer was informed that they could continue using the agents as installed, but they should monitor their usage to ensure compliance with their licensing agreement.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to understand the licensing model and any limitations regarding the installation of agents on different platforms.
- Future inquiries regarding licensing should involve a review of the sales agreements to ensure accurate information is provided to customers.
- Consider providing clearer documentation on licensing terms to prevent similar misunderstandings.
