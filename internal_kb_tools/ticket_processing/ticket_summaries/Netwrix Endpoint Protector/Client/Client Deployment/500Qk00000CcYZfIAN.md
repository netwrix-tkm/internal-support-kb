## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CcYZfIAN
- **Case Number:** 413926
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Toshiba Sustainability Solutions Europe
- **Contact Name:** Nicoleta
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Toshiba, requested an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the Debian 12 client for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, as they were planning to start a proof of concept (POC) within the month.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Client OS:** Debian 12

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the request and confirmed that a request for the Debian 12 client was registered.
2. Informed the customer that the client would be available only after the release of server version 5.8.4.0, but no specific ETA was provided.
3. Provided a link to a test build of the Debian 12 client for the customer to use during the POC.
4. Followed up on the status of the Debian 12 client, confirming that it was undergoing QA testing for production purposes.
5. Communicated the availability of a non-QA tested build for immediate use.

## Root Cause
The delay in providing the Debian 12 client was due to the dependency on the release of the server version 5.8.4.0, which was necessary before the client could be finalized and made available.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a test build of the Debian 12 client, allowing them to proceed with their proof of concept while the final version was being prepared for release.

## Notes
- It is important to keep customers informed about the status of client releases, especially when they are waiting for specific versions for critical projects.
- Always provide alternative solutions, such as test builds, when official releases are delayed to maintain customer engagement and satisfaction.
