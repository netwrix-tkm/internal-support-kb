- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to download the client installation files for Windows from the Appliance after updating to version 9.4.0. The download button was unresponsive across multiple browsers and computers, although downloading the MacOS client software was successful.

## Environment Details
- **Appliance Version:** 9.4.0
- **Operating Systems Tested:** Windows (multiple versions), MacOS (successful download)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the functionality of the download button on multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Tested the download process on different computers to rule out local machine issues.
3. Confirmed that downloading the MacOS client software was functioning correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by Sophos, which was preventing the Epp client from downloading.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the settings in Sophos to allow the download of the Epp client. Once the necessary permissions were granted, the customer was able to successfully download the Windows client installation files.

## Notes
- Ensure that any security software, such as Sophos, is configured to allow downloads from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector appliance to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to inform users about potential conflicts with security software when upgrading to new versions of the appliance.
