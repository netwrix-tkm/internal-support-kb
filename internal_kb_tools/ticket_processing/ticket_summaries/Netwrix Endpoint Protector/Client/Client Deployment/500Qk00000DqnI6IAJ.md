## Problem Description
The customer, Bank Aladin Syariah, requested an installation script for macOS endpoints to be used with FileWave, a third-party deployment tool. They noted that the existing technical documentation only provided guidance for JAMF.

## Environment Details
- Deployment Tool: FileWave
- Existing Documentation: JAMF

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing technical documentation for JAMF.
2. Assessed the requirements for adapting the JAMF installation script for use with FileWave.
3. Communicated with the customer to clarify their specific needs regarding the installation script.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the lack of an installation script tailored for FileWave, as the provided documentation was exclusively for JAMF.

## Solution
A template for the installation script was created and shared with the customer, allowing them to adjust it for use with FileWave.

## Notes
- Ensure that future documentation includes installation scripts for multiple deployment tools to accommodate various customer needs.
- Consider providing a general template that can be easily modified for different platforms to streamline support requests.
