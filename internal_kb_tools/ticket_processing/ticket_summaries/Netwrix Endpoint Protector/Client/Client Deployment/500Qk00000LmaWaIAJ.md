## Problem Description
The customer requested Linux Mint packages for versions 20.2 (Uma), 21, 21.1, and 21.3, along with installation instructions.

## Environment Details
- The request was made for Linux Mint, specifically targeting multiple versions.
- The product in question is Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the request for Linux Mint packages.
2. Provided links to the appropriate client packages for the requested versions:
   - For Linux Mint 20.2 (Uma), the Ubuntu 20.04 client was recommended.
   - For Linux Mint 21.x, the Ubuntu 22.04 client was recommended.
3. Responded to a follow-up inquiry regarding support for Rockey Linux above version 9, indicating that no client is available for that version.

## Root Cause
The initial request was due to the customer's need for specific Linux Mint packages, which were not readily available in the standard repository for Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with direct download links for the appropriate client packages:
- **For Linux Mint 20.2 (Uma):**
  - [Ubuntu 20.04 Client](https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_20.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz)
- **For Linux Mint 21.x:**
  - [Ubuntu 22.04 Client](https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_22.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz)

## Notes
- It is important to note that there is no support for Rockey Linux above version 9, and customers needing support for this version should be directed to submit a feature request through the Netwrix Ideas Portal.
- Future requests for Linux Mint packages should be handled similarly by providing the appropriate Ubuntu client links based on the version specified.
