## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M2jimIAB
- **Case Number:** 436230
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with pushing the EPP (Endpoint Protector) agent to employees' devices through Hexnode. Although the agent installs successfully on the user's devices, it does not appear in the EPP console.

## Environment Details
- **Deployment Tool:** Hexnode
- **Documentation Reference:** Jamf guide from Netwrix

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration with Hexnode, which confirmed that everything was set up correctly on their end.
2. Followed the Jamf guide provided by Netwrix to attempt the deployment.
3. Provided the customer with scripts and Jamf documentation for further assistance.
4. Scheduled a Zoom meeting for real-time troubleshooting, but the customer opted to raise the issue with Hexnode support instead.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not identified within the Netwrix support case. The customer was advised to escalate the matter to Hexnode support for further investigation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to raise the problem with Hexnode support, as the deployment appeared to be functioning correctly on the Netwrix side but not reflecting in the EPP console.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to ensure that all third-party deployment tools (like Hexnode) are correctly configured and functioning as expected.
- Future cases involving similar deployment issues should consider checking the integration and communication between the deployment tool and the EPP console.
- The customer also raised a separate ticket regarding a Zoom meeting issue, which is unrelated to this case.
