## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while attempting to install the EPP client for CentOS on an Amazon Linux 2 server, encountering multiple errors during the installation process.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Amazon Linux 2

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The initial EPP client version provided was for CentOS, which was not compatible with Amazon Linux 2.
2. A download link for an older version of the EPP client for Amazon Linux 2 was shared with the customer.
3. The customer attempted to install the older version but encountered multiple dependency errors related to missing packages.
4. The support team escalated the issue internally to find a compatible version.
5. A newer version of the EPP client specifically for Amazon Linux 2 was identified and provided to the customer.

## Root Cause
The initial EPP client provided was not compatible with Amazon Linux 2, leading to dependency issues during installation. The older version lacked necessary libraries and packages required by the EPP client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a compatible version of the EPP client for Amazon Linux 2:
- **Download Link:** [EPPClient_amzn_2_v2.4.1.2001_x86_64.tar.gz](https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPClient_v2.4.1.2001/EPPClient_amzn_2_v2.4.1.2001_x86_64.tar.gz)
The customer confirmed that this version worked correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure to verify the compatibility of software versions with the specific operating system before providing download links to customers.
- Future installations on Amazon Linux 2 should utilize the latest compatible EPP client version to avoid similar dependency issues.
