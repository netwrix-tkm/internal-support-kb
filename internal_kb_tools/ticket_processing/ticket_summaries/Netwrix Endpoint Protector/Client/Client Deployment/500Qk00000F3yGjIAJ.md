- **Case Number:** 419450
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OCDC
- **Contact Name:** Sam Garner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with provisioning clients through Intune. Although the installation of the clients was successful, they were not connecting to the server, resulting in a failure to communicate or receive policies.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Deployment Method:** Intune

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the client on the endpoints.
2. Attempted to establish a connection to the server.
3. Used the zap tool on the problematic computers to reset the client installation.
4. Reinstalled the agent after using the zap tool.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was implied that there may have been a problem with the initial client installation or configuration that prevented proper communication with the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using the zap tool on the affected computers, which allowed for a clean installation of the agent. After the reinstallation, the agent functioned as intended, establishing a connection to the server and allowing the clients to receive policies.

## Notes
- It is recommended to use the zap tool for any future client installation issues to ensure a clean state before reinstalling the agent.
- Monitor the clients after installation to confirm they are properly connecting to the server and receiving policies.
