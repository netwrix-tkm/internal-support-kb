## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NYOU6IAP
- **Case Number:** 440568
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Pinewood Shepperton
- **Contact Name:** John Chase
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** 5.9.4.3 (upcoming)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that on macOS version 15, users receive a prompt upon login asking for permission for Endpoint Protector to access Bluetooth. This prompt was not present in the previous macOS version (13). The customer is using Jamf Pro in an MDM environment but cannot manage this prompt with a PPPC profile.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 15
- **MDM Solution:** Jamf Pro
- **Previous OS Version:** macOS 13

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue by replicating the problem in a similar environment.
2. Investigated the cause of the Bluetooth prompt, determining it was related to the agent lacking full disk access.
3. Discussed potential solutions with the development team.
4. Provided the customer with a test build of the agent that was designed to suppress the Bluetooth prompt.

## Root Cause
The Bluetooth prompt appeared because the Endpoint Protector agent did not have the full disk access property enabled. This issue arises when the agent attempts to register for Bluetooth notifications, which cannot be manipulated by the daemon without the necessary permissions.

## Solution
A test build of the Endpoint Protector agent was provided to the customer, which successfully suppressed the Bluetooth prompt after enabling full disk access. The fix for this issue will be included in the upcoming server version 5.9.4.3, although no specific release date was provided.

## Notes
- The customer should ensure that full disk access is granted to the Endpoint Protector agent to avoid similar prompts in the future.
- The fix will be included in the next server version, and customers are advised to follow the Netwrix newsletter for updates on the release.
- It is recommended to test any new builds on a limited number of machines before wider deployment.
