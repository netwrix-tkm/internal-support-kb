## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KXaKYIA1
- **Case Number:** 431845
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Splashtop
- **Contact Name:** Sam Chang
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment

## Problem Description
The customer incorrectly configured the Server IP during deployment in Intune, and the client was already installed. They inquired about the possibility of changing the Server IP without needing to reinstall the client.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Deployment Method:** Intune

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer requested scripts to change the Server IP.
2. Provided the necessary change IP scripts to the customer.
3. Awaited confirmation from the customer after script execution.

## Root Cause
The issue arose from an incorrect Server IP configuration during the initial deployment of the client via Intune.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by providing the customer with change IP scripts, which successfully updated the Server IP configuration. After executing the scripts, the EPP Clients began communicating correctly with the EPP Server.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct Server IP is configured during the initial deployment to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the communication between the client and server after making configuration changes.
