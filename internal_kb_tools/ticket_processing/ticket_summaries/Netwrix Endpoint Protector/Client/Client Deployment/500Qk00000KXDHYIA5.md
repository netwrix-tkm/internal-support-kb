- **Case Number:** 431822
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Renewbuy
- **Contact Name:** Anil Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** Ubuntu 23.4 and 24

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in installing the DLP (Data Loss Prevention) endpoint protector on Ubuntu versions 23.4 and 24. Additionally, they reported issues with creating department-wise policies after renaming hostnames in their organization, as they were unable to find the new hostnames while creating custom policies.

## Environment Details
- Operating Systems: Ubuntu 23.4 and 24
- Existing DLP agents already installed on the systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with installation scripts for the DLP endpoint protector on Ubuntu versions 23.4 and 24.
2. Investigated the issue with the renamed hostnames and their visibility in the policy creation interface.
3. Confirmed that the DLP agents were functioning correctly on the renamed hosts.

## Root Cause
The issue with the custom policy creation was due to the DLP agents not being updated with the new hostnames after the renaming process. The existing policies were still linked to the old hostnames, which caused the new hostnames to be unrecognized during policy creation.

## Solution
- The customer was provided with updated scripts for installing the DLP endpoint protector on the specified Ubuntu versions.
- Instructed the customer to ensure that the DLP agents were re-registered with the new hostnames to allow for proper policy management.
- Confirmed that the policies could be created successfully once the agents were updated.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that DLP agents are re-registered or updated after any hostname changes to avoid issues with policy management.
- Future installations on Ubuntu should follow the provided scripts to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.
