## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CpEq3IAF
- **Case Number:** 414443
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** 5.7.1.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that newly installed Windows Server clients were unable to communicate with the server. This issue occurred despite successful telnet connections to port 443, indicating that the network was functioning correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.7.1.0
- **Operating System:** Windows Server (specific version not provided)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified network connectivity by testing telnet to port 443 on the server.
2. Checked the status of licenses for the Windows Server clients to ensure availability.
3. Investigated potential configuration issues related to the server and client communication.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by TLS 1.2 being disabled on the Windows machines. This configuration prevented the clients from establishing a secure connection to the server.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by enabling TLS 1.2 on the affected Windows machines. Once TLS 1.2 was enabled, the clients were able to successfully connect to the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that TLS 1.2 is enabled on all Windows Server clients to avoid similar connectivity issues in the future.
- If clients do not appear in the Web UI, verify the availability of licenses as this can also affect client-server communication.
