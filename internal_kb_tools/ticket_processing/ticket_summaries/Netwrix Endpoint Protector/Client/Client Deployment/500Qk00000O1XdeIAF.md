## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O1XdeIAF
- **Case Number:** 441862
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Schw√§bische Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Andre Knittel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a high failure rate when attempting to update the Endpoint Protector on client machines via the server. To ensure all clients maintain the same software version, they sought to manage updates through their own software distribution system. A challenge arose due to the presence of an uninstall password, which they needed to bypass for silent uninstallation before installing the new version.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The updates were previously managed through a server-based deployment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer inquired about the possibility of passing a parameter to the .msi file for silent uninstallation using the uninstall password.
2. Customer requested an alternative method to disable the need for the uninstall password prior to uninstallation.
3. Support provided uninstall parameters for both Windows and Mac systems.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the requirement of an uninstall password for the Endpoint Protector, which prevented silent uninstallation during the update process.

## Solution
The support team provided the following uninstall parameters to allow for silent uninstallation with the password included:

For **Windows**:
```bash
msiexec.exe /x <PATH to MSI file> ADMIN_PASSWORD_0="ADD_UNINSTALL_PASSWORD_HERE" /qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress
```

For **Mac**:
```bash
/Applications/EndpointProtectorClient.app/Contents/Applications/EppNotifier.app/Contents/MacOS/remove-epp ADD_PASSWORD_HERE
```
The customer successfully implemented these parameters in their software distribution system, allowing for the uninstallation and subsequent installation of the new version without issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the uninstall password is securely managed and not exposed in scripts or logs.
- Future customers facing similar issues should be advised to use the provided uninstall parameters for seamless updates.
- It may be beneficial to document any changes in the uninstall process or parameters in future releases of the Endpoint Protector.
