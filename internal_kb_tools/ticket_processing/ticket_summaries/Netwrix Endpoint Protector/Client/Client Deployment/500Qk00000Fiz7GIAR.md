- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FNB - First National Bank
- **Contact Name:** Clint Swartz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Deployment
- **Version:** EPP client version 6.2.3.1010, Server version v5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client version 6.2.3.1010 supports the new MacOS 15 Sequoia. Additionally, they requested a Linux client for Debian 12.1, as they had not received a response to a previous request submitted via the Endpoint Protector site.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** MacOS 15 Sequoia, Debian 12.1
- **EPP Client Version:** 6.2.3.1010
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the compatibility of EPP client version 6.2.3.1010 with MacOS 15 Sequoia.
2. Reviewed the request for a Linux client for Debian 12.1.
3. Escalated the ticket to verify if the existing Debian 12 installer would work for Debian 12.1.
4. Provided the customer with the link to the official EPP Client build for Debian 12.1.

## Root Cause
The initial inquiry stemmed from uncertainty regarding the compatibility of the EPP client with the newly released MacOS 15 Sequoia and the lack of response for the Linux client request.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the EPP client version 6.2.3.1010 is compatible with MacOS 15 Sequoia. The customer was also provided with the necessary link to download the EPP client for Debian 12.1, which is based on the existing Debian 12 official EPP Client build.

## Notes
- For future Linux client requests, it is recommended to raise requests via the Product Board to ensure timely responses.
- The Debian 12.1 client can utilize the existing Debian 12 installer without the need for a separate installer.
