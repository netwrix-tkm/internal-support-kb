- **Case Number:** 414954
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Schw√§bische Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Andre Knittel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that multiple computers in their environment were not connecting to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server. As a result, client updates were failing, and devices connected to these computers were not being monitored or restricted, leading to potential security risks.

## Environment Details
- Approximately 1600 computers in the network.
- Computers connect to the network via ZScaler, indicating a consistent internet connection.
- Some computers had not reported to the Endpoint Protector server for up to two years.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified network connectivity for affected computers.
2. Checked the Endpoint Protector server logs for any error messages related to client connections.
3. Confirmed that the licensing configuration was set to revoke licenses after 15 days of inactivity.
4. Investigated whether the affected computers were retaining their last known permissions despite being offline.
5. Reviewed the Endpoint Protector client installation and update processes on the affected machines.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the communication between the Endpoint Protector clients and the server, which resulted in the clients not reporting their status or receiving updates. This failure persisted despite the computers having a valid internet connection.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the Endpoint Protector server was functioning correctly and that the licensing settings were appropriately configured. The customer was advised to monitor the affected machines and ensure that they were properly connected to the Endpoint Protector server. The ticket was closed upon customer confirmation that the issue was no longer occurring.

## Notes
- It is crucial to regularly monitor the connection status of all Endpoint Protector clients to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that licensing configurations are reviewed periodically to avoid unintended access to devices.
- Consider implementing alerts for when a client has not reported to the server for an extended period, to proactively address potential security risks.
