- **Contact Name:** Obinna Okafor
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 1.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the patch/hotfixes applied to the EPP server were also applicable to the EPP client.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically regarding the deployment of security patches to both server and client components.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the EPP clients contained the necessary fix on the client side.
2. Provided download links for the updated EPP clients for both MacOS and Windows:
   - MacOS: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar)
   - Windows: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip)
3. Addressed the customer's question regarding the possibility of performing the upgrade via the Server UI.
4. Suggested using an Offline Client Patch to add EPP clients to the UI for easier upgrades:
   - Provided the link to the Offline Client patch: [Download Offline Client Patch](http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz)
5. Instructed the customer on how to upload the Offline Client patch through the Dashboard:
   - Navigate to Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader.
   - Browse for the downloaded patch and upload it.
   - Confirm successful installation via the Dashboard.

## Root Cause
The initial confusion stemmed from the customer not being aware that the EPP clients also required a separate patch to be applied, despite the server being updated.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to download and apply the Offline Client patch, which allowed the EPP clients to be added to the Server UI for subsequent upgrades. The customer confirmed that the upgrade was successfully completed.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that both server and client components are updated with the appropriate patches to maintain security compliance.
- Future inquiries regarding patch applicability should clarify the need for separate updates for client components when server updates are performed.
