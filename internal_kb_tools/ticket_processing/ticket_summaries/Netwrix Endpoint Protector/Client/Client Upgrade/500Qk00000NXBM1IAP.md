- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NXBM1IAP
- **Case Number:** 440521
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sauce Labs
- **Contact Name:** Anish Mehta
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5941

## Problem Description
The customer reported inaccurate and duplicate data under the Device Control - Computers section during an audit. Specifically, searching for the Serial number `HWT4T39WFJ` returned an entry associated with the username “rhyscote,” which was believed to be linked to a different Serial number. The CSV export reflected the same inaccuracies as displayed in the user interface.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server was running an outdated version, approximately 2-3 years behind the latest updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the reported issue and confirmed the inaccuracies in the UI and CSV export.
2. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to investigate further.
3. Upgraded the EPP server to the latest version (5941).
4. Upgraded the EPP client to the latest version.

## Root Cause
The inaccuracies in the data were due to the EPP server and client being significantly outdated, which likely caused discrepancies in how Serial numbers were recorded and displayed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Upgrading the EPP server to version 5941.
- Upgrading the EPP client to the latest version, which was 2-3 years behind.
After these upgrades, the Serial number was updated and displayed correctly in both the UI and the CSV export.

## Notes
- Ensure that both the EPP server and client are kept up to date to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regular audits and checks should be performed to verify data accuracy, especially after significant updates.
