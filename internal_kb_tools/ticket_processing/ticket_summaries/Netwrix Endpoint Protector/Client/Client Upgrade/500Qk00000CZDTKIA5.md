- **Case Number:** 413746
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NHS Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Southampton
- **Contact Name:** Dave Andrews
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.1.0.6 to 6.2.2.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested release notes for the EPP Client to justify an upgrade from version 6.1.0.6 to 6.2.2.1, as their contract stipulates that upgrades should only address security vulnerabilities, not functionality.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific versions in question are 6.1.0.6 (current) and 6.2.2.1 (proposed upgrade).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician, Emil Podar, communicated with the customer to confirm the request for release notes.
2. Emil checked internally for the availability of the release notes for the EPP Client.
3. Emil informed the customer that the EPP Clients would be treated separately and that there would be another patch to add the new EPP Clients to the server.
4. Emil followed up with the customer regarding the urgency of the request due to an upcoming emergency CAB meeting.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the unavailability of specific release notes for the EPP Client, which the customer needed to assess the necessity of the upgrade.

## Solution
The release notes for the EPP Client were eventually located and sent to the customer, allowing them to make an informed decision regarding the upgrade.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that release notes for all components, including EPP Clients, are readily available to avoid delays in customer requests.
- Future support staff should be aware that client upgrades may require separate documentation and should verify the availability of such documents promptly.
