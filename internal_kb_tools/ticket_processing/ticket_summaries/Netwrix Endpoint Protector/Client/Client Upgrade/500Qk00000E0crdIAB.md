## Problem Description
The customer reported that during the upgrade process of the EPP client to version 6.2.3.1, all running programs would freeze, displaying a Windows notification stating "Not responding." This issue occurred specifically when upgrading from an older version for the first time.

## Environment Details
- The issue was replicated on two PCs during the initial upgrade from an older version to 6.2.3.1.
- The upgrade was performed via the EPP console.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the upgrade process and the version being upgraded from.
2. Attempted to recreate the issue on the same machines where it was initially reported, but the problem did not reoccur.
3. Reviewed system logs for any errors or warnings during the upgrade process.
4. Consulted with the development team to check for known issues related to the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that the freezing behavior occurred only during the first upgrade from an older version, suggesting a potential compatibility or resource allocation issue during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the freezing behavior was not reproducible on subsequent attempts. The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any further occurrences. The case was closed after the customer confirmed that they were satisfied with the resolution.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the upgrade process closely, especially during the first upgrade from older versions.
- If similar issues arise in the future, consider checking for system resource availability and compatibility between versions.
- Document any specific configurations or environmental factors that may contribute to such issues for future reference.
