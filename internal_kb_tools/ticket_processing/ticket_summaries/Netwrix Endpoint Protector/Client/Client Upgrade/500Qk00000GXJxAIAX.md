- **Case Number:** 422667
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Booking.com
- **Contact Name:** Serhat Demir
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether a computer restart is mandatory after upgrading the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent or enabling/disabling the Data Protection Integration (DPI) feature, following a new caution statement in the v5.9.4 documentation.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector v5.9.4
- **Upcoming Version:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector v5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the documentation for Netwrix Endpoint Protector v5.9.4 to confirm the new caution statement regarding mandatory restarts.
2. Clarified with the customer that due to the Network extension, a reboot is required after enabling/disabling DPI or upgrading the agent.
3. Informed the customer that the upcoming version (5.9.4.1) is expected to eliminate the need for mandatory restarts.

## Root Cause
The requirement for a computer restart after enabling/disabling DPI or upgrading the agent was due to changes in the Network extension functionality in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector v5.9.4 version.

## Solution
The customer's question was addressed by confirming that a restart is mandatory for the current version (5.9.4) but will not be necessary after upgrading to version 5.9.4.1. The customer was advised to proceed with the update and test the functionality post-upgrade.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to users that a restart is required after certain actions in the current version to ensure consistent DPI behavior.
- Monitor the performance and functionality after the upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 to confirm that the restart requirement has been resolved.
