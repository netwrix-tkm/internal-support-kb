- **Case Number:** 437221
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix
- **Contact Name:** Andreas Ster
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.2.4.0111 (test build)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that upgrading the EPP agent from the console or manually using the installation package caused the department assignment of the machines to revert to the default department (defdep) instead of retaining the configured department.

## Environment Details
- The customer was testing with approximately 1000 endpoints across 10 departments.
- The issue was reproducible when the department code was not explicitly mentioned in the title of the MSI package.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Andreas tested the upgrade process multiple times using the EPP console and the command line with the following command:
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /i pathtotheeppclientmsi/EPPClientSetup.5.8.0.1_x86_64.msi /qn
   ```
2. Verified that the department reverted to defdep after the upgrade.
3. Confirmed that the department remained unchanged only when the department code was included in the MSI title.
4. Conducted a manual installation of the package without encountering the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a bug in the upgrade process where the department assignment was not retained unless the department code was specified in the MSI package title.

## Solution
The R&D team provided a test build (version 6.2.4.0111) that resolved the issue. The following steps were recommended for testing:
1. Install an older version of the EPP client (e.g., 6.2.3.1xxx).
2. Upgrade to the provided test build.
3. Ensure that the department is set to a custom one before applying the upgrade.
4. The upgrade could be performed using either the GUI installer or the command line.

Andreas confirmed that the test build worked as expected, retaining the department assignments during the upgrade.

## Notes
- Ensure that the department code is included in the MSI title for future installations to avoid reverting to the default department.
- It is advisable to test any new builds in a controlled environment before deploying them widely across endpoints.
