## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OqK1zIAF
- **Case Number:** 444200
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** CoreWin Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Server), 6.2.4.2000 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported a discrepancy between the server version and the agent version for a PrivatBank customer. The server was running version 5.9.4.1, while the EPP server offered a client version of 6.2.4.2000, despite the CoreWin server being at version 5.9.4.2 with an agent version of 6.2.4.1006.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1 (PrivatBank)
- **EPP Client Version Available:** 6.2.4.2000
- **CoreWin Server Version:** 5.9.4.2
- **CoreWin Agent Version:** 6.2.4.1006

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the version history of the server and client.
2. Confirmed that the initial release of server version 5.9.4.1 included client version 6.2.4.1.
3. Identified that subsequent patches to the server version included newer client versions.
4. Explained the possibility of the EPP server offering a newer client version than the one originally released.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the timing of server updates and patches. Customers who upgraded their servers immediately after the initial release received the initial client version, while later patches included newer client versions. This led to the EPP server offering a client version that was newer than the one originally bundled with the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by explaining to the customer the scenario regarding the version discrepancies. It was clarified that it is common for the EPP server to provide newer client versions based on the timing of server updates and patches.

## Notes
- If a specific client version is required, it is advisable to check the release notes or contact Netwrix Support for guidance on compatibility and availability.
- Ensure that both server and client are updated according to the organizationâ€™s maintenance schedule and best practices.
- Consult with Netwrix Support regarding compatibility or upgrade paths before deploying new client versions in production.
