## Problem Description
The customer, Saudi Chevron, reported an issue where they were unable to upgrade their clients via the Client Software Upgrade feature in the management server.

## Environment Details
- Current server version: 5940
- Client versions: 5928 and 6.2.1.2 (for testing purposes)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was instructed to attempt upgrades using two different scenarios:
   - Upgrade from the existing client version 5928 to version 5928 (intermediary version).
   - Upgrade from version 6.2.1.2 to version 6.2.2.1.
2. The customer checked the `eppclient.log` file for error codes during the upgrade attempts.
3. The customer followed the steps outlined in the user manual for creating a deployment tool in Active Directory but reported that it did not work.
4. A virtual meeting was scheduled to discuss the issue further.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the deployment policies in Active Directory. Specifically, the deployment process was not completing due to missing configurations in the Group Policy settings.

## Solution
The customer was advised to enable two specific Group Policy settings to ensure the deployment process could complete successfully:
- **Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon**
- **Specify startup policy processing wait time**

After implementing these changes, the customer was able to successfully upgrade the client software.

## Notes
- It is important for future cases to verify that the necessary Group Policy settings are enabled when deploying software via Active Directory.
- The customer confirmed that they would reach out if any further issues were encountered after the resolution.
