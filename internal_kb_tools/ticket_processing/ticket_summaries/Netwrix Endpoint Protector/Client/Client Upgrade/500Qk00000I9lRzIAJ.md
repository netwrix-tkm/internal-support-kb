## Problem Description
The customer reported that several laptops were experiencing blue screen errors (BSOD) attributed to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client. There was uncertainty regarding whether a recent update or a change in Windows was the cause, raising concerns about potential widespread issues across their environment.

## Environment Details
- Affected systems: Multiple laptops running Windows OS.
- EPP client version: Not specified, but issues arose after a potential update.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to generate log files using the EPP Support Tool.
2. Provided instructions for downloading and running the EPP Support Tool, including:
   - Extracting the tool to a designated folder.
   - Running the tool as an administrator.
   - Creating appended log files and reproducing the blue screen issue.
3. Suggested updating EPP Client policies after log generation.
4. Discussed the possibility of uninstalling the EPP client to recover from the blue screen state.
5. Confirmed that the driver causing the blue screen was identified as `cssdlp20.sys`.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the blue screen errors was identified as a conflict with the EPP client, specifically related to the driver `cssdlp20.sys`. This driver was causing the systems to fail to boot properly, leading to the blue screen state.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by uninstalling and then reinstalling the EPP client on the affected laptops. This action restored normal functionality and eliminated the blue screen errors.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for similar issues after updates to the EPP client.
- If blue screen errors occur again, consider checking for driver conflicts or reverting to a previous version of the EPP client.
- Ensure that local administrator rights are available when running diagnostic tools like the EPP Support Tool.
