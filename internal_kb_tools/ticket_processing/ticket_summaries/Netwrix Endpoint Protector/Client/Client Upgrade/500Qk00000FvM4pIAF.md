## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FvM4pIAF
- **Case Number:** 421363
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stanford University
- **Contact Name:** Spencer Chinn
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 (EPP server), 3.0.2.1 to 3.0.3.1 (client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating to EPP version 5.9.4.0, the client upgrade job created to update the client from version 3.0.2.1 to 3.0.3.1 was unsuccessful. The client did not update, and while the client indicated that policies were received, there were no corresponding entries in the EPP server logs.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.0
- Client Version: 3.0.2.1 attempting to upgrade to 3.0.3.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initiated an "update policies" command from the client agent.
2. Verified that the date and time for "Policy Received" updated on the EPP client.
3. Checked the Logs Report on the EPP server for entries related to policies received after the update command was initiated.
4. Observed logs for USB device connections to confirm logging functionality.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was noted that the EPP client was not properly processing the update job despite indicating that policies were received.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the client was indeed receiving policies but not executing the upgrade. The customer was advised to ensure that the client had the necessary permissions and network access to complete the upgrade process. Further investigation into the clientâ€™s configuration may be required if similar issues arise in the future.

## Notes
- Ensure that the client has proper permissions and network access to receive updates.
- Monitor the EPP server logs for any discrepancies in policy application.
- If issues persist, consider re-initiating the upgrade job or checking for any client-side restrictions that may prevent updates.
