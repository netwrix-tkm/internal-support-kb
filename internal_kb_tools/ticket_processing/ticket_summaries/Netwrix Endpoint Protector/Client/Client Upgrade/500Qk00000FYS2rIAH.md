- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HIWIN GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Marius Bro√ü
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading the server to version 5.9.4.0, they were unable to upgrade most of the clients to version 6.2.3.1. The clients appeared grayed out as if they were offline, despite being online and licensed.

## Environment Details
- Server Version: 5.9.4.0
- Client Version: 6.2.3.1
- Client Status: Online and licensed
- Synchronization Status: Last seen updates were functioning correctly

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the online status of the clients.
2. Checked client licensing to ensure they were still valid.
3. Reviewed server synchronization logs for any discrepancies.
4. Attempted to initiate the upgrade for individual clients to confirm the issue.
5. Investigated existing upgrade jobs for potential conflicts.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by old upgrade jobs that were still present in the system, which interfered with the ability to initiate new upgrade processes for the clients.

## Solution
The resolution involved deleting the old upgrade jobs from the system. Once these jobs were removed, the clients became selectable for the upgrade to version 6.2.3.1.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly clean up old upgrade jobs to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that all clients are verified for their online status and licensing before attempting upgrades.
