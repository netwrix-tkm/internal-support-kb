- **Case Number:** 432002
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stadt Ravensburg
- **Contact Name:** Patrick-Oliver Moll
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.2.3 1010

## Problem Description
The customer reported two issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The first issue was that the EasyLock Client's master password was not functioning, resulting in an incorrect password error. The second issue arose after updating the server to the latest version, where the client could not be updated through the Server Management interface, failing with the message "Abgeschlossen mit Fehlern" (Completed with Errors).

## Environment Details
- The EasyLock Client version reported was 6.2.3 1010.
- The server was updated to the latest version prior to the second issue occurring.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the master password for the EasyLock Client.
2. Attempted to update the EasyLock Client through the Server Management interface.
3. Checked for any error logs or messages during the update process.
4. Engaged in a remote session to further diagnose the issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issues was identified as a mismatch in the master password for the EasyLock Client, which prevented access. Additionally, the failure of the client update was likely related to compatibility issues following the server upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session where the following actions were taken:
- The correct master password was reset and verified.
- The client was successfully updated through the Server Management interface after ensuring compatibility with the new server version.

## Notes
- Ensure that the master password is documented and verified before performing updates to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always check compatibility between client and server versions after an upgrade to prevent update failures.
