- **Case Number:** 415165
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MPR Associates Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Chris Rolin
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.0.1.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the ADV-2024-002 vulnerability and whether their client version 6.0.1.6 was affected. Additionally, they reported that after applying EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 via the live update feature, the security update still appeared in the "available EPP software updates" section.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** Hotfix #1.1 applied
- **Client Version:** 6.0.1.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the client version 6.0.1.6 is affected by the ADV-2024-002 vulnerability.
2. Instructed the customer to check the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section to verify if the hotfix was successfully applied.
3. Explained that the available update may still show up even after applying it.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a failure of the update process; rather, it was a known behavior of the EPP software where the update notification persists even after the hotfix has been applied.

## Solution
The customer was guided to verify the application of the hotfix by checking the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section. It was confirmed that the hotfix had been successfully applied, and the persistence of the update notification was clarified as expected behavior.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that the presence of available updates does not necessarily indicate that the updates have not been applied.
- Always check the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section for confirmation of applied updates to avoid confusion.
