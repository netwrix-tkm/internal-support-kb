## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HKvDFIA1
- **Case Number:** 424690
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OpenPath Products
- **Contact Name:** Christopher Ringley
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.3.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that during an attempted upgrade of Windows clients from version 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.3.1, many systems became unresponsive for several minutes, requiring reboots to restore functionality. Out of 50 systems, only 28 were successfully upgraded.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Systems:** Windows clients
- **Upgrade Versions:** From 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.3.1
- **Number of Systems Attempted:** 50
- **Successful Upgrades:** 28

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked for error logs or codes on the server; none were found.
2. Whitelisted the upgrade location in the firewall.
3. Appended log creation to the `msiexec` command to capture detailed logs.
4. Attempted manual installation of the agent on select computers.
5. Used an MDM tool for the upgrade process but encountered an unknown fatal error.
6. Reviewed logs for errors related to the installation path.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as an issue with the command used for the installation, which was not correctly pointing to the installer path. The logs indicated that `msiexec` could not find the installer at the specified location.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using a VBS script to automate the installation process correctly. This script ensured that the installer was located and executed properly, allowing the upgrade to complete successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the installation path is correctly specified in the command to avoid similar issues in the future.
- When encountering upgrade failures, always check the logs generated by appending `/l*v <path_to_log>` to the `msiexec` command for detailed error information.
- Consider using manual installation as a troubleshooting step to isolate issues related to automated deployment tools.
