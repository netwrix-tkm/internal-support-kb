## Problem Description
The customer, Swaroop Tiyyagura from ServiceNow, requested assistance in obtaining the appropriate CoSoSys client agent versions for MAC, Windows, and Linux after upgrading their CoSoSys server to version 5.8.1.0.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.8.1.0
- **Client Platforms Requested:** MAC, Windows, Linux
- **Linux Distro Version:** Not specified by the customer initially.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the request and confirmed the need for the appropriate client agent versions.
2. Requested the customer to specify the Linux distribution version to provide the correct client.
3. Followed up multiple times to obtain the Linux distro information for accurate client recommendations.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's upgrade of the CoSoSys server without having the corresponding client agents ready for deployment on their client machines. The lack of information regarding the specific Linux distribution further complicated the provision of the correct client agents.

## Solution
The support team provided the necessary CoSoSys client agent versions for MAC, Windows, and Linux once the customer confirmed their Linux distribution. The customer was satisfied with the provided information and confirmed that the case could be closed.

## Notes
- Ensure to always request specific details about the customer's environment, such as the Linux distribution version, when dealing with multi-platform client requests.
- Maintain clear communication and follow-up to ensure all necessary information is gathered for effective support.
