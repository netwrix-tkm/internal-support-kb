Users at Insight Credit Union were unable to print email memos after a recent upgrade, receiving an error message indicating that the print action was blocked in Microsoft Outlook.

## Environment Details

   - Advised clicking "Add to Content" and selecting Outlook in the Whitelisted Applications box, then clicking "Generate".
3. **Policy Update:** Instructed the customer to update the policies on a machine experiencing the issue and test printing again.

5. **Final Testing:** Advised the customer to close and relaunch Outlook after updating the policies and test printing again.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector blocking the print action in Microsoft Outlook due to security settings that were not properly configured after the upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correctly configuring the Advanced Scanning Exceptions to whitelist the Outlook application. The final successful configuration involved entering "Outlook" in the Application Process Name field and ensuring it was added to the Whitelisted Applications.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future upgrades to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector are followed by a review of the Advanced Scanning Exceptions settings to prevent similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to document the specific process names and configurations used for whitelisting applications to streamline future troubleshooting efforts.
