- **Case Number:** 428022
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Manpreet Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.2.2.2005

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to upgrade the EPP client to version 6.2.2.2005 via the Console. They were unable to find this version available for upgrade, as only version 6.2.2.1 was displayed. Additionally, they inquired about the success of deployments pushed via the EPP console and noted that no systems were visible when searching via groups, with the Groups column empty in Device Control - Computers.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Console Version:** 6.2.2.1 (only version available for upgrade)
- **Client Version Attempted for Upgrade:** 6.2.2.2005

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the version of the EPP client currently available in the Console.
2. Discussed the deployment success metrics for upgrades pushed via the EPP console.
3. Investigated the issue of empty Groups column in Device Control - Computers.
4. Conducted a remote session with the customer to further diagnose the issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation in the EPP Console, which did not list the desired upgrade version (6.2.2.2005) due to version availability settings. The empty Groups column was likely due to configuration settings or a lack of systems being assigned to any groups.

## Solution
During the remote session, the support technician explained the version availability and confirmed that the upgrade to version 6.2.2.2005 was not possible through the Console at that time. The technician provided guidance on how to check for successful deployments and addressed the empty Groups column issue by suggesting potential configuration checks. The customer was satisfied with the explanations and requested to close the ticket.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP Console is updated to reflect the latest available versions for upgrades.
- For future cases involving empty Groups in Device Control, verify group assignments and system configurations.
- Document any version limitations clearly to prevent confusion during upgrade requests.
