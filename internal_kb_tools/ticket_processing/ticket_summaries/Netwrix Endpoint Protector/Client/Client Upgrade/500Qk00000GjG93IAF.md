The customer inquired about the default location to view the reasons for client upgrade failures and whether this information could be accessed remotely or required local login to the affected PC.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of Issue:** 1.3 days

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. The customer planned to manually check the event viewer on the remaining failed computer for any failed processes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the upgrade failures was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was indicated that a second upgrade job resolved the issue for all but one computer.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running a second upgrade job, which successfully upgraded all but one of the previously failed computers. The customer was advised to further investigate the remaining failed computer to determine the cause of its failure.

## Notes
- If similar upgrade failures occur on multiple computers, the customer should consider opening a new support ticket.
- Manual checks of the event viewer are recommended for diagnosing failed processes related to client upgrades.
