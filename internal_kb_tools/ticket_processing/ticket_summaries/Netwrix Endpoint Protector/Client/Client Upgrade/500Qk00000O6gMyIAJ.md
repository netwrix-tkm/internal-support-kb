## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O6gMyIAJ
- **Case Number:** 442237
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Management Services Helwig Schmitt GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Jonas GÃ¶rtelmeyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Server), 6.2.3.1 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that client upgrades via the "Client Software Upgrade" process were failing, with a success rate of 0 devices out of 6 clients. The last successful upgrade occurred on December 24, 2024.

## Environment Details
- Server OS: Ubuntu 16.04 (upgraded to a higher version)
- Client OS: Windows 11 (installed on a virtual machine)
- Previous client version: 6.2.3.1
- Current server version: 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the customer to delete old upgrade jobs and retry the upgrade process.
2. Scheduled a remote session (RS) after the customer reported continued issues.
3. During the RS:
   - Verified client communication was successful.
   - Collected logs while the upgrade job was running.
   - Attempted a manual upgrade, which failed with an error indicating the installer was not valid.
   - Noted that the installer was downloaded with a size of 0KB.
   - Uploaded an offline patch for an OTP issue.
   - Successfully downloaded the client installer after applying the patch.
   - Created a new upgrade job, which was successful.
4. Asked the customer to create another upgrade job to confirm the resolution.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by an invalid installer being downloaded (0KB size), which was likely related to the recent server migration and the uninstallation of the "XZ Utils" component due to a CVE.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying an offline patch (MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz) that corrected the installer download issue. After applying the patch, the client installer was successfully downloaded, and subsequent upgrade jobs were successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that any server migrations or component uninstalls are documented, as they may affect client upgrade processes.
- Always verify the integrity of installers before proceeding with upgrades, especially after significant changes to the server environment.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking for valid installer downloads and applying relevant patches as a first step in troubleshooting.
