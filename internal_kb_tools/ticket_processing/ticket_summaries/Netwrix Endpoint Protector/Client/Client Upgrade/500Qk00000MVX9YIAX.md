## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MVX9YIAX
- **Case Number:** 437564
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Poland Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery Center in Pozna≈Ñ
- **Contact Name:** Krystian Przyczynek
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent fails to communicate with the server after upgrading from version 6.2.3.1 to 6.2.4.2. This problem specifically affects devices running Windows 8.1, causing them to go offline. The communication is restored when reverting to the previous version.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Operating System:** Windows 8.1
- **Working Operating Systems:** Windows 10 and Windows 11

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a troubleshooting session with the customer to reproduce the issue on Windows 8.1.
2. Verified that the issue occurs not only during UI client upgrades but also when the 6.2.4.2 client is installed manually.
3. Confirmed that reverting to version 6.2.3.1 restores communication with the server.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix EPP agent due to the updated OpenSSL library embedded in the client. This update resulted in the discontinuation of support for older, unsupported Windows operating systems, including Windows 8.1.

## Solution
The recommended solution was to uninstall the 6.2.4.2 version of the agent and reinstall version 6.2.3.1 on the affected Windows 8.1 devices. This version continues to fulfill its original function and allows for proper communication with the server.

## Notes
- Windows 8.1 is no longer supported by Netwrix, and the last supported client version for this OS is 5.9.4.0.
- Starting in October, no future EPP client versions will be supported for Windows 10 once Microsoft ends its support for that OS.
- Customers using unsupported Windows versions should continue with the last supported version (5.9.4.0) and be aware that no new features will be backported to this release.
