## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DDNXBIA5
- **Case Number:** 415323
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sharecare
- **Contact Name:** Taylor Summers
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for redeploying their Endpoint Protector (EPP) on-premise server. The request was made following a directive from their CISO to upgrade the EPP server, which was previously deemed unnecessary.

## Environment Details
- **Hosting Platform:** AWS
- **Region:** us-east-1
- **Account ID:** 245785830155
- **Current EPP Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Migration Requirements:** Migrate all settings for device control and EasyLock without logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Forwarded the AMI request to the devops team for processing.
2. Upgraded the new EPP server to the same version as the old one (5.9.3.0) along with a vulnerability patch.
3. Migrated the database from the old EPP server to the new one.
4. Verified that the new and old EPP servers were 1-to-1 copies of each other.

## Root Cause
The need for an AMI was driven by the requirement to upgrade the existing EPP server to a newer instance with an up-to-date backend OS, as per the CISO's directive.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Creating an AMI for the new EPP server.
- Ensuring the new server was upgraded to the same version as the old server and included necessary patches.
- Successfully migrating the required settings and configurations from the old server to the new one while excluding logs.

## Notes
- Ensure that future requests for AMIs include clear specifications regarding the desired settings and data to be migrated.
- Always verify that the new server matches the old server's configuration to avoid discrepancies post-migration.
