## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CPri9IAD
- **Case Number:** 413376
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stadtwerke Wolfenb√ºttel GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Alan Wenglord
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Alan Wenglord, reported confusion regarding the application of a hotfix on the server and whether the client agents also needed to be updated. He noted that the server's version number did not change after applying the hotfix and sought clarification on the client agents' version status.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Client Distribution Method:** Clients are not directly updated via EPP.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the server's version number remains unchanged after the hotfix application.
2. Provided the download link for the EPP client to the customer for manual updates.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the hotfix application process. The server's version number does not change with the application of a hotfix, which is standard behavior. The client agents do not automatically update unless explicitly done by the user.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that:
- The server's version number not changing after the hotfix is correct.
- The client agents do not require an update unless the user decides to manually download and install the new version from the provided link.

The following download link for the EPP client was shared:
```
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
```

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly that hotfixes do not alter version numbers and that client updates must be performed manually if not distributed via EPP.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the manual update process for client agents to avoid confusion in the future.
