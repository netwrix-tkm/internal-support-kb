- **Case Number:** 426972
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arity
- **Contact Name:** James Ceart
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the differences users might notice on their end devices following a feature update from version 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0, particularly regarding soft rebranding. They expressed concern that some users may be apprehensive about changes and requested information to prepare them.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Target Version:** 5.9.4.0
- **Platforms:** Windows and macOS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the release notes for versions 5.9.3.0 and 5.9.4.0 to identify any user-facing changes.
2. Confirmed with the development team regarding the impact of the upgrade on end-user experience.
3. Communicated findings to the customer via email.

## Root Cause
The inquiry was based on the customer's need for clarity regarding user experience changes due to the feature update. No significant changes were identified that would affect end users, aside from a visual update to the EPP client icon.

## Solution
The resolution involved confirming that:
- Upgrading the EPP server from 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0 would not result in any visible changes for end users; existing functionalities and policies would remain intact.
- The upgrade of EPP clients would change the client icon logo from a "stoplight" to the Netwrix logo in the system tray (Windows) or top bar (macOS).

This information was communicated to the customer, alleviating their concerns.

## Notes
- It is important to inform users about visual changes, such as logo updates, to prevent confusion or concern.
- Future inquiries regarding feature updates should include a review of both server and client changes to provide comprehensive information to customers.
