## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with upgrading their virtual machines to the new EPP version 6.2.3.1. Most virtual machines were on version 6.2.2.1, while some were still on 6.0.1.6. The scheduled upgrade job was not completing successfully.

## Environment Details
- Virtual machines primarily running versions 6.2.2.1 and 6.0.1.6 of the EPP agent.
- Upgrade job containing over 400 computers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer logged into a problematic virtual machine to investigate the issue.
2. Attempted to determine the cause of the upgrade failure but could not identify any specific issues.
3. Reviewed the scheduled upgrade job containing a large number of computers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the size of the upgrade job, which contained over 400 computers. This large batch size likely caused the upgrade process to fail or become unresponsive.

## Solution
The recommended solution was to delete the existing large upgrade job and create multiple smaller update jobs. This approach allowed for more manageable upgrade processes, which resolved the issue.

## Notes
- For future reference, when dealing with large upgrade jobs, it is advisable to break them down into smaller batches to avoid potential failures.
- Monitor the upgrade process closely after creating new jobs to ensure successful completion.
