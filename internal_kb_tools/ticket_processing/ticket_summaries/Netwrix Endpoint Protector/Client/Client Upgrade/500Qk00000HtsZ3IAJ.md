## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HtsZ3IAJ
- **Case Number:** 426027
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrivatBank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 2.4.3.1007

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that they could not use the same EPP client version for Ubuntu 24.04 and 22.04 due to errors returned by their local repository. Both versions were currently using the same client version (2.4.3.1007), which caused conflicts during installation and updates.

## Environment Details
- Operating Systems: Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- EPP Client Version: 2.4.3.1007

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer provided feedback regarding the issue with the EPP client versioning.
2. Technical support downloaded and compared the client archives for both Ubuntu versions.
3. Clarified with the customer that the issue stemmed from the identical version numbers of the .deb packages for different OS versions.
4. Discussed potential solutions, including modifying the .deb package versioning.
5. Attempted to manually change the .deb package name to resolve the conflict.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the EPP client for both Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 had the same version number (2.4.3.1007). This caused conflicts in the local repository, which does not allow different .deb packages with the same version number, leading to installation and update failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually modifying the .deb package name for the Ubuntu EPP client. The customer confirmed that after the changes, the EPP clients could be successfully installed from their local repository.

## Notes
- The EPP Client naming convention is fixed and does not allow for custom modifications to the libraries or .deb packages.
- Future requests for different versioning for different OS versions may not be processed as the product roadmap does not accommodate such changes.
- It is recommended to use a naming convention that includes the OS version in the package name (e.g., `X.Y.Z~22.04` for Ubuntu 22.04 and `X.Y.Z~24.04` for Ubuntu 24.04) to avoid similar issues in the future.
