## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CG01xIAD
- **Case Number:** 412875
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the functionality of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client after upgrading their RHEL operating system from version 8.7 to 9.1. They sought clarification on whether the EPP client would continue to function post-upgrade and the proper procedure for upgrading both RHEL and the EPP client.

## Environment Details
- RHEL version: 8.7 (current), with plans to upgrade to 9.1
- EPP client version: 2106 installed on RHEL 8.7
- Customer environment: Airgapped

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Responded to the customerâ€™s inquiry regarding the upgrade process.
2. Explained the potential incompatibility of the EPP client with RHEL 9.1.
3. Recommended reinstalling a compatible version of the EPP client after the RHEL upgrade.
4. Provided information on the latest available EPP client version for RHEL 9.1 and confirmed the need for dependency management.

## Root Cause
The EPP client version 2106 is not compatible with RHEL 9.1 due to differences in builds between major RHEL versions (8.x vs. 9.x). The dependencies required for the EPP client also change with the OS upgrade, necessitating a reinstallation of the client.

## Solution
The customer was advised to:
- Reinstall a compatible version of the EPP client after upgrading to RHEL 9.1.
- Use the FAT client for RHEL 9.x builds, ensuring all dependencies are removed and replaced with the latest ones for RHEL 9.x.
- For upgrades within the same major release (e.g., RHEL 8.7 to 8.8 or 8.9), the existing EPP client may still function, but caution was advised regarding potential dependency issues.

## Notes
- It is crucial to verify compatibility of the EPP client with the specific RHEL version before performing an upgrade.
- Customers in airgapped environments should ensure they have access to the necessary installation files and dependencies for the EPP client prior to upgrading their OS.
