## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DaPDJIA3
- **Case Number:** 416211
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Lincolnshire Police
- **Contact Name:** Amir Azadpour
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to upgrade the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client software to the latest version. The upgrade jobs completed with failure, and after installing the client MSI, no devices were visible in the EEP client.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 5940
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the client MSI obtained from the portal.
2. Checked the upgrade jobs for any error messages or logs indicating the cause of failure.
3. Investigated potential issues related to missing certificates in the Windows Certificate Store.
4. Reviewed related Jira issues for known problems and solutions regarding certificate requirements.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to missing certificates in the Windows Certificate Store, which caused the EppNotifier and other components to fail signature checks.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a manual for deploying the client software via Intune, which included instructions on ensuring that the necessary certificates were installed in the Certificate Store.

## Notes
- Ensure that all required certificates are present in the Windows Certificate Store before attempting client upgrades.
- Refer to the following Jira issues for detailed information on the required certificates:
  - [EPPSUPPORT-194](https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-194)
  - [EPPSUPPORT-586](https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-586)
- Future upgrades should include a verification step for certificate presence to prevent similar issues.
