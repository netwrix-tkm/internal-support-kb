- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.8.0.0 (current), 5.9.2.0 (planned upgrade)

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the compatibility of their existing clients with the planned upgrade of the EPP Server from version 5.8.0.0 to 5.9.2.0. They specifically wanted to know if the RHEL and Windows clients would be affected during and after the upgrade.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.8.0.0
- **Windows Client Version:** 5.9.1.7 (Windows Server 2019)
- **RHEL Client Version:** 2.1.0.6 (RHEL 8.7)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the planned upgrade of the EPP Server to version 5.9.2.0.
2. Addressed customer concerns regarding the compatibility of existing clients during the server upgrade.
3. Clarified that the RHEL client was already on the latest version and would not require any changes.
4. Provided information on how to upgrade Windows clients directly from the console.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's uncertainty about the backward compatibility of the clients with the new server version. There was a need for clarification on whether the existing clients would continue to function properly during and after the server upgrade.

## Solution
The support engineer confirmed that:
- The existing Windows clients (5.8.0.0) would be able to communicate with the upgraded server (5.9.2.0) without any issues.
- The RHEL client was already on the latest version and would not be affected by the server upgrade.
- The customer was advised to proceed with the upgrade of the EPP Server and then schedule the upgrade for the Windows clients.

The customer acknowledged the information and confirmed that they had no further questions, allowing the ticket to be closed.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly about backward compatibility when customers are planning upgrades.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the current versions of their clients to avoid confusion during upgrade processes.
- Document any specific upgrade paths or considerations for future reference, especially when dealing with mixed environments (Windows and RHEL).
