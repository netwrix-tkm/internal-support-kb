## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fu0MUIAZ
- **Case Number:** 421316
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Rheinmetall Vehicles, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Dennis Robinson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client installation via Intune was successful, but the clients were not appearing in the Computers list on the EPP Server. The customer was able to uninstall the client using Intune and install it with the correct MSI file, but faced difficulties confirming the correct server connection.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved client installations managed through Microsoft Intune.
- The EPP Server was not displaying the newly installed clients.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the EPP client on the client computer through Intune.
2. Confirmed that the correct MSI file was used for installation.
3. Attempted to check server connectivity and configuration settings.
4. Discussed the use of the zap tool for uninstallation, which was not deployed via Intune.

## Root Cause
The root cause identified was that the Intune installation only worked for fresh installs or for computers where the zap tool was used to uninstall the EPP client. The zap tool, however, could not be deployed through Intune and needed to be executed manually.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually using the zap tool to uninstall the EPP client from the affected computers before performing a fresh installation via Intune. This ensured that the clients were correctly registered on the EPP Server.

## Notes
- The zap tool must be manually executed on any client that previously had the EPP client installed to ensure proper installation via Intune.
- Future installations via Intune should consider the state of the client machines and whether the zap tool has been used for uninstallation to avoid similar issues.
