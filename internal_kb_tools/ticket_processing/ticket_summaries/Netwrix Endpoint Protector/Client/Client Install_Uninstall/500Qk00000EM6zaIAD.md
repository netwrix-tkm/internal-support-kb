## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the EPP client from a machine. The uninstaller script was stuck at the message "No product code was found" and did not complete the uninstallation process. Although the EPP client was not visible in the Control Panel, its icon remained in the System Tray, and the machine was still shown as licensed and connected in the EPP console.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a machine with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client installed.
- The specific version of the EPP client was not provided.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run the EPP uninstaller script.
2. Checked the Control Panel for the presence of the EPP client.
3. Verified the EPP console to confirm the machine's licensing and connection status.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it appears that remnants of the EPP client were still present on the machine, preventing the uninstaller script from completing successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running a specific tool designed for cleaning up the EPP client remnants from the machine. After executing the tool, the customer was instructed to restart the system, which successfully completed the uninstallation process.

## Notes
- Ensure that any remnants of the EPP client are completely removed before attempting to uninstall in the future.
- If the uninstaller script fails, consider using a dedicated cleanup tool to assist with the removal process.
- Always verify the licensing and connection status in the EPP console to understand the current state of the client on the machine.
