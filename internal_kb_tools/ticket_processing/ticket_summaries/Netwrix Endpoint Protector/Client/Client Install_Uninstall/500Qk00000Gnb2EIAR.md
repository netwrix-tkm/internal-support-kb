- **Case Number:** 423360
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** axlnetsecurity
- **Contact Name:** Leo Gevaerd
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer is testing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector product and seeks guidance on deploying it to Windows and Mac devices using JumpCloud as their Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. They noted that while the documentation covers configuration profiles for Jamf, JumpCloud does not provide a similar option and typically requires mobileconfig files for profile deployment.

## Environment Details
- **MDM Solution:** JumpCloud
- **Target Platforms:** Windows and Mac devices

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing documentation related to configuration profiles for Jamf.
2. Clarified the capabilities and limitations of JumpCloud in relation to mobileconfig file deployment.
3. Discussed potential alternatives for deploying the product using JumpCloud.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of support for mobileconfig file generation within JumpCloud, which is necessary for deploying configuration profiles for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector on the specified platforms.

## Solution
The customer was informed that they would need to create the necessary mobileconfig files manually or explore other deployment methods compatible with JumpCloud. They decided to postpone further assistance until they are ready to proceed with the deployment later in the year.

## Notes
- The customer indicated they would raise another ticket if they require further assistance in the future.
- It is important to note that JumpCloud's limitations regarding mobileconfig files may affect deployment strategies for other customers using similar MDM solutions.
