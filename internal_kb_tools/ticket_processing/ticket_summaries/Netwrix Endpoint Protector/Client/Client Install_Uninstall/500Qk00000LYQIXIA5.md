- **Case Number:** 434865
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Optics 1
- **Contact Name:** Gregg Monagle
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after creating an OS image that appeared as a clone for the Endpoint Protector Client, the agents on those PCs were not properly reporting to the server console. Only one of the PCs created from that image was visible in the console at any given time.

## Environment Details
- Approximately 50 PCs were affected by the issue.
- The issue began with the deployment of new images.
- The customer did not utilize the clone support setting in Endpoint Protector because the image was not an actual clone.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer updated the serial number of the C drive on one PC, which seemed to help.
2. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
3. The customer was advised to uninstall the Endpoint Protector Client using a silent uninstall script.
4. The customer created a snapshot of the EPP server and applied a product functionality update from version 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.1.
5. The customer attempted to remove the EPP client from the clone machines.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the improper handling of the OS image, which resulted in multiple PCs sharing the same fingerprinting information. This led to conflicts in reporting to the server console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Uninstalling the Endpoint Protector Client from the clone machines.
- Upgrading the Endpoint Protector to version 5.9.4.1, which included necessary updates to improve functionality and compatibility.

## Notes
- Ensure that the clone support setting is utilized when creating images for Endpoint Protector to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to verify that each machine has unique identifiers to prevent conflicts in reporting.
- The customer reported that everything was functioning correctly after the resolution and requested to keep the case open for a short period for monitoring.
