## Problem Description
The customer reported that after successfully installing the Netwrix agent on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine, the agent was not appearing in the console or device list.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
- Network: The installation was performed on a machine without an internet connection.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation process of the Netwrix agent on the Ubuntu machine.
2. Identified that the installation was attempted in an environment lacking internet connectivity.
3. Confirmed that some required packages could not be downloaded from the targeted URLs during the installation process, leading to errors.
4. Provided guidance on the correct installation procedure for the client on Ubuntu OS.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the installation of the Netwrix agent on a machine without internet access, which prevented the necessary packages from being downloaded, resulting in the agent not being properly configured or registered in the console.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer on how to perform the client installation correctly on Ubuntu OS. This included ensuring that all required packages were available locally or that the installation was conducted in an environment with internet access.

## Notes
- For future installations of the Netwrix agent on Ubuntu or similar environments, ensure that all dependencies and packages are available locally if the machine does not have internet access.
- Consider providing documentation or a checklist for offline installations to prevent similar issues.
