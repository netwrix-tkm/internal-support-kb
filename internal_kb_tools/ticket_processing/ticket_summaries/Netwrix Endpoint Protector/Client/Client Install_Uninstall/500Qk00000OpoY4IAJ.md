- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OpoY4IAJ
- **Case Number:** 444172
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FFS Film- & Fernseh-Synchron GmbH MÃ¼nchen + Berlin
- **Contact Name:** Robert Ludemann
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (EPP Server), 3.0.4.1006 (EPP Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the EPP client fails to connect to the EPP server when installed on a Mac with a system-wide HTTPS proxy enabled, despite the local subnet being excluded from proxying.

## Environment Details
- **Mac Model:** Studio M2
- **Operating System:** macOS Sonoma 14.7.5
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **EPP Client Version:** 3.0.4.1006
- **Network Configuration:** Both the Mac and EPP server are in the same subnet, which is excluded from the proxy settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the EPP server is accessible via a web browser from the affected Mac.
2. Attempted to install the EPP client with the system-wide HTTPS proxy enabled.
3. Observed that the installation completed without errors, but the client displayed "N/A" for most settings and failed to connect to the server.
4. Disabled the system proxy and reinstalled the EPP client, which successfully established a connection to the server.
5. Tested the installation process on multiple Mac Studio devices running macOS Sonoma to confirm reproducibility.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being specific to the installation process of the EPP client in the presence of an active system-wide HTTPS proxy. The proxy settings interfere with the initial connection setup required by the client during installation.

## Solution
The resolution involved implementing a workaround where the customer temporarily disables the system proxy before installing the EPP client. After the installation is complete and the client has successfully connected to the server, the proxy can be re-enabled without affecting the established connection.

## Notes
- It is recommended to document this workaround for future reference and to inform other customers facing similar issues.
- Support suggested using a fake proxy configuration during installation as an alternative workaround.
- The issue has been escalated to the product and development teams for further investigation and potential bug fixes, as it impacts deployment in proxy environments.
