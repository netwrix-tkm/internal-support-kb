## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Gshy4IAB
- **Case Number:** 423581
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Porter Hedges LLP
- **Contact Name:** Kenneth Haass
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client from a computer. Despite following the correct procedure to initiate the uninstallation, the client remained installed after multiple attempts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Client Version:** 12.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer navigated to the portal and accessed **System Configuration** > **Client Uninstall**.
2. The customer selected the specific client to uninstall.
3. The policy on the client was updated.
4. The customer rebooted the computer several times to ensure the changes took effect.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was determined that the standard uninstallation procedure was not effective in this instance.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the support technician provided the customer with a specialized tool known as the "zap tool." This tool is designed to forcibly remove the client from the system, which successfully resolved the uninstallation problem.

## Notes
- It is recommended to use the zap tool as a last resort when standard uninstallation methods fail.
- Ensure that all policies are correctly updated and that the client is rebooted after making changes to the configuration.
- Document any similar cases to identify patterns that may indicate underlying issues with the uninstallation process.
