- **Case Number:** 437768
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Klarna
- **Contact Name:** Deepti Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The Klarna team requested assistance in removing the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client from their computers without requiring an uninstall password, as their license had expired and the server would soon be terminated. They needed a solution that would also work for offline devices.

## Environment Details
- EPP client installed on both Windows and macOS computers.
- Multiple computers were offline, preventing standard uninstall actions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the requirement for a script to force remove the EPP client without a password.
2. Provided a Windows removal tool (`EppServicesZap64.zip`) that can be executed to remove the EPP client and all traces of it.
3. Provided a macOS script (`remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip`) that requires sudo privileges to run.
4. Ensured the customer agreed to the conditions of use for the provided tools and scripts.
5. Followed up with the customer to confirm successful execution of the scripts and tools.

## Root Cause
The issue arose from the expiration of the EPP license and the impending termination of the server, which would prevent the standard uninstall process from functioning correctly, especially for offline devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the following tools:
- For Windows: The `EppServicesZap64.zip` tool was shared, which removes the EPP client and all associated traces. The customer was instructed to allow at least one full minute for the tool to run.
- For macOS: The `remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip` script was provided, which needed to be executed with sudo privileges.

The customer confirmed that they were able to remove the EPP client from most devices, with a few remaining due to users being on vacation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the provided tools and scripts are only used by system administrators and are removed from end-user machines once no longer needed.
- The tools are intended for emergency situations and should not be distributed outside of the support context.
- Follow up with customers to confirm the successful execution of the provided solutions, especially when dealing with offline devices.
