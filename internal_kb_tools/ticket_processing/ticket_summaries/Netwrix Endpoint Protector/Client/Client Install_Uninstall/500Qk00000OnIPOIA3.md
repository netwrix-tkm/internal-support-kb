## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OnIPOIA3
- **Case Number:** 444030
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AED Vantage GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Steffen Prochnow
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 6.0.1.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to upgrade the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Agent to version 6.2.4 or remove the existing version (6.0.1.6) from a client machine. The error indicated that a required DLL was not found, and it was suspected that the old version was blocking a Windows 11 upgrade.

## Environment Details
- **Client Version:** 6.0.1.6
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 (implied by the upgrade issue)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered additional details and requested a screenshot from the customer.
2. Confirmed that the uninstallation/upgrade issue was occurring on only one PC.
3. Scheduled a remote session for further troubleshooting.
4. Conducted a remote session on May 8, 2025, to attempt uninstallation.
5. Utilized the ZAP tool to remove the EPP client completely.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as corrupt or invalid data associated with the existing EPP client installation, which prevented both the upgrade and uninstallation processes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using the ZAP tool to completely uninstall the EPP client from the affected machine. After the uninstallation, the client was removed successfully, allowing for the upgrade to proceed without further issues.

## Notes
- It is advisable to ensure that all client installations are up-to-date and free of corruption to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If encountering similar problems, consider using the ZAP tool as a first step in the uninstallation process for stubborn installations.
