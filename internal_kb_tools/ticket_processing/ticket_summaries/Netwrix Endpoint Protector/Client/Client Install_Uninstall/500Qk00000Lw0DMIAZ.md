## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Lw0DMIAZ
- **Case Number:** 435989
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Exodus Recovery
- **Contact Name:** Alex Le
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Client 6.2.3.1, Server 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about an easier method to delete old computers that have been offline for a certain amount of time, specifically those that have not communicated with the server in the past six months.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** On-prem server (air-gapped)
- **Client Version:** 6.2.3.1
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to clarify the impact of the issue on their business and what they were trying to accomplish.
2. The customer confirmed they were attempting to delete stale clients that had not been online for six months.
3. The customer reported that there was no way to filter clients by uptime.
4. The support engineer suggested sorting the clients by the "Last Seen" column in descending order to identify stale clients for deletion.
5. The customer was informed that even if a computer was mistakenly removed, it would be added back upon communication with the server.

## Root Cause
The lack of a filtering option for clients based on their last online status made it difficult for the customer to efficiently identify and delete old computers.

## Solution
The support engineer provided a workaround by advising the customer to sort the clients by the "Last Seen" column. The customer could then select the stale clients they wished to remove and click the delete option at the bottom of the page.

## Notes
- It is important to inform users that mistakenly deleting a computer will not result in permanent loss, as the computer will reappear once it communicates with the server again.
- Future enhancements to the product could consider adding filtering options based on client uptime to improve user experience.
