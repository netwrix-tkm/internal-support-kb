- **Account/Company:** Avantor
- **Contact Name:** Karthikeyan Ravi
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their enterprise license for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector (EPP) was set to expire on March 4, 2025. They planned to uninstall the EPP agent from workstations but were concerned about the functionality of a previously shared uninstallation tool and whether the uninstallation password configured in the CoSoSys portal could be unset.

## Environment Details
- **License Expiration Date:** March 4, 2025
- **Uninstallation Tool:** Provided by CoSoSys

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the expiration date of the enterprise license for CoSoSys.
2. Reviewed the functionality of the uninstallation tool shared by CoSoSys.
3. Investigated the possibility of unsetting the uninstallation password for the EPP agent.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's uncertainty regarding the functionality of the uninstallation tool after the license expiration and the presence of a configured uninstallation password.

## Solution
The EPP agent was successfully uninstalled using the tool provided by CoSoSys, which continued to function as expected despite the license expiration. The uninstallation password was not required due to the use of the tool.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the functionality of any third-party uninstallation tools prior to license expiration.
- Customers should be informed that uninstallation passwords may not be unset through standard procedures and should rely on provided tools for uninstallation when necessary.
