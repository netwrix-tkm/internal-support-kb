## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with uninstalling the DLP agent from client machines using SCCM or command-line methods, as they could not find relevant documentation.

## Environment Details
- The customer attempted to use the following commands for uninstallation:
  ```bash
  MsiExec.exe /x "{1529C7BD-20E9-4110-A11A-7243A1A4EBD3}" /qn PASSWORD="YourUninstallPassword"
  MsiExec.exe /x "{1529C7BD-20E9-4110-A11A-7243A1A4EBD3}" /quiet PASSWORD="YourUninstallPassword"
  Start-Process -FilePath "MsiExec.exe" -ArgumentList "/x '{1529C7BD-20E9-4110-A11A-7243A1A4EBD3}' /quiet PASSWORD='YourUninstallPassword'"
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with a link to the user manual article on "Client Software."
2. Supplied a VBScript for uninstallation along with a step-by-step guide and a video demonstration.
3. Followed up with the customer to confirm if the provided solution worked.
4. Investigated the issue of endpoints still appearing as online in the DLP console after uninstallation.

## Root Cause
The initial commands attempted by the customer were not effective in uninstalling the DLP agent. The issue was compounded by the DLP console not updating the status of the endpoints immediately after uninstallation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a VBScript for uninstallation, which successfully removed the DLP agent from the endpoints. The customer was instructed to run the script with administrative privileges, and they confirmed that the uninstallation was successful.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the DLP console reflects the correct status of endpoints after uninstallation, which may take some time to update.
- Customers should be advised to check the "Automatic Release License" settings if licenses are not being released for uninstalled endpoints.
- Future communications should include clear instructions on how to navigate the DLP console to manage endpoint statuses effectively.
