## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving an alert indicating that the `systemctl service epp-client-daemon-d` exited with code 4. They inquired about the correctness of the service name and noted that this error had occurred during an upgrade from version 1.5.8 to 2.4.2.1.

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered on a system running the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The alert message was: `"systemctl service epp-client-daemon-d exit code:4"`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer checked the status of the service using the command:
   ```bash
   pbrun systemctl status epp-client-daemon-d
   ```
   - Result: "Unit epp-client-daemon-d.service could not be found."
2. The exit code was verified using:
   ```bash
   echo $?
   ```
   - Result: Exit code 4.
3. The customer searched for any related processes using:
   ```bash
   ps ax | grep epp-client
   ```
   - Result: Found a process `/opt/cososys/sbin/epp-client-daemon` running.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a discrepancy in the service name. The correct service name is `epp-client-daemon`, not `epp-client-daemon-d`. The alert was triggered due to the system attempting to reference a non-existent service.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming the correct service name. The customer was advised to use `epp-client-daemon` for managing the service instead of `epp-client-daemon-d`. This clarification allowed the customer to manage the service without encountering the exit code 4 error.

## Notes
- Ensure that service names are verified before attempting to manage them with `systemctl` to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to document any changes in service names during upgrades to prevent confusion in the future.
