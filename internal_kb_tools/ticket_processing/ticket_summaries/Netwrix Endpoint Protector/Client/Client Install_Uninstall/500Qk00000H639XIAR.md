## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H639XIAR
- **Case Number:** 424054
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KEURO Besitz GmbH & Co. EDV-Dienstleistungs KG
- **Contact Name:** Benjamin Gutberlet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client using the command line interface (CLI). The uninstall command using `MsiExec` resulted in an error message indicating that a reboot was required to complete the setup, and the uninstall process was password protected by the server.

## Environment Details
- The client was deployed using a software deployment system that utilizes `MsiExec` commands for silent installation.
- The specific command used for installation was:
  ```bash
  MsiExec /I "%SRC%EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[a=172.20.1.37,n=0].msi"
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to uninstall the client using the command:
   ```bash
   MsiExec /X {ID of EP}
   ```
2. Received the error message: "The setup must update files or services that cannot be updated while the system is running. If you choose to continue, a reboot will be required to complete the setup."
3. Investigated the possibility of including the password in the uninstall command.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the password protection mechanism implemented by the server, which prevented the uninstallation process from proceeding without a reboot. The system was unable to update necessary files or services while running, leading to the error message.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
- The customer was advised to perform the uninstall command with the necessary password included. The correct syntax for including the password in the `MsiExec` command was provided, allowing the uninstallation to proceed without requiring a reboot.
- The final command format was confirmed to be:
  ```bash
  MsiExec /X {ID of EP} PASSWORD={your_password}
  ```

## Notes
- Ensure that the password for uninstallation is correctly specified in the command to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is recommended to check for any running services or processes related to the client before attempting uninstallation to minimize the chances of encountering the reboot requirement error.
- Document any specific configurations or settings related to password protection for future reference.
