## Problem Description
The customer, KKK, upgraded a computer to Ubuntu version 24.04 and requested an Endpoint Protector (EPP) agent compatible with this operating system.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04
- Previous EPP Server Version: 5.6.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided download links for EPP agents compatible with server versions 5.9.4.0 and 5.9.4.1.
2. Inquired about the server version to determine compatibility.
3. Informed the customer that there is no available agent for server version 5.6.0.
4. Recommended upgrading the server to the latest version (5.9.4.1) for compatibility with the new agent.
5. Suggested taking a snapshot of the endpoint protector appliance before attempting an upgrade.
6. Offered assistance with offline patches if the server was in an air-gapped environment.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's outdated server version (5.6.0), which was incompatible with the latest EPP agents designed for Ubuntu 24.04. There was no backward compatibility confirmed for such a significant version gap.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to upgrade their EPP server to version 5.9.4.1, which would allow them to use the EPP agent compatible with Ubuntu 24.04. The customer was provided with download links for the appropriate agents based on their server version.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the server version is up-to-date to maintain compatibility with the latest client agents.
- Always recommend taking a snapshot of the appliance before performing upgrades to allow for easy rollback in case of issues.
- For closed-network environments, be prepared to provide offline upgrade options if necessary.
