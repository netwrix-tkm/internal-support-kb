## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) agent on an Ubuntu machine.

## Environment Details
- The specific version of Ubuntu was not provided in the initial communication.
- The version of the EPP agent was also not specified.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team requested additional details from the customer, including:
   - Any error messages received during the installation process.
   - A screenshot of the error (if applicable).
   - The specific version of the Ubuntu OS and the EPP agent being used.
2. A meeting was scheduled for July 2, 2024, at 11:30 AM to perform live troubleshooting with the customer.
3. During the meeting, the support team and the customer attempted to install the EPP agent.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the installation failure was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was noted that the customer was requesting the EPP agent package for Ubuntu 24.04, which was not available at the time.

## Solution
- The EPP agent was successfully installed during the scheduled troubleshooting session.
- It was confirmed that the installation was completed, but the customer later requested the agent package specifically for Ubuntu 24.04, indicating that the current version was not compatible or available.

## Notes
- There is currently no EPP agent available for Ubuntu 24.04.
- Future requests for installations on Ubuntu should confirm the specific version of the OS to ensure compatibility with the available EPP agent packages.
- It is advisable to maintain clear communication regarding the versions of software and OS being used to avoid similar issues in the future.
