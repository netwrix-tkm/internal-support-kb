## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LRSFUIA5
- **Case Number:** 434546
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Helsing
- **Contact Name:** Kerem Sevil
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent installed on a macOS client (version 15.3). Although the agent status was shown as ONLINE in the dashboard, it indicated "Connected: NO" on the endpoint agent. The customer was advised to create a support ticket for assistance.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 15.3
- **Agent Version:** 5.9.4.1 (latest release)
- **VPN:** Active with TLS decryption enabled

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the agent and server were both running the latest version (5.9.4.1).
2. Confirmed the client status was ONLINE in the dashboard.
3. Investigated connectivity issues between the EPP server and EPP client.
4. The customer tested the connection by disabling the VPN, which allowed the EPP client to communicate with the server.
5. Suggested setting up an exception for the EPP client-server communication.

## Root Cause
The connectivity issue was identified as being caused by the VPN's TLS decryption settings, which were interfering with the communication between the EPP client and server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to set up a TLS decryption exception for the EPP client-server communication. This adjustment allowed the client to connect successfully to the server while the VPN was active.

## Notes
- Ensure that any VPN configurations do not interfere with the communication of security agents.
- For future cases, consider checking VPN settings as a potential cause of connectivity issues with endpoint protection solutions.
