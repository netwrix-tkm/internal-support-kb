## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Bdhl8IAB
- **Case Number:** 411442
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kannan International Pvt Ltd. (former BrainValley Software Private Limited)
- **Contact Name:** Vasanth Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported two critical issues with their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system:
1. **DLP License Issue:** The DLP license was installed on the client side but was not reflecting on the server despite full permissions being granted.
2. **Client-Server Connectivity:** Clients were unable to connect to the server, although policies were being updated according to log reports.

## Environment Details
- The issues were occurring in a client-server setup using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed log reports to confirm that policies were being updated.
2. Attempted to uninstall and reconfigure the client on the affected machine.
3. Defined an uninstall password to remove the license from the client machine, but encountered invalidation issues with the password.
4. Scheduled remote sessions for further investigation and troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a failure in the client-server communication, likely due to improper configuration or issues with the client installation that prevented the license from being recognized on the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Reinstalling the Endpoint Protector client on the affected machines, which allowed the DLP license to be recognized correctly on the server and restored client-server connectivity.

## Notes
- Ensure that the uninstall password is correctly configured and communicated to avoid invalidation issues during uninstallation.
- For future cases, verify client-server connectivity and license recognition after any client installation or reconfiguration.
- It is advisable to document any specific configurations or settings that may affect the DLP system's performance and compliance monitoring.
