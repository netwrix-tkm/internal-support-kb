## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N1cnZIAR
- **Case Number:** 439025
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hub International Limited
- **Contact Name:** Ebenezer Brew
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The IT team at Hub International was unable to install the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client on their terminal servers and some laptops. This issue persisted despite following the same installation process as outlined in a previous support ticket (00417457). Additionally, some terminal servers that had EPP installed were no longer connecting to the console.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server 2019, Windows 10, and Windows 11.
- **EPP Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** Ramon Torres from Netwrix Technical Support contacted the customer to gather details about the number of affected devices.
2. **Remote Session:** A remote session was scheduled where the customer reported approximately 50 computers were experiencing the issue.
3. **Tool Usage:** The customer uploaded the zap tool and was guided through the process of removing the old EPP client from one server.
4. **Installation Attempt:** The customer successfully installed the EPP client on the server without issues.
5. **Plan for Remaining Devices:** The customer agreed to use the zap tool only as an administrator and planned to remove the EPP client from the remaining servers and laptops.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the installation issues was identified as the EPP installer pointing to an outdated folder that was no longer in use, despite the download being fresh from the console. This was compounded by a previous licensing issue that caused devices to go offline or be removed from the console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Using the zap tool to remove the old EPP client from the affected devices.
- Successfully reinstalling the EPP client on the server during the remote session.
- The customer confirmed they would follow the same process for the remaining 49 devices.

## Notes
- The zap tool is intended for administrative use only; users should not utilize it.
- There is no specific documentation for mass deployment of the zap tool or the EPP client, but general msiexec documentation may be helpful for advanced users attempting to create deployment scripts.
- The case was confirmed resolved by the customer, and the ticket was subsequently closed.
