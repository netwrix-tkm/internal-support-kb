## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where new Windows clients were unable to register with the internal virtual appliance. Despite creating a new MSI installer with the updated server name and installing the necessary certificates, the clients still failed to register.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved the registration of Windows clients to a virtual appliance.
- MSI log files were available but did not provide clarity on the registration failure.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a new MSI installer with the updated server name.
2. Installed the client registration certificate.
3. Reviewed MSI log files for errors related to client registration.
4. Identified that the client registration certificate was enabled by accident, despite the customer not using a certificate.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the accidental enabling of the client registration certificate, which was not required for the customer's setup. This led to a conflict that prevented the new clients from registering successfully.

## Solution
Disabling the client registration certificate resolved the issue. The customer was instructed to re-add the custom server certificate after it was reset during the troubleshooting process. Once the certificate was re-added, the customer confirmed that the registration issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that the client registration certificate is only enabled when necessary to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the server certificate settings after making changes to the client registration configuration.
- Follow up with the customer to confirm that all settings are functioning correctly after adjustments.
