## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OPxS5IAL
- **Case Number:** 443117
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** West Texas A&M University
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Lauterbach
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client after removing enforcement of all policies from their server. They were unable to uninstall the client due to not having access to the server to set an uninstall password, and no one remembered the old password.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the operating system on which the EPP Client software was installed (Windows).
2. Provided the customer with a disclaimer for the internal zap tool required for uninstallation.
3. Obtained written agreement from the customer to use the zap tool responsibly.
4. Sent the EppServiceZap64 tool to the customer for removal of the client.

## Root Cause
The inability to uninstall the client was due to the removal of the server that managed the policies and the lack of knowledge of the uninstall password, which was necessary for the uninstallation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the EppServiceZap64 tool, which is an internal tool designed for extraordinary situations. The customer was instructed to extract and run the tool as an administrator on the target computers to successfully remove the client.

## Notes
- The zap tool should only be used in extraordinary situations and must be deleted from each machine after use.
- The customer must ensure that the tool is not shared with any third party.
- Future customers facing similar issues should be reminded to keep track of uninstall passwords and server configurations to avoid such complications.
