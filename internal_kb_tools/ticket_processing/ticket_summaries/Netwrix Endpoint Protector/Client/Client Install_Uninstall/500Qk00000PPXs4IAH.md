- **Case Number:** 445802
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IGOS GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Ivy Nguy
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer configured a new EPP Server but found that the clients on their devices were still connected to the old server. Attempts to reinstall the agent did not update the server connection settings, and the customer lacked access to the old server dashboard for remote uninstallation or configuration updates.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Endpoint Protector (EPP) agents on client devices.
- The old server dashboard was inaccessible, preventing remote management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to reinstall the EPP agent, which did not overwrite the old configurations.
2. Explored options for uninstalling the agent without access to the old server dashboard.
3. Considered manually deleting the agent directory, which is not recommended.
4. Reviewed the possibility of using the "SetServerIP" tool to update server settings.

## Root Cause
The EPP agent retains its configuration, including the server address, unless it is fully uninstalled or reconfigured. Reinstalling the agent does not automatically update the server connection settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using the "SetServerIP" tool provided by Netwrix to update the server address on each client device. This allowed the clients to connect to the new EPP server without needing to uninstall the agent. Alternatively, a clean uninstall of the existing agent followed by a reinstall of the new agent package could also achieve the desired outcome. The steps for a clean uninstall included:
1. Uninstalling the EPP agent using the official uninstaller.
2. Rebooting the client device.
3. Installing the EPP agent package generated by the new server.

## Notes
- Manually deleting the agent directory is not recommended, as it may leave behind residual files or registry entries that could interfere with future installations.
- For large deployments, consider using a script or software deployment tool to automate the uninstall and reinstall process or the SetServerIP tool.
- If issues arise during the uninstall process (e.g., missing uninstaller, password protection), contact Netwrix Support for assistance.
