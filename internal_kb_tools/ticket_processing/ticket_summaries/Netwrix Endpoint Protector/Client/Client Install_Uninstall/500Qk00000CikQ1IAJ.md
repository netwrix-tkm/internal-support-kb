## Problem Description
The customer, Brea Networks, reported difficulties in uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client from their systems. They had received a command prompt for uninstallation but were unable to locate the necessary executable file.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client installed on multiple computers.
- The customer was attempting to uninstall the client remotely.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer left a voicemail detailing their issue, referencing a previous ticket and requesting assistance.
2. A support engineer contacted the customer to clarify the issue and confirm whether the uninstall command had been received.
3. The support team provided guidance on using the command prompt for uninstallation but needed the specific executable file name and path.
4. The support team confirmed that the customer did not have the MSI file but only an EXE and a script for uninstallation.
5. A silent uninstall script was provided to the customer, along with instructions for its use.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the customer's inability to locate the executable file necessary for the uninstallation process. They were also unaware that the uninstall command had not been effective in removing the EPP client from their systems.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a silent uninstall script for the EPP client. The script was designed to be run via the command line or through a Group Policy Object (GPO). The customer was instructed to run the script with administrative privileges and to reboot the machines after executing the uninstall command.

## Notes
- The customer confirmed that the script would only be used by administrators and would not be shared with third parties.
- It is important to ensure that the correct executable or script is provided for uninstallation to avoid similar issues in the future.
- For future cases, ensure that customers are aware of the need for administrative privileges when running uninstall scripts.
