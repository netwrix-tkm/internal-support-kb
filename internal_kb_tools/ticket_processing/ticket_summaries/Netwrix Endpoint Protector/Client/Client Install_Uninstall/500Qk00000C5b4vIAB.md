## Problem Description
The customer reported that the uninstall script for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector on macOS was not functioning correctly and requested a new script in `.sh` format.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on macOS systems where the Endpoint Protector agent was installed.
- The customer attempted to use multiple fresh copies of the `.tar` file for the uninstall process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team requested additional details about the script being used and the specific error messages encountered.
2. The customer was instructed to download the installation package for the EPP client from the EPP UI and run the `remove-epp` script as an administrator (using `sudo`).
3. The customer reported receiving an error even after multiple attempts with fresh copies of the installation package.
4. The support team provided a different version of the removal tool and requested the customer to test it and reboot the client machine afterward.
5. The customer confirmed that the provided script did not fully uninstall the EPP agent, which remained visible in the console.

## Root Cause
The original uninstall script was not functioning as intended, possibly due to changes in the macOS environment or updates to the Endpoint Protector software that affected the uninstall process.

## Solution
The support team provided a new version of the removal tool specifically designed to address the uninstall issue. After testing this new tool, the customer confirmed that it resolved the problem, allowing for the successful uninstallation of the EPP agent.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the correct version of the removal tool is used, as different versions may have varying compatibility with the macOS environment.
- Future cases should consider verifying the macOS version and any recent updates that may affect the functionality of uninstall scripts.
- Always recommend rebooting the client machine after running uninstall scripts to ensure all components are properly removed.
