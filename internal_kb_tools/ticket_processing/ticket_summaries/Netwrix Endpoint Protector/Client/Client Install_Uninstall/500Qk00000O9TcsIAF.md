## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while attempting to install the Netwrix Endpoint Protector application on a client laptop, indicating that a conflicting software was already installed on the system.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a testing device used by the customer.
- The specific error message stated that the application was already installed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made with Umesh Patil via 3CX, who requested remote session details for troubleshooting.
2. A Zoom meeting was scheduled, but Umesh did not attend the session after waiting for 30 minutes.
3. Follow-up attempts were made to connect with Umesh for troubleshooting, but he was unavailable.
4. After multiple attempts to schedule a session, a remote connection was finally established.
5. During the remote session, it was determined that a removal tool was needed to address the conflicting software.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the installation issue was identified as the presence of conflicting software that was already installed on the client system, preventing the installation of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector application.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by utilizing the Zapp tool, which is an internal tool provided to customers for extraordinary situations. Umesh was instructed to use the tool as an administrator and to delete it from the machine after use.

## Notes
- The Zapp tool should only be used in extraordinary situations and must not be shared with third parties.
- Ensure that the customer agrees to the disclaimer regarding the use of the Zapp tool before providing it.
- Future support technicians should be aware of the potential for conflicting software to cause installation issues and may need to provide removal tools as necessary.
