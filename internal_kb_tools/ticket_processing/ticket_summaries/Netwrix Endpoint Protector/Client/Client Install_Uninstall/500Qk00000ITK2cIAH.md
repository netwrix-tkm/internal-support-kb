- **Case Number:** 427422
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Jukshio
- **Contact Name:** Naveen Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with an endpoint where the EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform) sensor was installed. The sensor was pointing to an old server that was no longer reachable, causing restrictions on uploads from the endpoint. The customer attempted to uninstall the sensor but encountered an incorrect password prompt.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, Ubuntu, MAC (specific OS not mentioned)
- **EPP Sensor Status:** Incorrect IP address pointing to an old server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to uninstall the EPP sensor from the laptop.
2. Encountered a prompt indicating that the password for the EPP was incorrect.
3. Customer reached out for assistance in recovering the password or finding an alternative uninstallation method.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the EPP sensor was configured to communicate with an outdated server, which was no longer accessible. This misconfiguration led to the inability to authenticate the uninstallation process due to the incorrect password prompt.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using the Zapp tool to remove the EPP sensor from the endpoint. This method bypassed the need for the password and successfully uninstalled the sensor.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP sensor is configured to point to the correct server to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If encountering password issues during uninstallation, consider using the Zapp tool as an alternative method for removal.
- Always verify server connectivity and configuration settings before attempting uninstallation of security software.
