- **Case Number:** 412456
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 14.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Neoway, requested a method to deploy Windows machines without the need for parameters to be included in square brackets within the installer. Their deployment tool does not support the use of these characters, and they needed an alternative way to specify server credentials during installation.

## Environment Details
- Deployment tool used by Neoway does not support square brackets in command parameters.
- The installation involves the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's deployment requirements and limitations regarding parameter formatting.
2. Suggested a command line approach using `msiexec` to install the client without square brackets.
3. Provided an example command for the customer to adapt:
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /i "msiInstallerPath" WSIP="EPP_server_IP" WSPORT="443" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress
   ```
4. Instructed the customer to rename the MSI installer and configure the EPP server IP/Domain and default port as command line arguments.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's deployment tool's inability to process command line parameters that included square brackets, which are typically used to denote optional parameters in command syntax.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing a command line installation method that does not require square brackets. The customer successfully executed the adapted command in Command Prompt, allowing them to deploy the Windows clients with the necessary server credentials.

## Notes
- Ensure that any deployment tools used in the future are compatible with the command line syntax required for installations.
- When providing command line instructions, clarify any character limitations that may affect the deployment process.
