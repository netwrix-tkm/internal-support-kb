- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli Sembiring
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 3.0.4.1 (initially reported), 3.0.4.3 (resolved version)

## Problem Description
The customer reported two main issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) Client installed on macOS 12.7 (Monterey):
1. Client notifications were not displayed when Data Control (DC) or Content Aware Protection (CAP) policy violations occurred.
2. The client connection status was showing as "not connected," despite receiving policy updates from the server.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 12.7 (Monterey)
- **EPP Client Version:** 3.0.4.1
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the presence of the EPP icon on the computer.
2. Restarted the computer and reinstalled the EPP client.
3. Ensured full disk access was granted to the EPP Client and that the DPI certificate was imported into the keychain.
4. Checked the notification settings on the Mac to ensure the EPP client was allowed.
5. Verified network connectivity to the server on port 443.
6. Investigated if "Increased Communication Security" was selected during installation; it was confirmed that it was not.
7. Reviewed logs for errors related to the EPP Notifier.
8. Suggested testing with a USB device to check if policy updates were effective.
9. Provided a patch for the EPP client and instructed the customer to install version 3.0.4.3.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the EPP Notifier failing to start on the affected Mac, which prevented notifications from being displayed. The logs indicated an error related to the notifier not functioning correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by installing the updated EPP client version 3.0.4.3, which included fixes for the notifier functionality. After installation, the connection and CAP issues were resolved, and notifications began to display correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP client is always updated to the latest version to avoid similar issues.
- When troubleshooting, confirm that no other endpoint management or antivirus software is interfering with the EPP client.
- If issues persist after reinstalling, consider checking for specific errors in the logs that may indicate underlying problems with the notifier or client configuration.
