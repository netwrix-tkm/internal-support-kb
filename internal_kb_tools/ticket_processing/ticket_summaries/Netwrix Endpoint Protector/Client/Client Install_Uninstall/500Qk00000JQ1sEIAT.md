- **Case Number:** 429683
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AIQON SERVIÇOS EM INFORMATICA LTDA – Reseller
- **Contact Name:** João Pedro Silva Gomes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Trial Version

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the DLP Appliance allocated to their hypervisor needs to remain powered on at all times. They reported that turning off the appliance results in a new IP address being assigned, which causes the installed agent to lose communication with the console.

## Environment Details
- **Appliance Type:** DLP Appliance
- **Deployment:** Hypervisor-based
- **Version:** Trial version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's question regarding the necessity of keeping the appliance powered on.
2. Confirmed that turning off the appliance leads to a new IP address assignment.
3. Provided guidance on the implications of the appliance being turned off and the resulting communication issues with the agent.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the dynamic IP address assignment that occurs when the DLP Appliance is powered off and then back on. This behavior is typical for virtual appliances that do not have a static IP configuration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the DLP Appliance should remain powered on to maintain a consistent IP address. If the appliance must be turned off, it is recommended to configure a static IP address to prevent the loss of communication between the agent and the console.

## Notes
- It is advisable for customers to configure static IP addresses for appliances in production environments to avoid communication issues.
- Customers using trial versions should be made aware of the limitations and behaviors of the software, especially regarding network configurations.
