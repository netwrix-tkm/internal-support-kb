## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HC5zsIAD
- **Case Number:** 424373
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 7.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in hiding all processes and services of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client on user PCs. While they successfully hid the system tray icon and processes in Task Manager, they were unable to hide the services listed in the Task Manager's Services section.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Client Version:** 7.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the system tray icon was hidden successfully.
2. Verified that processes were hidden in Task Manager.
3. Attempted to find settings or configurations within the EPP client to hide services.
4. Explored documentation for any existing workarounds or settings related to service visibility.

## Root Cause
The inability to hide the services in Task Manager was due to the inherent design of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector software, which does not provide an option to hide services from the Services section in Task Manager.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing a workaround that involved modifying the service configuration settings. The support technician provided specific instructions to the customer on how to adjust these settings, which allowed the services to be effectively hidden from view in Task Manager.

## Notes
- Future requests for hiding services should be approached with the understanding that the default behavior of the software does not support this feature.
- It is advisable to document any workarounds provided to customers for similar requests to streamline future support efforts.
