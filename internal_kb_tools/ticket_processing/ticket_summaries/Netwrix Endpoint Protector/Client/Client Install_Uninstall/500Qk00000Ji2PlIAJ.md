## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while attempting to update laptops from Endpoint Protector version 5.6.11 to 6.2.4.1003 using Intune as their Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. Two laptops in the pilot group returned an exit code 1603, indicating that a conflicting application was interrupting the installation process.

2. They searched for and removed any titles containing "endpoint protector" from the registry.
3. The customer requested assistance to identify any leftover folders, files, or registry keys that could be causing the installation issue.

## Root Cause
The exit code 1603 typically indicates that there are remnants of previous installations or conflicting applications that prevent the new installation from proceeding. In this case, it was likely due to leftover files or registry entries that were not fully cleared.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the **Zap tool**, which is designed to help remove any leftover files, folders, or registry keys associated with previous installations of Endpoint Protector. After using the tool, the customer was able to successfully complete the installation of version 6.2.4.1003.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all remnants of previous installations are completely removed before attempting to install a new version of Endpoint Protector.
- For future cases involving exit code 1603, consider recommending the use of the Zap tool as a first step in troubleshooting installation issues.
