## Problem Description
The customer requested installers for Fedora 40 and Fedora 41 for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client.

## Environment Details
- The client environment is expected to have an internet connection, allowing for the installation of the software.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the installer link for Fedora 40:
   - [Fedora 40 Installer](https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_fedora_40_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz)
2. Confirmed with engineering regarding the availability of the Fedora 41 installer.
3. Engaged in email communication with the client to clarify their network setup (internet-connected vs. airgapped).
4. Created a product board request for the Fedora 41 installer after confirming the client's requirements.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was the unavailability of the Fedora 41 installer, which had not been requested by any customer prior to this case. The engineering team needed to be notified to create the build.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the installer for Fedora 40 and subsequently obtaining the installer for Fedora 41 from engineering. The link for Fedora 41 was later shared with the client:
- [Fedora 41 Installer](https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_fedora_41_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz)

## Notes
- Ensure that requests for Linux installers are raised via the product board for any distributions other than the commonly supported ones (e.g., Ubuntu 20/22/24 and RHEL 8.x and 9.x).
- Future requests for installers should confirm the client's network configuration to determine the appropriate installer type.
