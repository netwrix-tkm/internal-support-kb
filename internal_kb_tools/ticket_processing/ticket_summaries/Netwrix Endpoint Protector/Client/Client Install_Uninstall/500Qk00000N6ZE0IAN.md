- **Case Number:** 439360
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Los Angeles Unified School District
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Madrigal
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Daniel Madrigal, reported issues while attempting to push the Endpoint Protector client through Microsoft Intune. Although the software was installed on 10 devices, they were not appearing in the "computer" section of the management console. The customer requested troubleshooting instructions for the Intune rollout and clarification on scan speeds related to policy scans.

## Environment Details
- **Management Tool:** Microsoft Intune
- **Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with the Microsoft MDM Intune deployment guide link.
2. Clarified the difference between CAP and eDiscovery policies regarding scan speeds.
3. Explained that the duration of eDiscovery scans depends on factors such as storage size, number of files, and the number of computers involved.
4. Inquired about the specific policies the customer was referring to for scan speeds.
5. Addressed the customer's question regarding the limitation of exportable scan results.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to a lack of visibility of the installed Endpoint Protector clients in the Intune management console, which could be attributed to configuration settings or synchronization issues between Intune and the Endpoint Protector software.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by providing the customer with the Intune MDM deployment guide, which included instructions for properly rolling out the Endpoint Protector client. Additionally, the customer was informed about the settings that could affect the visibility of devices in the management console.

## Notes
- The maximum number of records returned in a report can be adjusted in the Device Control settings under Global Settings.
- The speed of eDiscovery scans is influenced by the performance of the individual computers rather than the Netwrix servers.
- For future inquiries regarding unrelated issues, it is recommended to open a separate support ticket to ensure clarity and proper tracking.
