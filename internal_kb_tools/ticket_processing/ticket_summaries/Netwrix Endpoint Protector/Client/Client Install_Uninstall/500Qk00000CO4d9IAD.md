- **Case Number:** 413311
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Texas Christian University
- **Contact Name:** A Counts
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Windows Server version: 5.6.3.1, Windows Client version: 5.6.11

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues uninstalling the Endpoint Protector agent from their server group. Attempts to uninstall via both the EPP portal and locally on the machine were unsuccessful, with the local uninstall option being grayed out.

## Environment Details
- Operating Systems affected: Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019.
- Client and server versions in use: 
  - Windows Server version: 5.6.3.1
  - Windows Client version: 5.6.11

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the operating systems where the issue was occurring.
2. Verified that the EPP clients were communicating with the server and were showing as "Online."
3. Requested confirmation of the server and client versions from the customer.
4. Provided a tool for uninstalling the clients, contingent upon the customer's written confirmation of its use.
5. Sent the download link for the removal tool after receiving the customer's confirmation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the uninstall issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was noted that the uninstall option was grayed out, which typically indicates permission issues or that the application is still actively running or protected by security settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a specialized removal tool (EppServicesZap.zip) designed for uninstalling the Endpoint Protector clients. The customer confirmed that the tool would only be used by an administrator and would be removed after use. The customer successfully used the tool to uninstall the clients.

## Notes
- Ensure that the removal tool is only used by authorized personnel and is removed from the system after use to prevent unauthorized access.
- Future cases should verify if the application is still running or if there are any security settings preventing uninstallation before providing the removal tool.
