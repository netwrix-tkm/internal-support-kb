- **Case Number:** 428023
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Manpreet Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Manpreet Singh, requested assistance in creating a role that would allow their helpdesk team to enable Stealthy DPI within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They were unable to find an existing role that provided this specific access.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was looking for role-based access control for the Stealthy DPI feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing roles and permissions within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
2. Communicated with the customer regarding the limitations of role creation for specific features.
3. Suggested that full control access to the Device Control module would be necessary for enabling Stealthy DPI.

## Root Cause
The inability to create a specific role for enabling Stealthy DPI was due to the design of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which only allows granting full access to entire modules rather than granular permissions for individual features.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that to enable Stealthy DPI, they would need to grant full control access to the Device Control module. This approach would allow the helpdesk team to enable Stealthy DPI, albeit with the caveat that it would provide them with complete access to all functionalities within the Device Control module.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that granting full access to modules may lead to broader permissions than intended.
- Future requests for specific role creation should be assessed against the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to avoid similar confusion.
