## Problem Description
The client requested best practices for deploying the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client on equipment, specifically inquiring about deployment via Group Policy Object (GPO) and third-party applications. They also sought guidance on how to uninstall the client from the system.

   - Forcing a group policy update on the target devices.
2. Shared references for third-party application deployment, specifically for Microsoft Intune and JAMF.
3. Explained the uninstallation process, both through the server and locally using the `msiexec` command.

## Root Cause

- Step-by-step guidance for GPO deployment.
- References for third-party application deployment.
- Instructions for uninstalling the client. 
The client confirmed that the deployment was successful on several computers.

## Notes
- Ensure that the client is aware of the need to manually restart devices if automatic restarts do not occur after policy updates.
- Future inquiries regarding deployment should reference the provided links and instructions to streamline the support process.
- Maintain updated documentation for deployment methods to assist clients effectively.
