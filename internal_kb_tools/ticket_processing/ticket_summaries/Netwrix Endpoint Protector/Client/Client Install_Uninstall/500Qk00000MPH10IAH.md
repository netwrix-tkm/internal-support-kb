## Problem Description
The customer, Sebastian Boe√ü, reported difficulties in completely uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client from a user's computer. The issue arose while attempting to update old client agents to the latest version, as the installation process was aborted due to conflicts likely caused by remnants of an old version of the software.

## Environment Details
- The client machine had an old version of Endpoint Protector that was not removed completely.
- There were no similar software products installed on the client machine that could cause conflicts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the documentation for uninstalling the EPP client.
2. Attempted to uninstall the EPP client using standard uninstallation methods.
3. Checked for any conflicting software that might be causing the installation to abort.
4. Communicated with the client to gather more details about the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incomplete uninstallation of the previous version of the Endpoint Protector client, which led to conflicts during the installation of the new version.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a complete uninstallation of the EPP client followed by a fresh installation of the latest version. This process ensured that all remnants of the old version were removed, allowing the new installation to proceed without conflicts.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all previous versions of the software are completely uninstalled before attempting to install a new version to avoid conflicts.
- If similar issues arise in the future, consider using specialized uninstallation tools or scripts that can remove stubborn remnants of software installations.
