- **Account/Company:** Build King Holdings
- **Contact Name:** Willy Lam
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after stopping the services of Endpoint Protector, some client PCs still had the application installed. They requested a solution to completely remove the client from these PCs.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved multiple client PCs that had the Endpoint Protector application installed but were no longer in use.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer initially sought a solution that required action on a single PC.
2. Netwrix support suggested contacting them for each affected computer if the recommended solution was not pursued.
3. The support team communicated with the customer to schedule a remote support session.
4. The Zap Tool was identified as a potential solution for removing the client.

## Root Cause
The issue arose because the customer had not removed the client software from the PCs after stopping the Endpoint Protector services, leading to residual installations.

## Solution
The support technician ran the Zap Tool on the affected computer to remove the Endpoint Protector client completely. After the removal, the Zap Tool was deleted from the system.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Zap Tool is used only when necessary, as it is a powerful utility for removing applications.
- Future cases should confirm whether the client software is still needed before stopping services to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to maintain a record of all installations and their statuses to facilitate easier management and removal in the future.
