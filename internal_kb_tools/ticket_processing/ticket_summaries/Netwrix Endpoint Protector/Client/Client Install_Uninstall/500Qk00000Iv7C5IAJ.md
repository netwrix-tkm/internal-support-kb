## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Iv7C5IAJ
- **Case Number:** 428488
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Company 3 Toronto
- **Contact Name:** Mark Carreira
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 13.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with uninstalling an older version of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) software from Windows 10 client machines. The uninstaller for the legacy version was unresponsive to requests from the admin server, prompting the need for a local uninstallation script.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Software Version:** Legacy Endpoint Protector client

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer requested a local script or uninstaller to remove the older EPP software.
2. A command for uninstalling the EPP client was provided to the customer:
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /x "path_to_msi" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0="your_uninstall_password" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn
   ```
3. The customer attempted to run the provided script but reported no changes and noted the absence of an uninstaller or .msi file in the program folder.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the unresponsive uninstaller of the legacy EPP software, which did not function correctly when invoked from the admin server. Additionally, the absence of an uninstaller or .msi file in the installation directory complicated the removal process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a command-line script to uninstall the EPP client locally. After executing the command, the customer confirmed that the uninstallation was successful, allowing them to proceed with installing the newer version of the software.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct path to the .msi file is specified in the uninstall command.
- It is advisable to verify the presence of the uninstaller or .msi file in the installation directory before attempting uninstallation.
- For future cases, consider providing additional guidance on using mass deployment tools for software uninstallation when dealing with multiple client machines.
