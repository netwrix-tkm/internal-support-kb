- **Case Number:** 436904
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AOK - Die Gesundheitskasse f√ºr Niedersachsen
- **Contact Name:** Stefan Nanninga
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with upgrading the client software from version 5.9.28 to 6.2.3.1. The upgrade consistently rolled back to the previous version, and attempts to uninstall the software for a fresh installation were unsuccessful.

## Environment Details
- Affected systems were running version 5.9.28 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client software.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to upgrade the client software using the console.
2. Tried upgrading using the MSI installer.
3. Attempted to uninstall the software via:
   - Console
   - Programs and Features
   - MSI installer
4. Considered manually removing the installation folder and deleting registry keys but sought a safer method first.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, the rollback behavior typically indicates that there may have been conflicts with existing files or registry entries that prevented the upgrade from completing successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the "zap tool," which is designed to completely remove the client software, including any residual files and registry entries that may have caused the upgrade to fail. This allowed for a clean installation of the new version.

## Notes
- It is recommended to use the zap tool for any future cases where a client upgrade fails and traditional uninstall methods do not work.
- Always ensure that any existing installations are fully removed before attempting to install a new version to avoid conflicts.
