## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while manually installing the EPP agent on a test device. The installation process did not recognize the certificates, indicating "NO" for both certificate availability and trust. Additionally, the device was not appearing on the console, with the connection status showing "NO" and no policies received.

## Environment Details
- Test device used for installation
- Certificates were manually installed
- Server IP and Port were configured correctly

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the EPP agent on the test device.
2. Checked the status of the certificates to confirm they were installed correctly.
3. Ensured that the Server IP and Port settings were accurate.
4. Attempted to refresh the console to see if the device would appear.
5. Assigned a Content Aware Protection policy to the test computer.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the certificates not being validated and trusted by the system prior to the assignment of the Content Aware Protection policy.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by assigning a Content Aware Protection policy to the test computer, which validated and trusted the certificates. After this step, the device was able to connect and appear on the console as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that certificates are properly validated and trusted before assigning policies to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the connection status and policy assignments after installation to confirm proper functionality.
