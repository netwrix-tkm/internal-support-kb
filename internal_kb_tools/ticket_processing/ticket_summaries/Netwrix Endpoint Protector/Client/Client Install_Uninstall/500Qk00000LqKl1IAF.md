- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported connection problems between a manually installed Linux agent and the administration console. Although the installation was successful, the computer did not appear in the console despite the firewall being disabled.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Linux
- **Installation Method:** Manual installation
- **Configuration:** Server IP, port, and group name were configured in the installation file.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the successful installation of the Linux agent.
2. Checked the firewall settings on the computer to ensure it was disabled.
3. Reviewed the configuration file for the server IP, port, and group name.
4. Investigated the `option.sh` script for any misconfigurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by three export lines in the `option.sh` script not being un-commented, which prevented the agent from properly communicating with the administration console.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by un-commenting the three export lines in the `option.sh` script. After making these changes, the Linux agent successfully connected to the administration console and was reflected in the system.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary lines in the `option.sh` script are un-commented during installation to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to double-check configuration files and scripts after installation to confirm that all settings are correctly applied.
