## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E8KBGIA3
- **Case Number:** 417457
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hub International Limited
- **Contact Name:** Ebenezer Brew
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
Some members of the IT team at Hub International Limited experienced difficulties installing and uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client. Issues arose after manual uninstalls, leading to computers appearing offline in the console. Attempts to reinstall the client resulted in port errors and MSI errors during uninstallation.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.0
- **Client Software:** Downloaded from the console

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation and uninstallation processes performed by the IT team.
2. Attempted to reinstall the client software downloaded from the console.
3. Reviewed error messages, including port errors and MSI errors.
4. Conducted a remote session with the customer to troubleshoot the installation.
5. Explored alternative installation methods using ManageEngine, which successfully installed the agent on endpoints.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the installation and uninstallation issues was related to improper handling of the client software during manual uninstalls, which left remnants that caused conflicts during reinstallation. Additionally, the server environment did not support the installation due to the absence of a fixed password, leading to invalid password errors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by utilizing an alternative tool, ManageEngine, to push the agents to the computers. This method bypassed the problems encountered with the standard installation process. However, it was noted that this solution does not work on servers due to the lack of a fixed password.

## Notes
- Ensure that all uninstalls are performed using the console to avoid conflicts during reinstallation.
- For server installations, verify that the correct password settings are in place, as the absence of a fixed password will lead to installation failures.
- Future installations should consider using alternative deployment tools if standard methods fail.
