## Problem Description
The customer reported that uninstall commands issued through the server were not functioning. Although the commands appeared to be sent, they did not execute successfully on the target machines.

## Environment Details
- The EPP Client was not communicating with the EPP Server.
- The customer was advised to check license availability and network connections.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the EPP Client was not communicating with the EPP Server.
2. Advised the customer to check for license availability and network connectivity.
3. Suggested testing the uninstallation of EPP clients using a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a lack of communication between the EPP Client and the EPP Server, which prevented the uninstall commands from being executed.

## Solution

## Notes
