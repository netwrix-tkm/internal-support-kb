## Problem Description
The customer requested the uninstall tool for the Endpoint Protector (EPP) agent to facilitate the removal of clients from their systems.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically concerning the client installation and uninstallation features.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Log in to the Endpoint Protector web interface.
2. Navigate to **System Configuration > System Licensing > Import Licenses**.
3. Upload the provided license file in .txt format.

The customer confirmed successful activation of the license, allowing them to uninstall the clients as needed.
