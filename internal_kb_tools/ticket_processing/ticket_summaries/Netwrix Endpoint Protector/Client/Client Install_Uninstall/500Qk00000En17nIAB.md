- **Case Number:** 418844
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Finastra
- **Contact Name:** JÃ³zsef Jozsef.Friedel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the unsuccessful removal of the Endpoint Protector client from non-licensed macOS endpoints using a script-based removal tool integrated with their Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.

## Environment Details
- The removal tool was deployed to approximately 230 macOS devices using Kandji.
- The log file indicated that the removal script executed without errors, but the Endpoint Protector client remained installed on the devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer utilized the provided script-based removal tool from Netwrix.
2. The script was executed on multiple devices, and the results were logged.
3. The log file was reviewed, showing that various components of the Endpoint Protector were not running or installed.
4. The customer confirmed that the script reported an exit code of 0, indicating successful execution despite the client not being removed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the script not effectively targeting or removing the Endpoint Protector client from the macOS devices, despite the log indicating successful execution. The absence of certain components (daemon, launchd starter, kernel extensions) in the logs suggested that the client may not have been properly installed or registered on the devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the removal script was correctly configured and executed. The customer was advised to:
- Verify the installation status of the Endpoint Protector client on the devices.
- Ensure that the script was compatible with the specific versions of macOS in use.
- Re-run the removal script after confirming that all necessary components were present and correctly configured.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the installation status of the Endpoint Protector client before attempting removal.
- Future deployments of the removal script should include checks for the presence of all required components to ensure successful execution.
- Customers should be informed about potential discrepancies in log outputs and actual software status on devices.
