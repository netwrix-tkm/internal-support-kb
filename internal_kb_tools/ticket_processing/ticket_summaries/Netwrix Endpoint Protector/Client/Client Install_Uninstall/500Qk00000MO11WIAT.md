- **Case Number:** 437296
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Elm Resources Inc
- **Contact Name:** Mark Petrina
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Mark Petrina from Elm Resources Inc, requested a script to uninstall the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) from multiple macOS endpoints using Mosyle, similar to a previously provided installation script.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Management Tool:** Mosyle
- **Existing Tool:** "remove-epp" UNIX executable found in the installation TAR package.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's requirement for an uninstall script specifically for macOS.
2. Informed the customer that the "remove-epp" script is included in the installation package and can be utilized with the MDM tool.
3. Followed up with the customer to ensure they received the information and to check if further assistance was needed.

## Root Cause
The customer was unaware that the uninstall script ("remove-epp") was included in the installation package and could be used directly with their MDM tool without needing to manually drop the file on each machine.

## Solution
The customer was provided with the information that the "remove-epp" script is part of the installation package for macOS. They were advised to download the installation package from the System configuration - Client Software section, where they could find the script to use in Mosyle for uninstallation.

## Notes
- The "remove-epp" script is intended for internal use only and should be deleted from each machine after use.
- Customers should be reminded to confirm that they will not share the tool with any third parties before providing internal tools.
