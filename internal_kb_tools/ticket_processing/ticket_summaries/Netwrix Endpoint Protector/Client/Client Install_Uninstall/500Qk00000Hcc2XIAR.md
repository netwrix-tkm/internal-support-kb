## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hcc2XIAR
- **Case Number:** 425415
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Edwin Coe LLP
- **Contact Name:** James Millar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues after upgrading to version 6.2.3.1 of Endpoint Protector (EPP). The client installed successfully but failed to connect to the server and did not discover any devices. The previous version of the client continued to function without issues.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Windows 11, version 24h2
- Deployment Method: SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the upgrade was initiated using SCCM.
2. Reviewed logs from affected devices.
3. Conducted a remote session to analyze the upgrade process.
4. Checked for upgrade logs on the endpoint machines.
5. Verified server address and certificate validity.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a problem with the certificate trust store configuration on the endpoint machines. The GlobalSign Certificate Authority was not trusted, leading to communication failures between the EPP client and server.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were recommended:
1. Ensure that the GlobalSign Certificate Authority is trusted within the environment.
2. Specifically, the following certificates need to be added to the trusted store:
   - R3 GlobalSign Root Certificate
   - GlobalSign Code Signing Root R45
3. These certificates can be downloaded from the GlobalSign support site.
4. After updating the trust store, the endpoint machines should be restarted to apply the changes.

## Notes
- It is crucial to verify that the correct certificates are trusted to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that the upgrade logs are checked post-upgrade to confirm successful installations.
- If issues persist after following the above steps, further escalation to the R&D team may be necessary for deeper investigation.
