## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MKHL0IAP
- **Case Number:** 437075
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** LGT Financial Services AG
- **Contact Name:** David Bloch
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP Client was unable to connect to the new server, consistently connecting to the old server instead. This issue arose while testing the EasyLock function.

## Environment Details
- **Client Type:** EPP Client
- **Old Server IP:** Retained by the old EPP client

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings of the new EPP client.
2. Attempted to manually change the server IP in the client settings.
3. Checked for any remnants of the old client that might be affecting the connection.
4. Investigated network settings to ensure proper routing to the new server.

## Root Cause
The old EPP client retained the IP address of the old server, which caused the new EPP client to default to the old server instead of connecting to the new one.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the old EPP client using the Zapp tool, which cleared the retained IP address and allowed the new client to connect to the new server successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that old clients are completely uninstalled before deploying new clients to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to verify network settings and client configurations after installation to prevent connection issues.
