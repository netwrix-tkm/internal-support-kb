- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nixon Peabody LLP
- **Contact Name:** Paul Goyette
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Install/Uninstall
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 (upgraded)

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to download the client software from the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server after following the installation instructions for the Offline Client patch. An error message appeared during the process, and despite seeing the EPP client packages, the download button did not initiate the download.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Previous Version:** Not specified, but the server was upgraded to version 5.9.4.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation instructions for the Offline Client patch.
2. Attempted to download the client package multiple times.
3. Checked for any error messages during the download process.
4. Upgraded the EPP server to version 5.9.4.0.
5. Installed the latest client version.
6. Tested deployment using SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager).

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by a compatibility problem between the previous version of the EPP server and the client software, which was resolved by upgrading the server to the latest version.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Upgrading the EPP server to version 5.9.4.0.
- Using an alternative application to upgrade the EPP clients, which allowed successful downloads of the client packages.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP server is always updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues with client software.
- When encountering download issues, consider checking server compatibility and upgrading as a first troubleshooting step.
- Future deployments should be tested in a controlled environment before rolling out to production to prevent similar issues.
