## Problem Description
A computer was not recognized in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server after an update to version 5.9.4. The device had previously functioned correctly, but issues arose following the installation of the client version 6.2.2.1006.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4
- **Client Version:** 6.2.2.1006

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the server update to version 5.9.4 was successful.
2. Checked the client installation on the affected computer to ensure it was correctly configured.
3. Reviewed device control settings to confirm the computer was included in the recognized devices list.
4. Restarted both the server and the affected client machine to refresh connections.
5. Attempted to manually re-add the computer to the device control list.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem between the updated server version (5.9.4) and the client version (6.2.2.1006). The client version did not properly communicate with the new server version, leading to the device not being recognized.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating the client software on the affected computer to a version compatible with the server (5.9.4). This ensured proper communication between the server and the client, allowing the computer to be recognized in the device control.

## Notes
- Ensure that client versions are compatible with the server version after any updates to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly check for updates and compatibility notes from Netwrix to maintain optimal performance and device recognition.
