- **Case Number:** 426881
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ANWR GROUP eG
- **Contact Name:** Edwin Hamzagic
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client Device Recognition
- **Feature:** Client
- **Version:** 6.3.2.1 (client version reported by the customer)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after migrating to the Hosted Server by CoSoSys, the Endpoint Protector had no effect on three out of four devices tested. Specifically, a USB stick was not blocked on these devices.

## Environment Details
- Devices tested: Four
- Client versions: 
  - 6.3.2.1 (on affected devices)
  - 6.2.2.1006 (on the device where Endpoint Protector worked correctly)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** The support engineer requested more details about the issue, including whether the devices should be blocked and the configuration of device rights.
2. **Version Check:** The customer confirmed the client versions being used on the affected devices.
3. **Installation Attempt:** The customer attempted to reinstall the client software but encountered an error message.
4. **Remote Session:** A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
5. **Re-registration:** During the session, the support engineer re-registered the clients in the backend of the server.
6. **Monitoring Request:** The customer was asked to monitor the clients for any changes after the re-registration.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure in the client registration process, which prevented the Endpoint Protector from functioning correctly on the affected devices.

## Solution
- The support engineer successfully re-registered the clients in the backend of the server.
- After the re-registration, the latest version of the client was installed on one of the affected machines, which resolved the issue, and the devices began blocking as expected.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation for a couple of days following the resolution to ensure that the issue was fully resolved.
- The customer confirmed that everything was functioning correctly after the changes were made, allowing for the closure of the case.
