- **Feature:** Client Device Recognition
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1010 (Client), P26E971E (Server), Windows 10 Enterprise 10.0.19045 Build 19045

## Problem Description
After deploying Endpoint Protector, multiple users reported issues with audio devices, including:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 Enterprise 10.0.19045 Build 19045

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected feedback from users experiencing audio issues.
2. Deployed a test build (version 6.2.4.0003) to a single machine to assess if it resolved the audio problems.
3. Monitored the performance of audio devices post-test build installation.
4. Discussed potential uninstallation of the agent on affected machines to determine if the issue was linked to Endpoint Protector.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the audio device issues was identified as a bug in the previous version of Endpoint Protector that affected the recognition and management of audio devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the 5941 patch, which included a fix specifically addressing the audio device recognition problems. Feedback from IT admins confirmed that the test build successfully resolved the audio issues on the endpoints.

## Notes
- Ensure that future deployments of Endpoint Protector include the latest patches to avoid similar issues.
- Monitor user feedback closely after updates to identify any recurring problems promptly.
- It is advisable to test new builds on a limited number of machines before a full rollout to mitigate potential disruptions.
