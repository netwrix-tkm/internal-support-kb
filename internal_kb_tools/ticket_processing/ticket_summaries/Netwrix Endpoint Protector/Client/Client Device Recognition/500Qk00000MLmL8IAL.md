## Problem Description
On several machines, when the client application was opened, no devices were displayed in the device control list.

## Environment Details
- Affected machines were running Windows 11.
- The machines were not connected to the internet.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue by checking the client application on affected machines.
2. Suggested the customer check for Windows updates and the installation of necessary Root Certificate Authorities (Global Sign related).
3. Conducted a remote session to generate logs and record the issue.
4. Provided scripts to change the server IP and check connectivity.
5. Instructed the customer to verify the server IP and connection status in the client UI.
6. Suggested checking the EPPNotifier's digital signature and certificate details.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to missing or untrusted root certificates required for the EPP client to function correctly. Specifically, the EPP notifier was not signed, leading to integrity fail issues.

## Solution
The customer followed these steps to resolve the issue:
1. Accessed the EPP folder in File Explorer.
2. Checked the properties of the EPPNotifier and viewed the digital signature details.
3. Compared the certificate name with the certificates listed in `certmgr.msc` under Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
4. Installed the missing root certificates as identified.

The customer confirmed that these steps resolved the issue, and devices were successfully displayed in the device control list.

## Notes
- Ensure that all machines have the necessary root certificates installed, especially in environments that are not connected to the internet.
- Regularly check for Windows updates, as they may include important security and functionality improvements related to certificate handling.
