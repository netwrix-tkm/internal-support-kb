## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NmJZQIA3
- **Case Number:** 441161
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alloy
- **Contact Name:** Joe Cacciapaglia
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Device Recognition
- **Version:** 11.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a Windows machine with the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client installed was not visible in the admin console, despite the client running and policies being updated. The customer was concerned about the limitations imposed by tamper protection, which hindered remote repair or reinstallation efforts.

## Environment Details
- Windows machines with EPP installed
- Management via Intune/MEM/Entra

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the `msiexec` command to uninstall the EPP client.
2. Suggested the customer update policies and sync with their Mobile Device Management (MDM).
3. Requested confirmation on the deployment success after the customer attempted to redeploy the EPP agent.
4. Inquired about the server IP address configuration in the EPP client settings.
5. Analyzed screenshots provided by the customer to identify configuration issues.

## Root Cause
The EPP agent was not deployed correctly due to a placeholder value for the server IP address ("EPP_server_IP") instead of the actual server IP address. This misconfiguration prevented the client from communicating with the admin console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer updated the deployment configuration to replace the placeholder IP address with the correct server IP address. Following this change, the EPP client was able to communicate with the server, and the devices became visible in the admin console.

## Notes
- Ensure that deployment scripts include clear instructions to replace placeholder values with actual server details to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Consider documenting the importance of verifying the server IP address in deployment configurations to prevent communication failures.
