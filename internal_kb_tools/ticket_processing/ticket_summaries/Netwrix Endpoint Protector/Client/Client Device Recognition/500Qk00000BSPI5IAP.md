- **Contact Name:** Geoff Gillard
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Device Recognition
- **Version:** 10.2.2.1006

## Problem Description
The client device (AUMELWK34) was not appearing in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector admin portal after reinstalling version 10.2.2.1006 of the EPP client on a Windows 11 device. Despite restarting the PC and updating policies, the device remained unregistered in the portal.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **EPP Client Version:** 10.2.2.1006

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the device name and version of the EPP client installed.
2. Restarted the PC to ensure all services were running correctly.
3. Updated policies in the EPP client to force a refresh.
4. Attempted to check the device registration status in the admin portal.
5. Coordinated with the customer for potential remote access to investigate further.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to certificate problems within the EPP client, which prevented proper registration of the device in the admin portal.

## Solution
Reinstalling the EPP client resolved the issue, allowing the device to register successfully in the admin portal. The customer confirmed that the device appeared correctly after the reinstallation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP client is properly configured and that all necessary certificates are valid before installation.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking for certificate-related problems as a potential root cause.
- Always confirm with the customer if they have the latest version of the client installed and if any updates were missed during the installation process.
