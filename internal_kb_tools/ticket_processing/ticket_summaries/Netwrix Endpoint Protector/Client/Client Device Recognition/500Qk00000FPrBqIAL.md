## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FPrBqIAL
- **Case Number:** 420277
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Lockheed Martin
- **Contact Name:** Nicholas Natale
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Device Recognition
- **Version:** 5.1.0.2

## Problem Description
Several CentOS 7 clients (10 out of 18) were reported as "Offline" in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector web interface. One client showed an "expired=1" line in the `options.ini` file, indicating a potential licensing issue, despite the licenses page showing no issues.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.1.0.2
- **Client OS:** CentOS 7
- **Client Version:** Initially running version 1.3.1.5, later upgraded to 1.7.0.7.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the operator to reinstall the client software on one of the affected machines.
2. Reviewed the `options.ini` file, noting the presence of `expired=1` and missing configuration parameters.
3. Checked the licenses page in the Endpoint Protector (EPP) for any license issues.
4. Attempted to collect logs from the affected clients using commands to create and monitor the `epp_client_daemon.log`.
5. Suggested upgrading the client to version 1.7.0.7 to see if it resolved the connectivity issue.
6. Conducted tests with a newer build of the client to check for logging functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely due to a misconfiguration or corruption in the client software, which was resolved by upgrading to a newer version (1.7.0.7). The presence of `expired=1` in the configuration file indicated that the client was unable to communicate properly with the server, leading to the offline status.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by upgrading the affected clients to version 1.7.0.7. After the upgrade, the clients no longer showed as "offline" in the EPP web interface. The customer was advised to proceed with this version on any hosts experiencing similar issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `options.ini` file is correctly configured before installation.
- Monitor for any intermittent issues with the EPP client GUI, as users reported that right-clicking the tray icon sometimes did not bring up the context menu. If this occurs, users can try killing the notifier process using `pkill epp-client` to reopen it.
- Future installations should consider using the latest compatible client version to avoid similar issues.
