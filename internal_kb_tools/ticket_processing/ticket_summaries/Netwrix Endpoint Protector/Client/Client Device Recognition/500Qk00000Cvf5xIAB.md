## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cvf5xIAB
- **Case Number:** 414726
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IP Steel
- **Contact Name:** Luc VANTROOST
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Client
- **Feature:** Client Device Recognition
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Endpoint Protector where two PCs were affected. The Endpoint Protector agent on the client PC indicated it could contact the server, but the server showed the PC as offline. Attempts to update agent policies on the client PC resulted in no action, and an error was logged in the system event log during the update process.

## Environment Details
- **Client PC Status:** Agent reports successful server connection as of "2024-07-10 15h55".
- **Server Status:** PC appears offline.
- **Error Log:** An error was logged every time the "Update policies now" button was clicked.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the connection status of the Endpoint Protector agent on the client PC.
2. Checked the server status to confirm the PC was offline.
3. Attempted to update agent policies on the client PC, which resulted in no changes.
4. Reviewed the system event log for errors related to the policy update.
5. Uninstalled and reinstalled the Endpoint Protector agent on the client PC, but the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was determined that the communication between the client PC and the server was disrupted, leading to the client being marked as offline.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session with the customer. Specific steps taken during the session were not detailed in the case, but the resolution involved restoring proper communication between the client PC and the Endpoint Protector server.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Endpoint Protector agent is properly configured and that there are no network issues preventing communication with the server.
- Regularly check the system event logs for errors when troubleshooting similar issues.
- Consider documenting the specific steps taken during the remote session for future reference in similar cases.
