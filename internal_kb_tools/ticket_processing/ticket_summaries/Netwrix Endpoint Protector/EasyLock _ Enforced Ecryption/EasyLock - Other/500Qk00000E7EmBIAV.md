- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the remote wiping capability of USB storage devices encrypted using EasyLock. Specifically, they found that when using the "Reset Device" button, files stored outside of EasyLock were not deleted, and data present before encryption remained accessible.

## Environment Details
- **Encryption Tool:** EasyLock
- **Device Type:** USB storage devices
- **Data Management Feature:** Remote wiping capability

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Conducted tests on USB devices with various data configurations (encrypted and unencrypted).
3. Reviewed documentation regarding EasyLock and remote wiping capabilities.
4. Engaged in discussions with the customer to clarify their testing scenarios and expectations.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the EasyLock encryption process, where only files encrypted within EasyLock were subject to deletion during the remote wipe. Files that existed prior to encryption were not removed, leading to the customer's concerns.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying the functionality of EasyLock to the customer, emphasizing that the remote wipe feature only affects files encrypted by EasyLock. It was recommended that users ensure all sensitive data is encrypted before relying on the remote wipe feature for data deletion.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that files not encrypted by EasyLock will remain on the device after a remote wipe.
- It is advisable to educate users on the importance of encrypting all sensitive data prior to using remote wiping features to avoid data retention issues.
- No feedback was received from the customer post-resolution, indicating a potential area for follow-up to ensure satisfaction.
