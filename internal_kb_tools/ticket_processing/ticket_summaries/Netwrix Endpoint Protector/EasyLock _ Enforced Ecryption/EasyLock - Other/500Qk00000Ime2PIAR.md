- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Day Pitney
- **Contact Name:** Jess Roman
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Problem Description
A user reported that they could not access USB devices on their computer, despite being in the correct security group and having appropriate permissions set in Active Directory (AD) and Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- The user is operating in a virtual environment using Xendesktop.
- The EPP Server was recently updated, and resource optimization was performed due to multiple 500 internal server errors.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified user permissions in Active Directory and Endpoint Protector.
2. Confirmed that the user was in the correct security group.
3. Checked the last AD sync completion date, which was found to be in October 2023.
4. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.
5. During the remote session, the AD sync was re-run to ensure all groups were updated.
6. Followed up with the customer to check if the issue was resolved after the sync.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an outdated AD sync, which had not been completed since October 2023. This led to the user not having the correct permissions reflected in the Endpoint Protector system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Running the AD sync again to update the user permissions in Endpoint Protector.
- Confirming that the user could now access the USB devices as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that AD syncs are performed regularly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If users continue to experience issues after an AD sync, further investigation may be required, including checking for software updates or potential conflicts in the virtual environment.
- It is advisable to keep the EPP Server and Client updated to the latest versions to leverage improvements and fixes.
