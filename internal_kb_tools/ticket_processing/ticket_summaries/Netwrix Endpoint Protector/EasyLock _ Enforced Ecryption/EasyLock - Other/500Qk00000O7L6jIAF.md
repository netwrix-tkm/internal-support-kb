- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ernst & Young Global Services LLP

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with copying files from one EY MAC machine to a USB drive and accessing those files from another EY MAC machine. They were specifically concerned about whether users would be prompted for a password when accessing the copied files on the second machine.

## Environment Details
- Two EY MAC machines with Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) installed.
- The USB device is managed by EPP with EasyLock encryption enabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested clarification on whether the query was related to NDC and asked for specific details about the files to be copied.
2. The customer confirmed that they were testing the behavior of file access between two machines with EPP installed.
3. The support team reviewed the EasyLock settings and the requirements for accessing encrypted files on different machines.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the configuration of the Endpoint Protector settings. Specifically, users are required to input the password for the USB device regardless of whether the EPP client is installed on the machine accessing the files.

## Solution
The support team clarified that users would indeed be prompted for the password when accessing files copied to the USB drive, even if the EPP agent is installed and functioning properly. This behavior is consistent with the security protocols established by the EasyLock feature of Endpoint Protector.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the password requirement for USB devices managed by EPP when transferring files between machines.
- Consider reviewing the EasyLock settings in the EPP configuration to adjust user access permissions if necessary.
- This case highlights the importance of understanding the security implications of using encrypted USB devices in a multi-machine environment.
