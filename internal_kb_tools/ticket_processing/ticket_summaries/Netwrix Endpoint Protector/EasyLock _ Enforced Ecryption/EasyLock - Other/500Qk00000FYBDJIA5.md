## Problem Description
The customer reported that EasyLock allows login without entering a password when deployed on a USB flash drive. This issue was observed with the EPP installation image "epp5810-64-mainline.iso" using Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.

## Environment Details
- **Image Used:** epp5810-64-mainline.iso (MD5: 8c9a951db7be341b9bfac27a50d384f3)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- **Affected Versions:** EPP5810 to EPP5940
- **Older Image:** EPP5208 with Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (no issues reported)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by attempting to log in to EasyLock without a password.
2. Checked the action history in EasyLock, which confirmed the 'Master Password Login Success' message when no password was entered.
3. Reviewed the deployment process and configuration settings for EasyLock.
4. Engaged the R&D team to investigate the issue and develop a fix.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a flaw in the EasyLock functionality within the EPP installation image "epp5810-64-mainline.iso" that allowed unauthorized access without a password.

## Solution
The R&D team created a new ISO installation image, EPP 5.9.4.0, which resolved the EasyLock issue. This image was specifically prepared for the Korean market and included the necessary fixes to prevent EasyLock from allowing login without a password.

## Notes
- The new ISO image should be distributed only to affected customers in the Korean market.
- Future images should ensure that the qemu guest agent is included, as it is required for customers using the Proxmox hypervisor.
- Customers operating in closed network environments may require additional support for applying fixes or updates.
