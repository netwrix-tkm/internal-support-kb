- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MBDA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EasyLock option appeared in the Windows context menu, despite only having the Device Control module. This caused confusion as the EasyLock option was non-functional and the customer requested its removal.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on a Windows operating system.
- The EasyLock option reappeared in the context menu after a computer restart.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Suggested the customer check the Windows Registry using `regedit.exe` to locate and remove the EasyLock context menu entries.
2. Provided specific registry paths to investigate:
   - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*shell`
   - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*shellex\ContextMenuHandlers`
   - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AllFileSystemObjects\ShellEx`
3. Offered to assist with a remote connection to help navigate the registry.
4. Conducted a remote session to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The EasyLock option was being added back to the context menu due to its integration within the system, likely as part of the software's default behavior. The customer was unable to find the relevant registry keys to remove the option permanently.

## Solution
- During the remote session, it was confirmed that the EasyLock option could not be permanently removed through the registry as it was being re-added by the system.
- A feature request (ID: 00440157) was created to address the issue of permanently removing the EasyLock option from future versions of the software.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that the EasyLock option will continue to reappear after restarts until the feature request is implemented.
- It is recommended to monitor future updates from Netwrix regarding the status of the feature request for a permanent solution.
