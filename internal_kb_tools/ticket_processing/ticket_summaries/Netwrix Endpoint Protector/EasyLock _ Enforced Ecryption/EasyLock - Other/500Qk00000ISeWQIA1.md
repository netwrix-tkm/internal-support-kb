## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ISeWQIA1
- **Case Number:** 427385
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alfa Elektronik Turkey
- **Contact Name:** Faruk SarÄ±
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EasyLock / Enforced Encryption
- **Feature:** EasyLock - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the EasyLock application where the master password was not being accepted despite being correct, resulting in an "incorrect password" error. Additionally, after updating the user password from the panel, access to encrypted devices was denied using both the old and new passwords.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in the EasyLock application, part of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector suite.
- The customer was using devices that had been encrypted with EasyLock.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the master password was indeed correct.
2. Attempted to update the master password from the panel, which was successful but did not resolve the access issue.
3. Conducted a remote session with the customer to troubleshoot the password access problem.
4. Escalated the case to the Engineering team for further investigation after initial troubleshooting steps failed.
5. Discussed potential workarounds and solutions with the Engineering team.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by agents communicating via Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) instead of IP addresses. This communication method led to problems with EasyLock passwords, particularly when passwords were changed.

## Solution
The resolution involved updating the agents to communicate using IP addresses instead of FQDNs. Once this change was implemented, the password issues were resolved, allowing access to the encrypted devices without further errors.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that agents communicate using IP addresses when dealing with EasyLock to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers experiencing password issues with EasyLock should be advised to check their communication settings as a potential troubleshooting step.
- Future updates to the EasyLock password section may be necessary to address any lingering issues related to FQDN communication.
