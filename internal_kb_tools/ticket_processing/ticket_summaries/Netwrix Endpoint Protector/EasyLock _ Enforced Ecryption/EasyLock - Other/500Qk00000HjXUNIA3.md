## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HjXUNIA3
- **Case Number:** 425729
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Navy Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Sean Briza
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EasyLock / Enforced Encryption
- **Feature:** EasyLock - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The EasyLock Encryption application was not launching for users whose access was set to "Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1". Instead, users received a message indicating that the device was blocked, and no further action occurred.

## Environment Details
- The issue was reported in a Windows environment, specifically after an upgrade to Windows 11.
- The USB device in question was a single partition USB with EasyLock installed on the root.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Generated log files during a remote session to reproduce the issue.
2. Reviewed the WDAC (Windows Defender Application Control) policy settings.
3. Confirmed that the EasyLock application was correctly installed on the USB device.
4. Investigated the auto-launch functionality of EasyLock when connecting the USB device.
5. Discussed the expected behavior of EasyLock under different Trusted Device levels with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the WDAC policy settings that were blocking the EasyLock application from launching. The application was not being allowed to execute due to security restrictions imposed by the policy.

## Solution
The customer modified the WDAC policy to stop blocking the EasyLock application. After this change, the EasyLock application was able to launch successfully when the USB device was connected.

## Notes
- Ensure that WDAC policies are reviewed and configured correctly to allow necessary applications like EasyLock to function properly.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should check their WDAC settings and confirm that the EasyLock application is not being blocked.
- It is important to verify the USB device's partitioning and ensure it is a single partition for compatibility with EasyLock.
