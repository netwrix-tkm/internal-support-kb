## Problem Description
A user reported an issue with a Kingston USB stick that had the EasyLock application installed. Upon attempting to open EasyLock, the user received an error message stating, "The EndPoint Protector Client is missing. EasyLock will now close," preventing them from entering the password.

## Environment Details

3. Consulted with the Sales team to gather more information about the account.
4. Sent a note to Umesh Chauhan to gather additional details regarding the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was indicated that the EndPoint Protector Client was not installed on the user's system, which is necessary for EasyLock to function properly.

## Solution
The case was ultimately closed after a follow-up with the customer, who confirmed that they no longer required assistance. It is implied that the user may have resolved the issue independently or found the necessary installation for the EndPoint Protector Client.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EndPoint Protector Client is installed on any system where EasyLock is to be used to prevent similar issues in the future.
- When encountering prospects or unverified accounts, it may be beneficial to verify account details before proceeding with troubleshooting to streamline the support process.
