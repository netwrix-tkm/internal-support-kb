- **Case Number:** 442451
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** UCI Health
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Alvarez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EasyLock / Enforced Encryption
- **Feature:** EasyLock License
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
A user reported being unable to save a file to an encrypted USB flash drive using EasyLock, receiving a license expired message upon attempting to access the drive.

## Environment Details
- The organization recently experienced a shortage of Endpoint Protector licenses and was issued temporary licenses.
- Current license count: 11,801 with 11,524 in use.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. User inserted the flash drive, triggering EasyLock to prompt a recovery process due to an expired license.
2. Completed the recovery process and successfully retrieved the user's file.
3. User unplugged and reinserted the flash drive, reset to default settings, and created a new password.
4. User attempted to save a PowerPoint file to the drive; upon reinserting, EasyLock prompted recovery again and indicated an expired license.
5. User tested a second USB flash drive for encryption, which did not show a license expiration message.
6. Verified the second flash drive functioned correctly; the user accessed the PowerPoint file without issues.
7. Accessed the Endpoint Protector Management Console to confirm the userâ€™s EP client is currently licensed.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the expired license of the first USB flash drive used with EasyLock. The second USB flash drive did not encounter this issue, indicating that the problem was specific to the first drive's licensing status.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the second USB flash drive functioned correctly without any license expiration messages. The user was able to save files and access them without further issues. The licensing status of the Endpoint Protector was also verified to ensure the user had an active license.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify the expected behavior of encrypted devices when a license expires or is unavailable. Specifically:
  - Encrypted USB devices do not automatically reacquire a license once available; they may require re-encryption to function properly again.
- The customer opted not to upgrade to EPP version 5.9.4.2 at this time but may reach out for assistance in the future.
