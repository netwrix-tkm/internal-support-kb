## Problem Description
The customer reported a "License expired" error when attempting to use EasyLock on their Windows 11 workstation, despite having transitioned from a trial to a fully licensed version of the software.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Licensing Status: Fully licensed in the console

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set the USB device to "allow" under "Device Control" > "Devices" > Right-click on the device > "Manage Rights".
2. Navigated to the hidden folder ".EasyLock Settings" and deleted the file labeled "cs14c7el.data".
3. Deleted the executable file "EasyLock.exe" from the root of the USB storage device.
4. Downloaded the EasyLock utility executable from the provided link and extracted "EasyLock_util.exe" to the root of the USB storage device.
5. Downloaded the EasyLock package from the Endpoint Protector Server and copied it directly to the root of the USB storage device, overwriting existing files.
6. Attempted to open "EasyLock.exe" from the USB storage device and enter the password.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it is likely related to the configuration or state of the EasyLock application and its associated files on the USB storage device.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following the troubleshooting steps outlined above, particularly by ensuring that the EasyLock application was properly reinstalled and configured on the USB device. The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved and the case could be closed.

## Notes
- For future reference, if a similar "License expired" error occurs, ensure that the EasyLock application is correctly installed and that all necessary files are present and not corrupted.
- If the EasyLock master password needs to be reset, permission must be obtained from the customer to access the backend of their server for the reset process.
