- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Queensland Treasury
- **Contact Name:** Finn Ruth-Duffy
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Sales, Renewals and Licensing
- **Feature:** License Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about issues related to license management and automatic license renewal within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They were concerned about the adequacy of their licenses, as they were still operating under an Emergency License while awaiting clarification on their licensing situation.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- They had transitioned from an Emergency License to a new set of 1800 licenses but were unsure about their current license usage and management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer set the Automatic License Renewal to 15 days but observed no change in the number of used licenses.
2. They filtered the licenses by the "Last Seen Date" but found no entries in the larger date selections.
3. The customer filtered the computers by "Licensed/Offline" and sorted by the oldest date seen, discovering thousands of computers that had not been seen since 2020.
4. Attempted to delete three of the oldest computers to see if the license count would decrease, but the count increased to 2404 instead.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it appears that the license management interface may not have provided clear feedback on license allocation and unassignment, leading to confusion regarding the actual number of licenses in use.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the customer had their next 12 months of licenses in play and that they could reach out for further assistance if needed. The support team clarified that the increase in the license count after deletion was likely due to the system's handling of license allocation rather than an error.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor their license usage closely and to reach out for assistance if they encountered further issues with license management.
- It is important to note that bulk unassignment of licenses may not be supported directly through the interface, which could lead to confusion when managing large numbers of licenses.
