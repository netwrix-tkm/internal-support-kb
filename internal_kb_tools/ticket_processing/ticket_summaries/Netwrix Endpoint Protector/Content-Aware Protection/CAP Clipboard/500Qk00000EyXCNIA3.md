## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EyXCNIA3
- **Case Number:** 419205
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Aakash Patel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Clipboard
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, E-Solution, reported an issue during the POC stage where a configured policy intended to block and report the copying of source code via the clipboard was not functioning as expected. Users were still able to copy and paste source code despite the policy being in place.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP) for Clipboard

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the policy configuration settings for the clipboard protection.
2. Verified if the policy was correctly applied to the relevant user groups.
3. Conducted tests to replicate the issue by attempting to copy and paste source code.
4. Analyzed logs to check for any policy enforcement errors or conflicts.
5. Engaged in a remote session to further investigate the issue with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified during the remote session, where it was determined that the policy settings were not correctly enforced due to a misconfiguration in the policy application process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the policy settings to ensure proper enforcement. This included:
- Correctly applying the policy to the intended user groups.
- Ensuring that the policy was activated and functioning as designed.
- Conducting a final test to confirm that the clipboard protection was now effectively blocking the copying of source code.

## Notes
- It is important to double-check policy configurations and their application to user groups in future cases to prevent similar issues.
- Regular testing of policy enforcement can help identify misconfigurations early in the deployment process.
