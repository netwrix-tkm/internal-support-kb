- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the clipboard feature was not functioning correctly, specifically that the paste restriction was blocking all copy-paste activities, including internal activities, rather than just external ones.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Question:** CAP Clipboard

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration settings for Content-Aware Policies.
2. Verified the implementation of the clipboard restrictions.
3. Tested the clipboard functionality across different applications to confirm the scope of the issue.
4. Checked for any updates or patches that might affect clipboard functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration within the Content-Aware Policies, which inadvertently restricted all copy-paste activities instead of just external ones.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by adjusting the Content-Aware Policies to ensure that they functioned as intended, allowing internal copy-paste activities while still enforcing restrictions on external activities. All policies were confirmed to be working as expected after the adjustments.

## Notes
- Ensure that Content-Aware Policies are thoroughly reviewed and tested after configuration changes to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Document any changes made to policies for future reference and troubleshooting.
