## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JhYLHIA3
- **Case Number:** 430326
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DEVCON GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Falko Groebel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Clipboard
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating to Server Version 5.9.4.1, they were unable to paste SQL code from the clipboard into SQL Management Studio. However, copy and paste functionality worked in other applications like Notepad and Outlook.

## Environment Details
- The only activated CAP policy was set to "report only."
- The CAP log indicated that SQL code was detected in the clipboard.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that copy and paste functionality worked in other applications (Notepad, Outlook).
2. Checked the CAP policy settings and confirmed it was set to "report only."
3. Reviewed the CAP log to confirm SQL code was detected in the clipboard.
4. Engaged with the R&D team to investigate the issue further.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the activated "paste restrictions" in the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy, which prevented pasting SQL code into SQL Management Studio.

## Solution
The resolution involved identifying that the "paste restrictions" were enabled in the CAP policy. Once this was confirmed, the customer was informed that the behavior was expected due to these restrictions, and the case was closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that the CAP policy settings are reviewed when similar clipboard issues arise, particularly regarding paste restrictions.
- Future updates to the server should be monitored for any changes in clipboard functionality related to CAP policies.
