- **Case Number:** 438641
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KEURO Besitz GmbH & Co. EDV-Dienstleistungs KG
- **Contact Name:** Benjamin Gutberlet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Third Party Conflict
- **Version:** 20.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after installing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client, a specific software application called MobileX could not connect to its server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was isolated to one particular client machine, while other machines with the same EPP settings were functioning correctly.
- The problem was identified as being related to DPI (Data Protection Integration) settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue was with the MobileX client, not the EPP client itself.
2. Suggested disabling the DPI option for the affected computer from "Device Control > Computers > Manage settings."
3. Advised updating the EPP client policy and restarting the MobileX client software.
4. Tested various DPI settings, including enabling and disabling the "Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning" option.
5. Explored enabling bypass options for TLS handshakes and HTTP errors.
6. Suggested enabling the "Stealth DPI driver" as a potential solution.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between the EPP clientâ€™s DPI settings and the MobileX application, which prevented the application from establishing a connection to its server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling the "Stealth DPI driver" option on the affected client machine. This adjustment allowed the MobileX application to connect to the server successfully, while other DPI settings did not resolve the issue.

## Notes
- The "Stealth DPI driver" is designed to improve interoperability with independent software vendors and may be beneficial for future cases involving similar conflicts.
- It is recommended to monitor the situation and consider enabling the Stealth option as a global setting if similar issues arise with other users in the future.
