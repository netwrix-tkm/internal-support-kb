## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DVM1aIAH
- **Case Number:** 415995
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Albany International
- **Contact Name:** Justin Packard
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the CAP Exitpoint for OneDrive for Business was incorrectly classified as OneDrive Personal. This misclassification caused synchronization blocks when attempting to allow files to sync with OneDrive for Business while blocking OneDrive Personal.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in an environment where OneDrive was being used on a domain typically reserved for US government agencies, which may have contributed to the misclassification.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue with the customer regarding the misclassification of OneDrive.
2. Investigated the detection mechanism for differentiating between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal.
3. Identified that DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) must be enabled for proper classification.
4. Prepared a test build with a fix for the issue and shared it with the customer for testing.
5. Monitored feedback from the customer regarding the test build's effectiveness.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the detection mechanism for OneDrive for Business did not recognize the customer's domain as a "business" account, leading to the misclassification of OneDrive for Business as OneDrive Personal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing a fix included in version 5.9.4.1 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The customer confirmed that the problem was fixed after applying this version.

## Notes
- It is advised to enable DPI in environments where OneDrive is used to ensure accurate classification between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal.
- Customers should be informed that using domains typically reserved for government agencies may require additional verification to ensure proper functionality.
- Future deployments of test builds should be conducted only after internal QA confirmation to avoid potential issues.
