- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Content-Aware Protection (CAP) was not blocking Python and PHP code on the WhatsApp desktop application, despite being able to block these file types on other applications.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Testing Date:** Customer suggested a call for log collection on Friday at 10h BRT.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the blocking rules for Python and PHP files across various applications.
2. Tested the blocking functionality with other file types, which were successfully blocked.
3. Attempted to reproduce the issue in a controlled environment but could not replicate the problem.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified, as the problem could not be reproduced during troubleshooting efforts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the CAP was functioning correctly with other file types and applications. Since the problem could not be replicated, it was concluded that it may have been a transient issue or specific to the customer's environment at the time of reporting.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the functionality of CAP regularly and ensure that all applications are updated to the latest version to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If similar cases arise, consider collecting logs during the reported time of the issue to identify any anomalies.
