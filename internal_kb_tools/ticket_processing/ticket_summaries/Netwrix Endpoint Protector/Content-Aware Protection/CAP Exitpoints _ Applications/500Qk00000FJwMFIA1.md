- **Case Number:** 420009
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TAO Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Karan Sharma
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with Excel while working on Google Drive, specifically receiving frequent authorization prompts that were not related to any actual uploads or file movements.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred across multiple machines.
- The customer was using Google Drive in conjunction with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer added destination details to the Allow list but faced issues with changing addresses.
2. A test build of the agent was provided to the customer for installation and testing.
3. The customer was advised to use a wildcard in the allowlist to accommodate changing subdomains.
4. Follow-up communications were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the test build and the allowlist adjustments.

## Root Cause
The frequent authorization prompts were caused by the Content-Aware Protection settings in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which were blocking legitimate web uploads due to dynamic address changes associated with Azure blob storage.

## Solution
- The customer was instructed to add `*.blob.core.windows.net` to the allowlist to prevent the authorization prompts caused by changing subdomains.
- After implementing the wildcard and testing the new agent, the customer reported that the issue appeared to be resolved, with no further similar issues reported.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the situation for a few days after implementing changes to ensure that the solution is effective.
- Future cases involving dynamic URLs may require similar wildcard configurations to avoid disruptions in service.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need to test any new configurations thoroughly before finalizing changes.
