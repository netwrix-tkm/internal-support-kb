- **Case Number:** 415812
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arista Networks, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Bharani M
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Bharani M, reported that a newly created policy intended to block the applications Brave and Tor was not functioning as expected, allowing access to these applications despite the policy being applied.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Applications in Question:** Brave and Tor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the policy settings to ensure that Brave and Tor were correctly listed as blocked applications.
2. Verified that the policy was applied to the correct user groups and endpoints.
3. Checked for any conflicting policies that might override the blocking settings.
4. Confirmed that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector service was running properly on the endpoints.
5. Attempted to replicate the issue on a test machine to observe the behavior of the policy.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was confirmed that the policy settings were correctly configured, and the issue was likely due to a temporary glitch or miscommunication in policy enforcement.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the policy was correctly applied and functioning as intended. The customer was informed that the policy was now blocking the applications as expected, and no further action was required. The case was subsequently closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that policies are thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before deployment to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly review and update policies to ensure they are functioning as intended, especially after any updates to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- Maintain clear communication with customers regarding the status of their issues and any troubleshooting steps taken.
