## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K1mLdIAJ
- **Case Number:** 430865
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Communication Links
- **Contact Name:** Anil Bisht
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The client, Powerweave, reported that their emails were being blocked due to a PNG image format used in their email signature. This was a result of a policy that blocked all image formats at every exit point.

## Environment Details
- **Server ID:** F025XQ84
- **Policy Type:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The client attempted to add the PNG signature file to the "Allowed File" section under Allowlists.
2. The "Allowed File" rule was applied in the CAP policy.
3. Despite these attempts, emails containing the PNG signature continued to be blocked.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a CAP policy that blocked all image formats, including the PNG format used in the email signature. The attempts to whitelist the PNG file were ineffective due to the overarching policy settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reviewing and modifying the CAP policy to allow PNG image formats specifically. This adjustment enabled the emails with the PNG signature to pass through the exit points without being blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future policies that block file formats are reviewed for exceptions, especially for commonly used formats like PNG in email signatures.
- It is advisable to test policy changes in a controlled environment before applying them to production to prevent similar issues.
