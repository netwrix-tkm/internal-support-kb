## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JYPPTIA5
- **Case Number:** 429980
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Iris Worldwide
- **Contact Name:** James Grant
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** Teamviewer Host 15.60.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Teamviewer application was not being blocked by the content policy set in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Despite selecting Teamviewer within the Exitpoint of the content policy, sensitive content could still be transferred out via the Teamviewer application.

## Environment Details
- **Teamviewer Version:** Teamviewer Host 15.60.3.0
- **Policy Configuration:** Teamviewer listed as "Team viewer" in the admin policy GUI.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the content policy to ensure Teamviewer was selected as an Exitpoint.
2. Checked the naming convention in the admin policy GUI to confirm it matched the application being used.
3. Attempted to block the application using various naming patterns:
   - `teamviewer.exe`
   - `Teamviewer`
   - `*teamviewer*`
   - `teamviewer*`
4. Added the full path to the Teamviewer executable (`C:\Program Files\...`) in the policy settings.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was due to the application not being correctly identified and blocked by the content policy. The naming convention used in the policy did not match the executable name as recognized by the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the content policy to include multiple variations of the Teamviewer application name and its executable path. The following entries were added to the policy:
- `teamviewer.exe`
- `Teamviewer`
- `*teamviewer*`
- `teamviewer*`
- Full path to the executable: `C:\Program Files\...`

This ensured that all potential instances of the application were effectively blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that application names in the policy match exactly with the executable names to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Consider documenting any variations in naming conventions used by applications to streamline future policy configurations.
