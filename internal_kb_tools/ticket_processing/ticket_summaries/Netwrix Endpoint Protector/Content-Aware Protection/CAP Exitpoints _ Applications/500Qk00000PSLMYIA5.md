## Problem Description
The customer reported that the CiscoVPN (Cisco Secure Client) was disabling every 10-30 minutes when the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) client was installed.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the interaction between CiscoVPN and the EPP client.
- The customer confirmed that disabling Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning helped mitigate the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer disabled Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning, which temporarily resolved the issue.
2. The support team identified the need to add the CiscoVPN process to the exception list to prevent further disruptions.
3. Andrei Pop from the support team communicated with the customer regarding which process to add to the exceptions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a compatibility problem between the CiscoVPN (Cisco Secure Client) and the EPP client, which caused the VPN to disable intermittently.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to add the CiscoVPN process to the exception list of the EPP client. This action prevented the EPP client from interfering with the operation of the CiscoVPN.

## Notes
- It is important for future cases to ensure that any security software or endpoint protection solutions are properly configured to allow essential applications like VPN clients to function without interruption.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to check for compatibility settings and consider adding necessary processes to exception lists.
