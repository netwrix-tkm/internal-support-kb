- **Case Number:** 423291
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International

## Problem Description
Users reported that emails sent via Outlook were being blocked by the Endpoint Protector (EPP). The alerts indicated that the destination was Microsoft Teams, with details pointing to `outlook.office.com`. The issue seemed to arise after some users switched to Windows 11 machines.

## Environment Details
- Users were utilizing the desktop version of Outlook.
- The issue was noted to occur specifically after a recent update to Microsoft Outlook.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected and reviewed alert logs from affected users.
2. Confirmed that users did not have any Outlook add-ons installed.
3. Sent a test build of the EPP client to the customer for testing.
4. Engaged in communication with the customer to gather additional logs and feedback on the test build.

## Root Cause
The EPP Client was incorrectly blocking uploads on Outlook due to a conflict with the process names used by both Outlook and Microsoft Teams, specifically the helper process `msedgewebview2_exe`.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the EPP Client to version 5941, which included a fix for the process name conflict. The test build provided to the customer confirmed that the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that future updates to the EPP Client address potential conflicts with commonly used applications like Outlook and Teams.
- Monitor for similar issues after updates to Microsoft Office products, as they may introduce changes that affect EPP functionality.
