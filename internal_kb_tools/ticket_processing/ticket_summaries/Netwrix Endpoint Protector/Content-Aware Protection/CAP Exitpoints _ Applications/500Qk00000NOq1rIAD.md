- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Daycoval
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was unable to block the transfer of Brazilian PII (specifically CPF) information in the old version of Outlook. They noted that no policies were effective in blocking this data transfer.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically observed in the old version of Outlook.
- The regex patterns used for blocking were:
  - `b[0-9]{1,3}[0-9]{8}b`
  - `b[0-9]{1,3}[.][0-9]{3}[.][0-9]{3}[-][0-9]{2}b`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue further.
2. During the session, logs were requested from the customer to analyze the behavior of the policies.
3. The customer was asked to test if other policies (e.g., blocking PDF uploads) worked to determine if the issue was specific to Outlook.
4. The support team checked for updates and confirmed that the issue was addressed in version 5.9.4.1.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a compatibility problem with the old version of Outlook, which did not properly support the regex patterns used for blocking sensitive information.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to version 5.9.4.1, which included fixes for compatibility with the old Outlook and improved handling of regex patterns for blocking sensitive data.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that customers are using the latest version of the Endpoint Protector to avoid similar issues.
- Customers should be advised to test policies in different applications to confirm functionality.
- Future cases involving regex and Outlook should consider potential compatibility issues as noted in various Microsoft forums.
