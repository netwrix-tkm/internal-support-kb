- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where downloads of media files (specifically mp4 files) were blocked via the Chrome browser to a network-mounted drive. The same downloads worked as expected when using Firefox. The CAP report indicated that the file types were blocked as a content threat, despite no content-aware policies being configured to block such downloads.

## Environment Details
- The issue was isolated to one system within the Isha Foundation's network.
- The CAP (Content-Aware Protection) feature was in use.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the issue was specific to the Chrome browser.
2. Reviewed the CAP report which indicated that mp4 files were blocked.
3. Suggested checking if the affected computer was included in the policy named "Duplicate VPub."
4. Advised verifying whether the mp4 file type was set to be blocked or allowed in the denylist and allowlist.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the affected system being part of a policy that blocked mp4 file downloads. This was not initially apparent to the customer, as they believed no such policies were configured.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the affected system was indeed included in the "Duplicate VPub" policy, which had settings that blocked mp4 file downloads. Adjustments were made to the policy to allow mp4 file downloads to the network share via the Chrome browser.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly review and verify the policies applied to their systems, especially when experiencing unexpected behavior with file downloads.
- Future cases should include a thorough check of policy configurations related to file types and download permissions to prevent similar issues.
