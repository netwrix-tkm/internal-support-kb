## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was unable to detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during file transfers via the OneDrive Client, despite it functioning correctly in the past.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in an environment where the file location was previously added to an allowlist.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the functionality of Endpoint Protector with respect to PII detection.
2. Checked the configuration of the allowlist for the affected computer.
3. Removed the computer from the allowlist to test if detection would resume.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the inclusion of the computer in the allowlist, which prevented the Endpoint Protector from detecting PII during file transfers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the affected computer from the allowlist. After this change, the Endpoint Protector successfully detected PII during transfers via the OneDrive Client.

## Notes
- Ensure that any necessary file locations are not inadvertently added to the allowlist, as this can interfere with the detection capabilities of Endpoint Protector.
- Regularly review allowlist entries to maintain optimal functionality of the content-aware protection features.
