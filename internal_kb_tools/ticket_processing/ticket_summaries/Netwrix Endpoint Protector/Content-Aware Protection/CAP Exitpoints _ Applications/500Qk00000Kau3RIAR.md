## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kau3RIAR
- **Case Number:** 432022
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Sudipa Bera
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Exitpoints / Applications
- **Version:** 6.2.3.1 (client version that resolved the issue)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an in-house application required to upload reports using SSH through a script, but the uploads were being blocked by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy. Despite authorizing the action, it remained blocked.

## Environment Details
- The CAP policy was set to block and remediate.
- The customer was using an outdated version of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered details regarding the issue and confirmed that the uploads were blocked by the CAP policy.
2. Requested logs from the customer to analyze the issue further.
3. Provided instructions to verify if the endpoint was communicating with the EPP server.
4. Instructed the customer to update the EPP server and client to the latest version.
5. Followed up on the status of the agent upgrade and its impact on the SSH transfer.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the use of an outdated version of the EPP client, which was not compatible with the current CAP policy settings, leading to persistent blocking of the SSH uploads.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer successfully upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.3.1. Post-upgrade, the SSH uploads were no longer blocked, and the functionality was restored.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP client is kept up to date to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the functionality for a few days after upgrades to confirm stability.
- If issues persist after upgrades, further investigation into CAP policy settings may be necessary.
