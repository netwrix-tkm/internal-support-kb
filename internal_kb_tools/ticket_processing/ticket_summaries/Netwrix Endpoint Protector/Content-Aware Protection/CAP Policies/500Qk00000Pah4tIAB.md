## Problem Description
A customer with a trial console reported that the recipient details in their reports included unnecessary data, making the reports difficult to read. The customer requested a way to display only the email addresses without the additional details.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using a trial version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue pertains to the reporting feature that includes recipient details.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked for additional details and a screenshot to better understand the issue.
2. The customer provided a screenshot and server details.
3. The support team reached out to Tier 2 (T2) for further assistance.
4. The support team communicated to the customer that there is no option to shorten the recipient details in the reports.

## Root Cause
The unnecessary details in the reports are a result of how the Netwrix Endpoint Protector processes and displays email domains with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). There is no configuration option available to modify this behavior.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the current reporting format is standard and cannot be altered to shorten the recipient details. The customer acknowledged this explanation and confirmed that the ticket could be closed.

## Notes
- There is no option to customize the recipient detail display in reports due to the inherent design of the DPI feature.
- Future inquiries regarding report formatting should reference this case to clarify the limitations of the reporting capabilities in Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
