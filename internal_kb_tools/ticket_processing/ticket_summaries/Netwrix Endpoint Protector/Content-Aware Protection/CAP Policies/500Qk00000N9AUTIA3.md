## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N9AUTIA3
- **Case Number:** 439516
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Financiera Codimersa
- **Contact Name:** Cristian Aquino
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a content-aware protection policy was created to monitor specific exit points with an action set to "report only." However, no logs were being received on the server for document uploads containing specific words from the denylist.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved document uploads (specifically Word and text files) not generating reports when certain terms were included in the denylist.
- The customer was using various browsers (Chrome, Edge) for testing.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to review the policy.
2. Joined the session and reproduced the issue by uploading documents.
3. Edited the content-aware policy and modified settings.
4. Conducted tests after modifying the policy:
   - Removed PDF from the policy and tested again.
   - Created a new Word document with example data (email address).
   - Modified the denylist to include specific terms.
5. Attempted uploads using different browsers; results remained undetected.
6. Edited the policy and custom dictionary, ensuring whole words were detected.
7. Updated client policies and tested again; still no reports generated.
8. Enabled Debug mode to log the issue reproduction.
9. Collected logs from the server and requested the customer to upload them to the case.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a configuration problem within the content-aware protection policy, specifically related to the file types selected for monitoring and the settings of the denylist.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Selecting the appropriate file types that the customer wanted the policy to report on.
- Updating the EPP client agent to ensure proper communication with the server.
- After these changes, the customer was able to view reports related to the uploads of Word and text files without further issues.

## Notes
- It is recommended to apply the content-aware protection policy to no more than 10 users to avoid overwhelming the EPP server with alerts, which could slow down its functionality in a production environment.
- If further assistance is needed for configuring SMTP in the EPP interface, a new support case should be opened.
