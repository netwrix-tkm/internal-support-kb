- **Case Number:** 433308
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Rubyplay Limited
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, RubyPlay, in the PoC process, requested assistance in detecting Google Docs labels (specifically the "Confidential" label) using the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy to block the transfer of confidential files. The challenge was that these labels are only visible within Google Docs and Google Drive and do not persist when files are downloaded or exported.

## Environment Details
- The labels created in Google Docs are not included in the documents when exported as file types (e.g., .docx).
- Endpoint Protector is designed to detect metadata embedded within files but cannot detect labels that do not exist in the local file system.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that Google Docs labels are only visible within the Google platform.
2. Verified that exported documents do not retain Google Docs labels.
3. Reviewed the capabilities of Endpoint Protector to detect metadata and embedded information.
4. Provided an example of a Word document showing detected metadata by Endpoint Protector.
5. Discussed the potential for the customer to switch to a corporate version of Google Docs that might allow labels to be embedded within files.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the nature of Google Docs labels, which are not included in the document files when exported. As a result, Endpoint Protector cannot detect these labels since they do not exist in the local file system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the limitations of Endpoint Protector regarding the detection of Google Docs labels. It was suggested that if RubyPlay transitions to the corporate version of Google Docs, it may allow for labels to be embedded within the files, which could then be detected by Endpoint Protector.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that Google Docs labels do not persist in exported files, which limits the ability of Endpoint Protector to enforce CAP policies based on those labels.
- Future inquiries regarding the detection of Google Docs labels should consider the customer's Google Docs version and whether it supports embedding labels in exported files.
