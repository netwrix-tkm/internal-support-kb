## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I0w6WIAR
- **Case Number:** 426409
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OneMain Holdings Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Imran Khan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when attempting to print a document containing a Canadian Social Insurance Number (SIN), the expected policy violation alert was not generated in the Endpoint Protector (EPP) console.

## Environment Details
- The issue was tested in a controlled environment where different SIN numbers were used to verify the functionality of the Content Aware Policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the policy settings in the EPP console to ensure the Canadian SIN detection was correctly configured.
2. Conducted tests with various SIN numbers, confirming that some triggered the policy while others did not.
3. Engaged with engineering to clarify the checksum validation process for Canadian SIN numbers.
4. Tested the printing functionality with valid SIN numbers to check if alerts were generated.
5. Reviewed logs from the EPP console to identify any discrepancies or missed alerts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a specific SIN number (375 814 356) that was incorrectly flagged as valid due to a mishap in the engineering process. The other tested SIN numbers matched the checksum and were processed correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the policy works as intended with valid SIN numbers. The customer was advised to use valid SIN numbers that match the checksum requirements for the policy to trigger alerts correctly. After successful testing with valid numbers, the customer was cleared to go live with the policy.

## Notes
- Ensure that any SIN numbers used for testing match the checksum validation rules implemented in the EPP.
- Future tests should focus on using valid SIN numbers to avoid confusion and ensure proper policy functionality.
- It is important to keep the EPP software updated to the latest version to benefit from ongoing improvements and fixes.
