- **Case Number:** 426466
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Naukri
- **Contact Name:** Vaneet Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was not capturing the destination URLs for incidents. Instead, the reports were only showing the application used (e.g., Chrome, Dropbox) without any specific URL details.

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered in an environment using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) enabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team requested screenshots from the customer to identify where the destination details were displayed.
2. The customer provided snapshots showing that the destination was not confirmed in the reports.
3. The support team instructed the customer to enable the "Destination Details" column by navigating to "Show/Hide Columns" and ensuring "Reporting V2" was enabled under "System Configuration" > "System Settings".
4. The customer confirmed that "Reporting V2" was already enabled.
5. The support team advised enabling "Deep Packet Inspection" under "Device Control" > "Global Settings" to allow URLs or domains to be reported.
6. The customer enabled DPI but reported that users began receiving block pages on internal URLs.
7. The support team investigated the interaction between the Endpoint Protector and other installed agents (CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect).

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the configuration of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in conjunction with other security agents (CrowdStrike and PaloAlto), which led to conflicts and blocking of legitimate traffic, including internal URLs.

## Solution
- The support team provided a workaround by suggesting the customer disable DPI temporarily to resolve the blocking issue.
- They also recommended reviewing and potentially modifying the DPI denylists to prevent blocking of internal domains.
- The support team confirmed that the issue with capturing destination URLs was resolved once DPI was configured correctly and the necessary settings were enabled.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that DPI settings do not conflict with other security applications to avoid unintended blocking of traffic.
- Customers should be advised to regularly review their DPI configurations and denylists to maintain proper functionality without compromising security.
