- **Account/Company:** Black Sesame Technologies

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a specific user was logged for multiple "Content Thread Detected" events related to their SSH configuration files. The destination details were empty, and the destination type was identified as WinSCP/SCP/SFTP/SSH. The customer was concerned about why only this particular user was experiencing these alerts while others using similar tools were not.

## Environment Details
- The user experiencing the issue was running the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client version Windows 6.2.4.2000.
- The alerts were generated by PowerShell.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to gather more information.
2. Reviewed logs showing the user was using SSL files.
3. Discussed the Denylist and Allowlist configurations with the customer.
4. Recommended whitelisting the SSH configuration files or the directory containing them to reduce alerts.
5. Suggested that the customer collect the files and test moving them to the Allowlist before proceeding with whitelisting locations.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was speculated that the specific user might have been using WinSCP in a manner that triggered the alerts, while other users did not experience the same behavior.

## Solution
The issue was addressed by advising the customer to move the SSH configuration files to the Allowlist to see if the alerts reoccurred. The customer agreed to test this solution and subsequently authorized the closure of the case after confirming that the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the Allowlist and Denylist configurations to ensure that legitimate files are not incorrectly flagged as threats.
- Future cases involving similar alerts should consider the specific usage patterns of the affected users and the configurations of their tools.
