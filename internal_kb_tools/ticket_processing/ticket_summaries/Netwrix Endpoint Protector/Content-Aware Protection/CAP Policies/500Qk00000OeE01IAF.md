## Problem Description
The customer reported that logs were capturing events where both the source and destination were identified as Microsoft Teams. They requested clarification on the scenario that led to these events being logged.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically under the Content-Aware Protection component and CAP Policies feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the attached screenshot provided by the customer to analyze the logged events.
2. Investigated the logging mechanism of Netwrix Endpoint Protector to understand how it captures source and destination data.
3. Consulted internal documentation regarding Microsoft Teams interactions within the Netwrix environment.
4. Engaged in discussions with technical team members to gather insights on similar cases.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was determined that the logging of both source and destination as Microsoft Teams could be attributed to the nature of the interactions occurring within the Microsoft Teams platform itself, which may involve internal communications or file transfers.

## Solution
The customer's question was addressed by providing an explanation of the logging behavior observed in Microsoft Teams. It was clarified that the logs reflect legitimate interactions within the application, and no further action was required on their part.

## Notes
- It is important for future reference to monitor similar cases where both source and destination are the same application, as this may indicate normal operational behavior rather than an issue.
- Customers should be encouraged to provide screenshots or detailed logs when reporting similar queries to facilitate quicker resolution.
