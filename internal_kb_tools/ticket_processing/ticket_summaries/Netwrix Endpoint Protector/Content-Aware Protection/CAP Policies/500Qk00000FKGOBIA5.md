- **Case Number:** 420030
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Southern California (USC)
- **Contact Name:** Tin Duong
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported false positives being flagged by a policy that checks for Social Security Numbers (SSNs) on files located on a remote network file share. After manual inspection, it was determined that these flagged files were indeed false positives. The user attempted to authorize the flagged files but was denied access.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in an environment utilizing Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reviewed the policy settings and the files being flagged.
2. Manual inspection of the flagged files was conducted to confirm they were false positives.
3. Recommendations were provided to whitelist specific file locations to prevent unnecessary scanning.
4. The following file paths were suggested for whitelisting:
   - `/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/`
   - `/Volumes/Backups of /*`
   - `/Volumes/Backup /*.previous/*`
   - `/Volumes/Backup /*.inprogress/*`
5. The user was advised to set the specific device used for Time Machine backups to "allow access and exclude from CAP scanning."

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the scanning of over 300,000 files, which led to performance problems and failures in the Time Machine backup process. This excessive scanning triggered false positives for SSN violations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing the following actions:
- Whitelisting the specified Time Machine file locations in the CAP policy to prevent them from being scanned.
- Adjusting the access rights for the Time Machine backup device to exclude it from CAP scanning.

These changes allowed the Time Machine backups to proceed without errors and eliminated the false positive alerts.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the number of files being scanned to avoid performance issues in the future.
- Whitelisting should be carefully managed to ensure that legitimate security checks are not bypassed inadvertently.
- Future configurations should consider the volume of files and the potential impact on backup processes to prevent similar issues.
