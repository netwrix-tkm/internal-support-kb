## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I9DyBIAV
- **Case Number:** 426630
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Andaria Financial Services
- **Contact Name:** Nirav Patel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their configured Content Aware Policies were not functioning as intended. Specifically, OneDrive was still being detected in the logs despite being excluded from the policy, leading to numerous false positives. The customer sought a way to minimize false positives without excluding any data sources.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue involved the Content Aware Protection (CAP) policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the Content Aware Policies to ensure OneDrive was correctly excluded.
2. Analyzed event logs to confirm the presence of multiple entries for the same files at identical timestamps.
3. Discussed the design of the Endpoint Protector's logging mechanism with the R&D team to understand the reporting of multiple log entries.
4. Suggested the use of "Contextual Detection" and "Regular Expression" features to help reduce false positives.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the design of the Endpoint Protector's logging mechanism, which is intended to report multiple event logs for confidential data found in files. This design allows for detailed reporting of threats found in different components of archive files (e.g., ZIP or XLSX files), resulting in multiple log entries for the same incident.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the behavior of the Endpoint Protector was by design. The support team recommended that the customer utilize the "Contextual Detection" and "Regular Expression" features to help minimize false positives. Additionally, it was advised to keep both the Endpoint Protector Server and Clients updated with the latest versions to benefit from ongoing improvements.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that the current design of the Endpoint Protector will continue to generate multiple log entries for incidents involving archive files.
- Regular updates to the software are crucial for minimizing false positives and improving overall functionality.
- Future inquiries regarding similar issues should focus on the design of the logging mechanism and the available features to mitigate false positives.
