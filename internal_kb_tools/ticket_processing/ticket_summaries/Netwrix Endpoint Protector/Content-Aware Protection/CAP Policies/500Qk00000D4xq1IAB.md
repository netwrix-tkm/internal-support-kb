## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported an issue where many CAP events displayed the message "No matching records found" when attempting to view details in the CAP reports.

## Environment Details
- The issue was reproduced on a 5920 server and the equivalent client on Ubuntu 22.04, as well as on a 5940 server with the matching client for Windows 10 x64.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reviewed the video and screenshots provided by the customer.
2. The issue was escalated to the development team for further investigation.
3. A CAP log was created to analyze the details of the events.
4. The team attempted to reproduce the issue using different server and client configurations.
5. It was identified that the issue occurred specifically when the policy name contained the "&" character.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the presence of the "&" character in the policy name. When filtering CAP reports using a policy name that included this character, the system returned "No matching records found."

## Solution
The issue was resolved by scheduling a hotfix delivery in the upcoming 5950 server update. In the meantime, users were advised to avoid using the "&" character in policy names as a workaround.

## Notes
- Users should refrain from using the "&" character in policy names until the hotfix is applied.
- The issue has been logged for future reference, and a new issue related to this problem has been created for tracking purposes.
