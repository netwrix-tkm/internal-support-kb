## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the functionality of the "Generate" button in the Contextual Detection feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They wanted to know if clicking "Generate" would compile all existing contextual lists into one XML file or just the most recent one. Additionally, they asked whether they needed to create separate contextual lists for each type of credit card or if selecting one type would suffice for all.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with a focus on Contextual Detection and Content-Aware Protection policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's screenshots and descriptions regarding the Contextual Detection feature.
2. Provided guidance on how to manage credit card detection through policy settings rather than relying solely on Global Contextual Detection.
3. Clarified the functionality of the "Generate" button in relation to multiple contextual lists.
4. Explained the necessity of selecting individual credit card types for detection.

## Root Cause
The confusion stemmed from the customer's misunderstanding of how the "Generate" function works in conjunction with multiple contextual lists and the requirement for separate policies for different credit card types.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the following clarifications:
- When the "Generate" button is clicked, it compiles all active contextual rules into a single XML file, not just the most recent list.
- Each credit card type must be selected individually to ensure proper detection; selecting only one type (e.g., "Amex") would limit detection to that specific type and not cover others (e.g., "Discover" or "Visa").
- Recommended managing credit card detection through dedicated policies for better organization and troubleshooting.

## Notes
- It is important for users to save each new or updated contextual list properly before generating the XML file to ensure all rules are included.
- Users should be aware that selecting only one credit card type will restrict detection capabilities, and they should consider using a broader detection function if applicable.
