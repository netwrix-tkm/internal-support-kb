## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that the issue of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) blocking unidentified applications, previously addressed in ticket #23157 and resolved in EPP version 5.9.2.0, has reoccurred in version 5.9.4.0.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on Ubuntu Linux endpoints.
- The customer noted that almost all computers only had one such event in their reports.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to enable debug mode on the affected computers to collect EPP client logs.
2. Investigated the occurrence of the issue to determine if it appeared at specific times or after starting the computer.
3. Confirmed with the customer that the event was not common and difficult to reproduce.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified as the events were rare and did not consistently reproduce, making it challenging to gather relevant logs for analysis.

## Solution
The issue was marked as resolved when it was confirmed that the problem was not reproducible in the current environment. The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any further occurrences.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the issue may not consistently reproduce, especially on Ubuntu endpoints, which could complicate future troubleshooting efforts.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to enable debug logging and provide as much context as possible regarding the occurrence of the events.
