## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Bh2eXIAR
- **Case Number:** 411571
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Geislinger GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Panagiotis Dragatis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an incorrect Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy was being triggered for a user who was explicitly excluded from that policy. This led to confusion and frustration among users, as they were unable to perform actions that should have been allowed.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector with the "Use user rights" setting enabled in the System Settings.
- The issue was intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer collected logs using the EPP Support Tool, which showed the correct policies being applied after pressing the "Create Logs" button.
2. The support team suggested uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP client to re-register the client certificate.
3. The customer performed the reinstallation of the client on one machine and monitored for the issue.
4. The support team conducted a remote session to investigate further and applied backend procedures to address the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a potential synchronization issue with the client certificates, which caused the EPP client to incorrectly apply CAP policies. This was compounded by the intermittent nature of the problem, making it challenging to diagnose.

## Solution
- A hotfix (adv-2024-002) was applied to resolve the issue.
- The support team performed a re-registration of the client certificates from the backend during a remote session, which restored the expected functionality.
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation for a few days to ensure that the issue did not reoccur.

## Notes
- The customer reported that after the fix, they began receiving logs again, and the issue with the incorrect CAP policy was not experienced again.
- It is recommended to keep an eye on client synchronization and certificate registration processes in future cases to prevent similar issues.
