- **Case Number:** 426464
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoSoSys Korea
- **Contact Name:** daehee kim
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with blocking file sharing via AirDrop on macOS 15 Sequoia. Despite the content inspection report indicating that transfers were blocked, files (such as PNGs and PDFs) were still being successfully exchanged between devices (MacBook and iPhone).

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 15 Sequoia
- **Devices Involved:** MacBook and iPhone

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to block file sharing via AirDrop but files were still exchanged.
2. Customer provided logs showing that transfers from the iPhone to MacBook were logged as blocked, but no logs were generated for transfers from MacBook to iPhone.
3. A remote session was conducted to review settings and configurations.
4. The customer was asked to create a video demonstrating the issue.
5. The customer confirmed that the issue persisted even after reinstalling the EPP client and performing the initial setup.
6. The support team reviewed the logs and confirmed that the file transfer from PC to phone was blocked, but not the reverse.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a bug in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) software that prevented proper blocking of file transfers from MacBook to iPhone via AirDrop. The software was only blocking transfers initiated from the iPhone to the MacBook.

## Solution
The issue was registered in the development backlog for a fix in version 5.9.6.0 of the EPP software. The support team communicated that a test build could be provided once the internal ticket was resolved.

## Notes
- The customer was advised that the current behavior (files being transferred from MacBook to iPhone) is not considered a data leak by the EPP software.
- The customer was informed that the issue would be addressed in a future software update, and they were encouraged to monitor for updates regarding the fix.
- It is important for future cases to confirm the direction of file transfers and the specific settings in the CAP policy to ensure accurate troubleshooting.
