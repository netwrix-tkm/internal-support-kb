## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where files were being blocked due to permissions when attempting to copy files from their fileshare on a Mac. An alert indicated that the user did not have the correct permissions. However, when the Endpoint Protection (EPP) was turned off, the files could be copied successfully to the local drive.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Mac
- **Security Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection enabled

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the permissions on the fileshare to ensure they were set correctly.
2. Tested file copying with EPP turned off, confirming that the issue was related to the Endpoint Protector settings.
3. Reviewed the CAP policies configured in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to identify any restrictions that might be causing the permission issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies configured in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which were blocking access to the files based on the permissions set within the software.

## Solution
The issue was resolved as part of another ticket by the support team, which involved adjusting the CAP policies to allow the necessary permissions for file copying from the fileshare. The customer confirmed that the problem was resolved and requested to close the ticket.

## Notes
- Ensure that CAP policies are reviewed and adjusted as necessary when users report permission-related issues.
- It is advisable to test file access with EPP turned off to isolate whether the issue is related to the Endpoint Protector settings or the underlying file permissions.
