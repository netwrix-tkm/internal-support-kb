- **Case Number:** 432006
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BioCatch
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Itenberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about how the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector handles encrypted files.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Question:** CAP Policies

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's question regarding CAP's handling of encrypted files.
2. Confirmed that the system can monitor encrypted files as file types but cannot read their content due to encryption.
3. Communicated findings to the customer.

## Root Cause
The limitation of the CAP feature is inherent to its design; it can only monitor file types of encrypted files without accessing their content due to encryption protocols.

## Solution
Provided the customer with detailed information regarding the capabilities of CAP concerning encrypted files, clarifying that while monitoring is possible, content cannot be accessed.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that while encrypted files can be monitored, the content remains inaccessible due to encryption.
- Future inquiries regarding encrypted files should reference this limitation to set proper expectations.
