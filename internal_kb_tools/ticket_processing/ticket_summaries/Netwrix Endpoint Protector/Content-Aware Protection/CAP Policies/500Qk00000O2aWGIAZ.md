- **Case Number:** 441989
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating to the latest version of the server and client, the denylist was not applying correctly on a test device. While the denylist worked on other devices, the test device allowed access to some websites that should have been blocked, and the eppnotifier continued to spam notifications.

## Environment Details
- The test device was running macOS 13, while the other two devices that were functioning correctly were on macOS 12.
- All devices were configured under the same Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the test device was running a different operating system (macOS 13) compared to the working devices (macOS 12).
2. Asked the customer to check if the computer settings were the same for all devices.
3. Verified that the test device had Custom Settings while the working devices had Inherited Settings.
4. Provided instructions to restore the test device's settings to Global (Inherited) settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the test device being set to Custom Settings instead of inheriting the Global Settings from the CAP policy. This misconfiguration led to the denylist not being applied correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to:
1. Right-click on the test device in the Device Control section.
2. Select "Manage Settings."
3. Scroll to the bottom of the settings page and click on "Restore Global Settings."

This action restored the test device to the correct configuration, allowing the denylist to function as intended.

## Notes
- Ensure that all devices are consistently configured under the same settings (Inherited vs. Custom) to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to verify the operating system and DPI settings when troubleshooting issues related to policy application across different devices.
