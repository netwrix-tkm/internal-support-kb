## Problem Description
The customer reported that internal emails containing sensitive information were being incorrectly classified as external emails by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy, resulting in these emails being blocked.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically related to the CAP policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the CAP policy settings to identify misconfigurations.
2. Confirmed the email domain settings to ensure internal domains were correctly defined.
3. Allowed the Exchange Server for internal email communications.

## Root Cause
The CAP policy was not configured to recognize the internal email domain, leading to the misclassification of internal emails as external.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the CAP policy to include the internal email domain, allowing emails sent from the internal Exchange Server to be recognized as internal communications. This adjustment prevented the blocking of sensitive internal emails.

## Notes
- Ensure that all internal domains are properly configured in CAP policies to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update CAP policies as organizational email structures change.
