- **Case Number:** 442545
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector where a predefined content policy for blocking phone numbers stopped functioning after the customer modified the policy settings and removed a contextual list. The policy no longer blocked phone numbers or generated logs as expected.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after the customer added and subsequently removed contextual detection on a policy designed to block telephone numbers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to change the predefined content settings from "Phone Number" to "Report" and then to "Block & Report."
2. The customer created a new policy that successfully blocked phone numbers and generated reports.
3. The customer reported the issue to Netwrix support for further assistance.
4. A remote session was proposed to investigate the issue, including a request for logs from both the working and non-working policies.
5. The customer later self-resolved the issue by turning the problematic policy off and then back on, allowing time for the Endpoint Protector (EPP) to update the policy.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified, but it was determined that the policy required a reset (turning it off and on) to function correctly after the contextual detection settings were modified.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer turned off the problematic policy and then turned it back on, allowing the EPP time to update the policy settings. This action restored the functionality of the policy to block phone numbers and generate logs as intended.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be aware that changes to policy settings may require a reset of the policy for the changes to take effect.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should consider turning the policy off and on again as a first troubleshooting step before escalating to support.
