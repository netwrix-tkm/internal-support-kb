## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NGC1ZIAX
- **Case Number:** 439746
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Sai Nachiappan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Server 5.9.4.1 and macOS 3.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies created for their MacOS machines were not functioning as expected. While the policies for Windows machines worked correctly, the same policies applied to MacOS were either not working or only partially effective. Additionally, the customer was not receiving reports in the CAP reporting system.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **MacOS Version:** 3.4.1
- **Hosting:** Hosted by Netwrix

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer created two CAP policies: one for Windows and one for Mac.
2. Verified that the Windows policy was functioning correctly.
3. Attempted to apply the same policy to MacOS, but it did not work as intended.
4. Customer reached out for assistance and requested a remote session for further investigation.
5. During the remote session, the following steps were taken:
   - Verified if the Data Loss Prevention (DPI) module was enabled for the MacOS machine.
   - Enabled the Intercept VPN option.
   - Checked Full Disk Access and Accessibility settings from the Privacy & Security section on the MacOS machine.
   - Enabled the Intercept VPN extension.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the Intercept VPN option not being enabled on the MacOS machine, which affected the functionality of the CAP policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during the remote session by:
- Enabling the Intercept VPN option.
- Ensuring that the necessary permissions (Full Disk Access and Accessibility) were granted on the MacOS machine.
- Verifying that the DPI module was active.

The customer was also provided with a knowledge base article for client installation using JAMF and a script for further assistance.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Intercept VPN option is enabled for MacOS machines when applying CAP policies.
- Always verify that the necessary permissions are granted on MacOS for the policies to function correctly.
- For future installations using JAMF, refer to the provided knowledge base article for guidance.
