## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OLiI0IAL
- **Case Number:** 442850
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwitz Sdn Bhd
- **Contact Name:** Nurul Batrisyia
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Endpoint Protector's Content Aware Protection policy, configured to block sensitive data (such as credit card information and personal identification), was not functioning as expected when using Outlook Desktop. While file transfers via WhatsApp were successfully blocked, transfers through Outlook were allowed without any incidents being logged.

## Environment Details
- **Client OS:** Windows
- **Server OS:** Ubuntu Linux
- **Client Version:** 5.9.4.0 (initially reported), later updated to 5.9.4.2
- **Test Build Version:** Provided for testing with new Outlook

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed if the issue was occurring on all computers.
2. Collected information about the current server and client versions.
3. Conducted a remote session to install the latest server and client versions.
4. Provided a test build to check if file transfers were blocked in the new Outlook.
5. Explained the difference between DPI enabled/disabled settings.
6. Informed the customer to use dedicated applications for opening PDF documents to ensure blocking policies were effective.
7. Retested the functionality after the installation of the test build.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was due to the Endpoint Protector's inability to effectively block file transfers through the new Outlook version. The test build provided temporarily resolved the issue, but it was not fully deployed, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Solution
After multiple troubleshooting sessions, the following steps resolved the issue:
- The customer successfully installed the test build version of the client.
- The issues with blocking file transfers in the new Outlook and accessing sensitive PDF files via browsers were resolved once the add-in was installed.
- The customer confirmed that everything worked as expected after the installation.

## Notes
- The test build is intended for testing purposes only and should not be deployed across multiple computers until fully released.
- The customer was informed that the fix for the new Outlook upload blockage would be included in future releases.
- It is crucial to monitor the functionality after updates, as the customer experienced intermittent issues with the Outlook blocking feature.
