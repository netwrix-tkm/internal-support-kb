- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Meritto (No Paper Forms)
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had added five business domains hosted on Gmail to their Netwrix Endpoint Protector configuration, but users were still able to log in using personal Gmail accounts, which should have been blocked.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the configuration of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies.
- The customer mentioned that the Netwrix certificate was not updated on any of the browsers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer checked the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) settings to ensure they were configured correctly.
2. A test was performed by adding a business domain to verify if the blocking functionality was working as expected.
3. The support engineer attempted to log in with a personal Gmail account to confirm whether access was blocked.
4. Communication was exchanged to clarify the customer's mention of certificates and to confirm the operating systems in use.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an incorrect configuration of the DPI settings within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The DPI feature was not enabled, which prevented the system from effectively blocking non-allowed domains.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by enabling the DPI feature in the settings of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. This allowed the system to properly enforce the domain restrictions, blocking access to personal Gmail accounts as intended.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI feature is enabled whenever configuring domain restrictions to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to verify that the Netwrix certificate is updated on all browsers to ensure proper functionality and security.
- Regularly review and test the configuration settings after making changes to ensure they are functioning as expected.
