## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the logs displayed a different username than the one currently connected. This was causing confusion when trying to follow up on a previously opened case.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically related to Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was contacted to schedule a remote session to investigate the issue further.
2. A remote session was conducted to analyze how logs were generated and the usernames displayed.
3. During the session, it was confirmed that the username displayed in the logs was based on the username of the machine's EPP client rather than the actual user connected.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the EPP client on the machine displaying the username "administrator" when accessed via RDP by a user (in this case, Emin). The logs reflected the username of the EPP client rather than the actual user connected to the machine.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during the remote session by clarifying how the logs are generated. It was explained that if a user connects to a machine with the EPP client showing "administrator," that username will appear in the logs. When the user renamed a file from their own computer, their actual username was displayed correctly in the logs. 

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are aware of how usernames are displayed in logs, especially when multiple users may connect to the same machine.
- Future cases involving username discrepancies in logs should consider the EPP client settings and the context of user connections (e.g., RDP sessions).
