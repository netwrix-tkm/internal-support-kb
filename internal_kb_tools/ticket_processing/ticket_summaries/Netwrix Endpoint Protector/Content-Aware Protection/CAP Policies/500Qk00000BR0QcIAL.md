## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BR0QcIAL
- **Case Number:** 410960
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Canada Guaranty
- **Contact Name:** Jaimie Trotman
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Server: 5.9.3, Agent: 6.2.2.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in configuring a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy to block all print screens/screenshots on a specific website containing sensitive information, without affecting other screenshot activities.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Server Version:** 5.9.3
- **Agent Version:** 6.2.2.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to block screenshots but found it unreliable.
2. The support engineer confirmed that the current capabilities of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) do not allow for blocking screenshots on a per-website basis.
3. The support engineer offered to raise a feature request with the development team for future consideration.

## Root Cause
The limitation of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) software was identified as the root cause. The software currently does not support the functionality to block screenshots selectively for specific websites; it can only block screenshots globally.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the requested functionality is not currently supported by the EPP. The support engineer offered to submit a feature request to the development team for potential inclusion in future versions of the software.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that the current version of EPP does not support selective screenshot blocking.
- Consider raising feature requests for functionalities that are not currently available to enhance future product capabilities.
- Customers should be made aware of the limitations of OCR technology in this context, as it may not provide reliable results for blocking screenshots.
