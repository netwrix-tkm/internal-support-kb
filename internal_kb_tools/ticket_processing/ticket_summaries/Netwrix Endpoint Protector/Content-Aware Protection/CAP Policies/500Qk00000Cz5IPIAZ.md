## Problem Description
The customer requested recommendations on how to recognize TOR traffic and files using CAP and TOR files through eDiscovery policies.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically focusing on Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies and eDiscovery functionalities.

- eDiscovery does not support exit points, as it only scans elements from the local computer.
- A reference to the Endpoint Protector user manual was provided for additional guidance.

## Notes

- For future inquiries related to eDiscovery, always refer to the user manual for detailed functionalities and limitations.
