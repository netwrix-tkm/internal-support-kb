## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GjUK9IAN
- **Case Number:** 423135
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer initiated a Proof of Concept (POC) with a potential client and required assistance in setting up a policy to block source code across various locations. Although the policy was applied correctly and the extended source code feature was activated, the blocking functionality was ineffective, with minimal reporting on the blocked instances.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Linux
- **Policy Type:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP) Policies

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the application of the policy to ensure it was configured correctly.
2. Checked the activation status of the extended source code feature.
3. Attempted to identify any logs or reports generated by the system regarding blocked instances.
4. Engaged in communication with the customer to gather additional details about the specific locations where blocking was expected.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the support for Delphi Pascal, which is not covered by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Content-Aware Protection policies. The system only supports regular Pascal, leading to the inability to block source code effectively in the specified environments.

## Solution
The ticket was closed after confirming that the customer's request was addressed. The customer was informed that the product does not support Delphi Pascal, which clarified the limitations they were experiencing with the blocking policy.

## Notes
- Future users should be aware that Netwrix Endpoint Protector does not support Delphi Pascal for Content-Aware Protection policies.
- It is advisable to verify the supported programming languages and file types before implementing blocking policies to avoid similar issues.
