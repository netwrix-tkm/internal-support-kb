- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 7.0

## Problem Description
A user from the Prosecution Office of the Republic of Latvia was unexpectedly affected by a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) block policy, despite not being part of the targeted test group. The user had an outdated agent version and possibly lacked a valid agent license at the time of connection, leading to the application of the block policy.

## Environment Details
- The CAP policy was configured to block access for predefined and custom content.
- The policy was explicitly targeted at a test group consisting of two computers.
- The affected user was not part of this test group.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely with the customer (Elena) to gather information.
2. Reviewed logs to confirm the application of the block policy to the affected user.
3. Requested additional logs and details about the user's device and group membership.
4. Analyzed the configuration of the CAP policies to identify potential overlaps or conflicts.
5. Updated the agent on the affected user's computer and restarted the device.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by the affected user having an outdated agent version and possibly not having a valid agent license. This led to the application of a more restrictive CAP policy that was not intended for the user, potentially due to a regular expression (regexp) used across multiple CAP policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the agent on the affected user's computer and restarting the device. After these actions, the user was no longer affected by the block policy, and normal access was restored.

## Notes
- It is important for users to maintain updated agent versions and valid licenses to avoid unintended policy applications.
- In future incidents, it is crucial to gather logs during the occurrence of the issue to facilitate better analysis and resolution.
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any similar occurrences with logs for further investigation.
