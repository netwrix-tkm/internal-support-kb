## Problem Description
The customer reported two main issues:
1. Data transfer over Clouds: After uploading files to Google Drive, the logs incorrectly displayed the last file name instead of the updated one.
2. Bluetooth File Transfer Block: The customer requested support for Linux and Mac devices, as the current global settings only supported Windows.

## Environment Details
- The latest client was installed.
- IP, port, and department settings were configured correctly.
- The client was not visible on the server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the latest client was installed.
2. Checked IP, port, and department settings for correctness.
3. Gathered logs for analysis.
4. Attempted to send a 'GetServerInfo' request, which failed with the following error:
   ```
   cURL error is: 6, Could not resolve host: fjvixth.hosted.endpointprotector.com
   URL: https://fjvixth.hosted.endpointprotector.com/client.php/wsf
   proxy: yes [base/EppServerClient.cpp:1048 sendRequest]
   ```
5. Reviewed logs for additional insights.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a DNS resolution failure for the host `fjvixth.hosted.endpointprotector.com`, which prevented the client from communicating with the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the DNS settings were correctly configured on the customer's network, allowing the client to successfully resolve the host and communicate with the server. The customer confirmed that the ticket could be closed after verifying the resolution.

## Notes
- Ensure that DNS settings are properly configured in future cases involving client-server communication issues.
- The customer expressed a need for Bluetooth file transfer support on Linux and Mac devices; this feature should be considered for future updates to the product.
