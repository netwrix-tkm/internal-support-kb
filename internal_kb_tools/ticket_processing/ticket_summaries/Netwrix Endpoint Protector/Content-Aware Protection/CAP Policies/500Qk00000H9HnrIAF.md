- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H9HnrIAF
- **Case Number:** 424224
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Sudipa Bera
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that emails to internal domains were being blocked despite adding those domains to the allowlist. They were unsure if there was a limit to the number of domains that could be added, as they had over 100 internal domains but the allowlist seemed to only recognize 25.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **CAP Policy Configuration:** Allowlist set up for 100+ internal domains.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set up CAP policy with an allowlist for 100+ internal domains.
2. Attempted to send an email with an attachment to an internal domain.
3. Verified that the email was blocked due to the attachment.
4. Created multiple allowlists to see if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as the Epp client blocking internal emails being sent to the Exchange Server, despite the domains being added to the allowlist.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the Exchange Server was added to the email whitelist, which allowed the emails to be sent successfully without being blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Exchange Server is included in the email whitelist when configuring CAP policies to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Be aware of any potential limitations on the number of domains that can be added to the allowlist, and verify configurations if issues arise.
