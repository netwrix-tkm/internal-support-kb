- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HHlSDIA1
- **Case Number:** 424545
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, VIP-RENT, reported receiving numerous false positives in Content-Aware Protection (CAP) events related to Microsoft documents. Specifically, CAP policies were triggered for file transfers involving .xls files that allegedly contained sensitive information (e.g., phone numbers), which upon inspection were not present.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed with Microsoft Excel (.xls) documents.
- The CAP policies in question were related to the detection of sensitive data such as credit card information and personal identification numbers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer disabled Metadata Scanning to determine if it would reduce false positives.
2. Logs and documents were collected and attached for further analysis.
3. A test build was created to address potential issues with data extraction from .xls files.
4. Contextual detection methods were suggested to improve accuracy in identifying sensitive data.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the false positives was identified as:
- Issues with how data was extracted from .xls files, particularly concerning hidden rows that contained personally identifiable information (PII).
- Weak detection rules for certain data types (e.g., ua ID) due to insufficient public data for the checking algorithm.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Implementing a fix in the data extraction process, which was included in a test build provided to the customer.
- Encouraging the use of contextual detection methods to enhance the accuracy of sensitive data identification.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly review and update detection rules to ensure they are robust against evolving data types and formats.
- Future cases involving false positives should consider examining hidden data within documents and the effectiveness of current detection algorithms.
