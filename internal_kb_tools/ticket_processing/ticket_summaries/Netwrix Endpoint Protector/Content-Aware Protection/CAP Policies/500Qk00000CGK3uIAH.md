## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CGK3uIAH
- **Case Number:** 412905
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ServiceNow
- **Contact Name:** Arpitha Shetty
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 9.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a content-aware policy created to monitor all file types was capturing both uploaded and downloaded files, making it difficult to differentiate between the two.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) disabled.
- The issue was specifically related to monitoring file transfers from browsers and network shares.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer had not enabled DPI, which is necessary for differentiating between uploaded and downloaded files.
2. Suggested checking the "Source" column in the logs to identify the origin of the files.
3. Recommended enabling DPI and adding the DPI certificate to the MacOS Keychain app as Trusted.
4. Advised testing on a single machine with DPI enabled to verify the results.

## Root Cause
The inability to differentiate between uploaded and downloaded files was due to DPI being disabled. Without DPI, the system could not accurately monitor and report file transfer activities.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that enabling DPI is essential for differentiating between uploaded and downloaded files. The following steps were provided:
- Enable DPI from the server UI.
- Add the DPI certificate to the MacOS Keychain app and mark it as Trusted.
- For detailed instructions, a link to the DPI setup guide for MacOS was provided: [Enable DPI on MacOS](https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/how-to-set-deep-packet-inspection-on-macos-big-sur).

## Notes
- It is crucial to enable DPI to achieve the desired monitoring capabilities.
- The customer mentioned a conflict with Zscaler while performing a proof of concept (POC) for DPI; further investigation may be required in a separate support ticket if issues persist.
- Testing should be conducted on a few test machines before rolling out changes to the entire environment.
