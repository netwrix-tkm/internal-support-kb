- **Case Number:** 435197
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Aptitude Software
- **Contact Name:** Dave Young
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 (server), 6.2.4.2 (client)

## Problem Description
A user reported receiving frequent pop-up notifications indicating that content has been blocked while browsing a website, specifically claiming to block credit card numbers. The alerts occurred without any content upload attempts and were logged as web-upload events with no specific website associated, only showing Mozilla as the browser.

## Environment Details
- Server Version: 5.9.4.0
- Client Version: 6.2.4.2
- Disk space was nearly full prior to troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected with the customer to gather more information.
2. Verified the server version and found it was 5.9.4.0.
3. Checked disk space and confirmed it was nearly full; cleared disk space.
4. Suggested upgrading the server to version 5.9.4.1 to see if the issue persisted.
5. Identified that the issue occurred while using the SendGrid application for sending bulk emails.
6. Noted that the blocks were false positives since no uploads were occurring.
7. Created a contextual detection rule for the existing CAP policy to monitor credit cards.
8. Enabled extended logging to gather more data on the false positives.
9. Collected debug logs from the customerâ€™s laptop for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy incorrectly identifying normal web browsing activity as attempts to upload credit card information, leading to false positive alerts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating a contextual detection rule specifically for credit cards within the CAP policy. This adjustment allowed the system to differentiate between legitimate uploads and regular browsing activity, effectively eliminating the false positive alerts.

## Notes
- Ensure that the CAP policies are regularly reviewed and updated to minimize false positives.
- Monitor disk space on the server to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider enabling extended logging for better diagnostics when similar issues arise.
