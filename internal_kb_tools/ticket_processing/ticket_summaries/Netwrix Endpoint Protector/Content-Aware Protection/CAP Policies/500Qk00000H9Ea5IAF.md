## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H9Ea5IAF
- **Case Number:** 424222
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Abhishek Banerjee
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a policy for blocking MIP labels, set to "Block and Remediate," was functioning incorrectly. While the content was being blocked, there was no pop-up notification or remediation action occurring on the client side.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 5941
- **Manual Reference:** Page 96 of the Endpoint Protector 5 User Manual [Link to Manual](https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the blocking policy to ensure it was set to "Block and Remediate."
2. Checked client-side settings and logs for any errors or notifications related to the policy.
3. Escalated the issue to the engineering team for further investigation.
4. Provided the customer with a test build that was prepared to address the issue.
5. Conducted preliminary tests with the customer using the test build.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a bug in the existing build (5941) of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which prevented the pop-up notification and remediation actions from being triggered correctly when content was blocked.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by providing the customer with a custom test build (version 6.2.4.0013) that included the necessary fixes. The customer confirmed that the test build resolved their issue. Following this, the customer was advised to upgrade their appliance to the latest version to ensure the fix was included in future releases.

## Notes
- The test build should only be installed on a limited number of computers for testing purposes.
- Ensure that customers are informed about the importance of upgrading to the latest version to avoid similar issues in the future.
