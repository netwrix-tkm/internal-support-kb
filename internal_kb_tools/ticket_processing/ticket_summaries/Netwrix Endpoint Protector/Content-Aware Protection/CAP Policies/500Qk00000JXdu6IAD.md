- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sriwin Electric
- **Contact Name:** Sai Nachiappan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to generate the Content Aware report using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP Policies)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to pull the Content Aware report but was unsuccessful.
2. Support investigated the configuration settings related to the report generation.
3. It was identified that DPI Bypass was enabled, which could affect report generation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the DPI Bypass being enabled, which prevented the generation of the file shadow necessary for the Content Aware report.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to disable the DPI Bypass feature. Once this was done, the file was blocked, and the file shadow was successfully generated, allowing the Content Aware report to be pulled without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that DPI Bypass is disabled when attempting to generate Content Aware reports, as its presence can block necessary file shadow creation.
- Future cases involving report generation issues should first check the DPI Bypass setting as a potential cause.
