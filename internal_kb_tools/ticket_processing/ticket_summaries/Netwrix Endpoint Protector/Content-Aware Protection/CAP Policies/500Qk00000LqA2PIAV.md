## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where a daily report email sent via Yahoo Mail through the Outlook application was being blocked by a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) rule. The rule was designed to block encrypted files, and when active, it prevented the email from being sent without providing any notification of the block.

## Environment Details
- **Email Client:** Outlook
- **Email Service:** Yahoo Mail
- **CAP Policy:** Configured to block encrypted files

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the CAP rule settings and confirmed they were configured to block encrypted files.
2. Collected logs during the reproduction of the issue but found no relevant information.
3. Disabled the CAP rule, which allowed the email to be sent successfully.
4. Followed up with the client to confirm the issue and gather additional feedback.

## Root Cause
The CAP rule was incorrectly blocking the daily report email due to its configuration to block encrypted files. The absence of a notification when the email was blocked contributed to the confusion regarding the issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the CAP rule that was blocking the email. The client confirmed that once the rule was disabled, they were able to send the email without any issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that CAP rules are tested thoroughly before deployment to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a notification system for blocked emails to inform users when a CAP rule is triggered, enhancing transparency and user experience.
