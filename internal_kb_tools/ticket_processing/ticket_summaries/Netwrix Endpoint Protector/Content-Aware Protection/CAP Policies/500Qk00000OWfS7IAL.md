## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OWfS7IAL
- **Case Number:** 443337
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** CoreWin Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in configuring a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy to block file transfers to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections and the clipboard of virtual machines (e.g., VirtualBox). They reported that the "Thin Client" option in the CAP policy did not effectively block these transfers.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue pertains to file transfer blocking via RDP and virtual machine environments.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to use the "Thin Client" option in the CAP policy but found it ineffective.
2. Support advised the customer to ensure the "Remote Desktop Connection" exit point was selected in the CAP policy.
3. Support clarified that there are no dedicated exit points for virtualization platforms (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V) in the CAP policy settings.
4. The customer was informed that blocking file transfers to virtual machines is only possible if those platforms are explicitly listed as exit points.

## Root Cause
The "Thin Client" option in CAP policies does not reliably block file transfers via RDP clipboard or drive redirection. Additionally, there are no dedicated exit points for virtualization platforms in the CAP policy settings, which limits the ability to block file transfers to these environments.

## Solution
The customer was advised to:
- Select the "Remote Desktop Connection" exit point in the CAP policy to effectively block file transfers via RDP.
- For virtual machines, it was recommended to monitor future updates from Netwrix for potential support of additional virtualization exit points. If blocking file transfers to virtual machines is critical, the customer was encouraged to submit a feature request to Netwrix.

## Notes
- The "Thin Client" option is not a reliable method for blocking file transfers via RDP.
- Currently, blocking file transfers to virtual machines via clipboard or shared folders is not supported unless those platforms are recognized as exit points by Endpoint Protector.
- Customers should regularly check Netwrix Endpoint Protector release notes for updates on supported exit points for virtualization platforms.
