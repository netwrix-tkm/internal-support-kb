- **Case Number:** 428673
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IPRO SIA
- **Contact Name:** Elena Revzina
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where newly added users or computers to the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) Allowlist were not being recognized on client computers. This issue did not affect users who were historically part of the Allowlist. Despite multiple attempts to manually update policies on the client machines, the problem persisted.

## Environment Details
- The CAP feature was utilized to restrict access to a specific network share folder.
- The issue was isolated to newly added users/computers only.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to add new users/computers to the CAP Allowlist.
2. They manually executed the "update policies now" command on the client computers multiple times.
3. No changes were observed in the behavior of the client computers regarding the Allowlist.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the policy update mechanism for newly added users/computers in the CAP Allowlist. The existing users were unaffected, indicating that the problem was specific to the new entries.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the policy updates were correctly applied to the newly added users/computers. This involved verifying the configuration settings and ensuring that the CAP policies were properly propagated to the client machines. After the necessary adjustments were made, the new users were successfully recognized by the system.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all policy updates are correctly applied after making changes to the Allowlist.
- Future cases involving similar issues should consider checking the propagation of policies to new entries in the Allowlist.
- Regular monitoring of policy updates can help prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
