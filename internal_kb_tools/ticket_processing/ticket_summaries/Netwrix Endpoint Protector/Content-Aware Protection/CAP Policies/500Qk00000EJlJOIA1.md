## Problem Description
The customer, Nutri Lacteos San Antonio, reported issues when attempting to upload a file with a specific name to Zimbra webmail. Despite adding the file name to both the Denylist and Allowlist, the file was not being blocked as expected.

## Environment Details
- Web Browsers: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
- Context: Proof of Concept (POC) with the customer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the file name was correctly added to the Denylist and Allowlist.
2. Tested the upload of a file with a different name and confirmed it was blocked.
3. Conducted a remote session to further investigate the issue.
4. Reviewed the configuration of the Denylist to ensure it was set up correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration of the file name in the Denylist. The specific name was not set correctly, which allowed the file to bypass the intended restrictions.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by correcting the Denylist configuration. After ensuring the file name was accurately listed, the upload restrictions worked as expected. Additionally, the customer requested to monitor all files containing the word "formula," which led to the creation of a custom dictionary that was applied to the policy.

## Notes
- Ensure that Denylist and Allowlist entries are correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- When dealing with specific file names, double-check the syntax and formatting in the Denylist.
- Consider creating custom dictionaries for more complex filtering requirements, as demonstrated in this case.
