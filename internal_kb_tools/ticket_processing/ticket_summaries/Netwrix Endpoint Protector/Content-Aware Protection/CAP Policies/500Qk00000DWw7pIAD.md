## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DWw7pIAD
- **Case Number:** 416052
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dubai Customs
- **Contact Name:** Fawad Iaiq
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 95.9.3.0 with Hotfix #1.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where custom content was not being blocked in Word documents while using Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). Although the system successfully blocked Notepad with a custom keyword, Word documents were showing "DPI ByPassed Traffic" and "WebSocket Passthrough" events.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Version:** 95.9.3.0 with Hotfix #1.1
- **Location:** Dubai Customs

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings for the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies.
2. Checked the event logs for any relevant error messages or warnings.
3. Attempted to disable the "Bypass Websockets" option in DPI settings, which resulted in the content being allowed without any events being logged.
4. Reviewed the EPP documentation regarding filename blocking and denylist functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misunderstanding of how the filename denylist works within the EPP. The system was designed to block files based on specific extensions or complete filenames, but not by partial names alone. The customer expected that entering just the filename without the extension would suffice for blocking.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by making changes to the Allowlists file type configuration. The customer was advised to include both the filename and its extension in the denylist to ensure proper blocking. Additionally, it was suggested to add specific keywords in the Predefined Content tab to enhance blocking capabilities.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to customers that the filename denylist requires either the full filename with extension or just the extension for effective blocking.
- If customers express dissatisfaction with the current functionality, they should be encouraged to submit a feature request for future enhancements.
- Documentation should be reviewed and updated to ensure clarity on how filename blocking works to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future.
