## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E7Nz9IAF
- **Case Number:** 417388
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Airpak
- **Contact Name:** Stefania Oltean
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Airpak, reported an issue with a custom policy configured in the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) system. When a threshold of 3 was set for a dictionary list in the policy, the system did not block the file as expected. However, changing the threshold to 1 resulted in the file being blocked. The file contained multiple codes that should have triggered the policy.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Policy Type:** Custom CAP Policy
- **Threshold Settings:** Initially set to 3, then changed to 1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the custom CAP policy.
2. Verified the dictionary list and its contents.
3. Tested the policy with different threshold values (3 and 1).
4. Engaged in a call with the customer to discuss the issue and gather additional information.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the policy settings, specifically related to how the threshold was applied in the CAP policy. The threshold of 3 did not trigger the expected blocking behavior due to the way the policy was set up.

## Solution
The resolution involved selecting the appropriate threshold from the Policy Info section of the CAP settings. After adjusting the threshold to the correct value, the policy functioned as intended, blocking the file when the threshold was set to 3.

## Notes
- Ensure that the threshold settings are clearly understood and correctly configured in future CAP policies to avoid similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to provide additional training or documentation on how thresholds impact policy behavior for users configuring custom policies.
