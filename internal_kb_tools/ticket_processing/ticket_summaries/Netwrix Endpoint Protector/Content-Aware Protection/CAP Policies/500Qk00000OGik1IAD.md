## Problem Description
The customer was attempting to create a policy to block any connection to USB devices using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector but was unsure if the steps taken were correct, as the policy did not seem to work.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically the Content-Aware Protection feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Guided the customer through the process of creating a Content Aware Protection policy.
2. Steps taken by the customer included:
   - Navigating to Content Aware Protection Policies.
   - Creating a Custom Policy.
   - Setting the Policy Action to "Block & Report."
   - Specifying Policy Exit Points and Storage Devices.
   - Applying the policy to all storage devices.
   - Checking the policy entities and verifying if the policy reached the computer.
3. Customer reported that the policy did not work as expected.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misunderstanding of the correct settings to block USB devices. The customer initially did not realize that the Device Control menu had a global setting for blocking USB devices, which could be configured more granularly.

## Solution
The support engineer provided guidance on how to properly block USB devices:
- Instructed the customer to use the Device Control menu to block USB devices globally or for specific groups, computers, or users.
- Shared a link to the user manual for further reference on configuring rights: [Netwrix User Manual](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/DeviceControl/GlobalRights.htm).
- The customer confirmed understanding and successfully implemented the changes, leading to the resolution of the issue.

## Notes
- The customer initially faced a limitation in viewing devices, as only 200 devices were displayed in the Device Control/Devices section. This was later addressed by modifying the settings to display more devices.
- It is important for future cases to ensure that customers are aware of the global settings available in the Device Control menu for effective management of USB device policies.
