## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue during an investigation regarding data exfiltration, where they noticed that there was no recorded destination in the logged data. They could identify the method used by the end user to transmit the data but lacked information on the destination where the files were sent.

## Environment Details
- The customer did not have Reporting V2 enabled, which is necessary for capturing detailed logs, including destination information.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logged data to confirm the absence of destination records.
2. Inquired whether the lack of destination information was due to a setting not being enabled.
3. Identified that Reporting V2 was not enabled in the customer's configuration.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that Reporting V2 was not enabled in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector configuration, which is required to log detailed information about data transmissions, including destination addresses.

## Solution
Enabling Reporting V2 resolved the issue, allowing the system to log the destination addresses of transmitted data, thereby providing the necessary information for the customer's investigation into data exfiltration.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to enable Reporting V2 to capture comprehensive logging data, including destination information, for effective monitoring and investigation of data transmissions.
- Future inquiries regarding missing destination data should first check if Reporting V2 is enabled in the customer's configuration.
