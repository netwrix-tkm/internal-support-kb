## Problem Description
The customer reported that all websites were blocked except for Facebook and Instagram, which were included in the deny list.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a Mac OS device.
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) for web filtering.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the client's computer.
2. Re-installed the EPP and granted full access to the disk, accessibility, and Bluetooth.
3. Disabled and re-enabled the intercept VPN from the computer settings.
4. Updated the policy on the Mac, which enabled the network extension.
5. Checked the CAP policy and the deny list for the domains.
6. Corrected the deny list entries to `*facebook.com` and `instagram.com`.
7. Enabled intercept VPN traffic and ensured the network extension was active.
8. Tested blocking functionality for multiple domains, including Gmail, Yahoo, and WeTransfer.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was due to incorrect domain entries in the deny list and the network extension not being enabled on the client's machine.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correcting the deny list entries for Facebook and Instagram.
- Ensuring the network extension was enabled on the Mac.
- Allowing the EPP client full access to necessary system resources.
- Verifying that the intercept VPN was properly configured.

After these adjustments, the client was able to block Facebook, Instagram, and other specified domains successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that domain entries in the deny list are correctly formatted to include wildcards as necessary.
- Always verify that the network extension is enabled on the clientâ€™s machine when troubleshooting similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to check permissions and access settings for the EPP client during initial troubleshooting.
