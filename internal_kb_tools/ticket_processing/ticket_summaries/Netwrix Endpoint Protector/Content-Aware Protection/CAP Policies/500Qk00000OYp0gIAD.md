- **Case Number:** 443449
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hyundai Autoever
- **Contact Name:** daehee kim
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Server version 5.9.4.1, Client version 3.9.4.1006

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Windows app was not functioning properly in their environment. Specifically, no logs were generated related to the CAP policy, and file transfers using the app were not being blocked as expected.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Version:** 3.9.4.1006
- The issue was observed in the customer's environment after the Windows app was added to the CAP list.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the CAP policy to ensure it was set to block "Graphic Files" and "Office Files" from the Windows app.
2. Tested file transfers using both drag-and-drop and copy-paste methods.
3. Attempted to create a new CAP policy to see if the issue persisted.
4. Checked if the Windows app was correctly added to the backend.
5. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.
6. Identified a typo in the process name that was added to the policy.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by a typo in the process name that was added to the CAP policy. This typo prevented the Windows app from functioning correctly and generating logs.

## Solution
The typo in the process name was corrected, which resolved the issue. After the correction, the Windows app began functioning as intended, generating logs and blocking file transfers according to the CAP policy.

## Notes
- It is important to double-check the process names when adding applications to the CAP policy to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The behavior of not generating logs for repeated actions is expected; logs are only created for the first instance of a file transfer to prevent log flooding.
- Future tests should ensure that both the Windows app and any relevant policies are correctly configured before proceeding with file transfers.
