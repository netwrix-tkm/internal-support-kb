- **Case Number:** 443896
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli Sembiring
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Windows Endpoint Protector Client (version 6.2.4.2) that was preventing users from sharing files through Zoom meeting chat. The client was automatically blocking file uploads and displaying notifications when users attempted to open the file explorer within the Zoom chat, even before any file was selected.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Software:** Windows Endpoint Protector Client (6.2.4.2)
- **Application in Use:** Zoom

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Changed the view option in the file upload explorer from "details" to "list."
2. Disabled the preview pane in the file upload explorer.
3. Reviewed CAP Reports and policies to identify file types being blocked.
4. Attempted to reproduce the issue by connecting remotely to the client's device.
5. Checked for any Denylist configurations that might be affecting file uploads.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as expected behavior of the Endpoint Protector Client in conjunction with Zoom. The Data Protection Integration (DPI) feature does not function with Zoom, leading to the scanning of all files accessed by Zoom, even if the user does not attempt to upload them. This results in notifications for blocked files, which may occur randomly when browsing for files.

## Solution
The behavior was confirmed as expected, and it was explained to the client that the Endpoint Protector Client is designed to ensure comprehensive security by scanning files accessed through the Zoom file browser. No changes to the software or policies were necessary, as this is not a bug but rather a security feature of the Endpoint Protector Client.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that the Endpoint Protector Client will report blocked files when browsing directories in Zoom, even if no upload is attempted.
- It is recommended to review Denylist configurations to minimize unnecessary notifications.
- There are currently no plans to change this behavior in future updates of the Endpoint Protector Client.
