- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CVeNHIA1
- **Case Number:** 413559
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Value Labs
- **Contact Name:** Ganiraju Dasari
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0 Hotfix#1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were not receiving logs from the client to the EPP CAP (Content-Aware Protection) after upgrading their server to version 5.9.3.0 with Hotfix#1 applied.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after applying the hotfix on the server.
- The server environment is hosted on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue.
2. Collected client support logs for analysis.
3. Confirmed that the server was rebooted after applying the hotfix.
4. Verified the functionality of both the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 and the previous version v2.4.2.1006.
5. Requested additional information regarding the number of clients connected to the server during the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a malfunction in the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007, which was not sending CAP event logs correctly. The issue persisted even after the server was rebooted.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a PHP patch via the backend, which restored the functionality of the log transmission. The customer confirmed that the logs were being received correctly after the patch was applied.

## Notes
- It is important to perform a snapshot (backup) of the current state of the Endpoint Protector appliance before applying any backend procedures.
- Ensure that the endpoint machines are rebooted after applying hotfixes to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Future troubleshooting should include verifying the functionality of both the current and previous versions of the agents when issues arise post-update.
