## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CJb9sIAD
- **Case Number:** 413067
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrivatBank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported an issue where excluding a single computer from the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy also resulted in the exclusion of the entire department associated with that computer. The customer sought a way to exclude one specific PC from all policies while keeping the department included.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Policy Type:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Recommended the customer to use the option to exclude specific computers from the policy.
2. Confirmed that excluding a computer would automatically include all other computers in the department.
3. Addressed the customer's request for a method to exclude a single PC from all policies simultaneously.
4. Attempted to use the "Select all entries" feature to exclude the PC, which did not work as intended.

## Root Cause
The current design of the CAP policy management system does not allow for the exclusion of a single computer from all policies at once. Each policy operates independently, requiring manual adjustments for each policy.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying that the exclusion of a computer must be done manually for each policy. A feature request was opened to consider adding the ability to exclude a single PC from all policies simultaneously, but this request was ultimately refused.

## Notes
- Customers must manually exclude computers from each policy as there is no bulk exclusion feature available.
- Future feature requests for similar functionalities should be documented and communicated clearly to customers to manage expectations.
