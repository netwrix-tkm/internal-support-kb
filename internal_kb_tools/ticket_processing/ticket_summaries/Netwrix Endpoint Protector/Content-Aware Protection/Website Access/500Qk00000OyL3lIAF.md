- **Case Number:** 444630
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kepsure Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Support Support Team
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Website Access
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2000

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues accessing the AWS website. Although the site itself loaded without being blocked, the content on the page failed to load properly, resulting in error messages when interacting with certain services or sections.

## Environment Details
- Server Version: 5.9.4.1
- Browser: Brave
- Test Build Versions: 
  - 6.2.4.0125 (initial test build)
  - 6.2.4.2000 (fresh installation)
  - 6.2.5.0014 (subsequent test build)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered additional details and screenshots from the customer.
2. Sent the initial test build (6.2.4.0125) to the customer.
3. Attempted to connect with the initial test build, which failed.
4. Installed a fresh version (6.2.4.2000) of the software.
5. Tested the website with the Brave browser and stealthy DPI enabled, but the issue persisted.
6. Recorded a short video and collected logs for analysis.
7. Added `amazonaws.com` to the allowlist, which allowed the website to load successfully.
8. Informed the customer that text files could cause false positives during browsing.
9. Sent a new test build (6.2.5.0014) to address false positive issues and requested feedback.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the Endpoint Protector's content filtering settings, which were incorrectly flagging AWS content as a false positive. The outdated product version also contributed to the connectivity issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding `amazonaws.com` to the allowlist, which allowed the AWS website to load properly.
- Updating the Endpoint Protector to a newer version (6.2.5.0014) that addressed the false positive issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the allowlist is updated for any critical services to prevent similar access issues in the future.
- Be aware that text files can trigger false positives during web browsing, as they are continuously uploaded and downloaded.
- Always verify the compatibility of the browser being used, as certain settings (like stealthy DPI) may affect functionality.
