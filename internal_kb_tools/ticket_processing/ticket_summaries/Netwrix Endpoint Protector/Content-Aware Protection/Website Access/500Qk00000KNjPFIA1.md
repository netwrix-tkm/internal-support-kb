- **Case Number:** 431528
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Morton Community Bank
- **Contact Name:** Joel Cox
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Website Access
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
Members of a department at Morton Community Bank required login access to the Fedline website for regulatory work. The issue arose when the website was blocked, and while disabling Content-Aware Protection (CAP) allowed access, there were no logs indicating that the website had been blocked.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The stealthy DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) driver was enabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Disabling Content-Aware Protection (CAP) resolved the access issue but did not provide logs for the blocked website.
2. Created an allowlist for the blocked website.
3. Enabled the stealthy DPI driver.
4. Awaited customer testing after implementing changes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the website was being blocked by the Content-Aware Protection settings, but the logs did not reflect this due to the configuration of the DPI settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating an allowlist for the Fedline website and adding it to the policy. This allowed the website to be accessed without being blocked, and the stealthy DPI driver was enabled to ensure proper logging of website access.

## Notes
- Ensure that any critical websites requiring access are added to the allowlist to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the logs after enabling the stealthy DPI driver to confirm that blocked websites are logged appropriately.
- Regularly review and update the allowlist as necessary to accommodate changes in regulatory requirements or website access needs.
