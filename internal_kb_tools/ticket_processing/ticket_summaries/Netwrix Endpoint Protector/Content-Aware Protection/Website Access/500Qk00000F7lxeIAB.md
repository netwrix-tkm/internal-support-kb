## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000F7lxeIAB
- **Case Number:** 419602
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ABNR Counsellors at Law
- **Contact Name:** Robby Sirwaturai
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Website Access
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where users were unable to log in to a government website (https://web-efaktur.pajak.go.id) due to changes in the HTTPS certificate by EPP. This change resulted in login failures for clients attempting to access the site using certificate-based authentication.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature Involved:** Website Access

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the HTTPS certificate change on the government website.
2. Attempted to log in using different browsers and devices to rule out client-side issues.
3. Checked the configuration settings in Netwrix Endpoint Protector related to certificate validation and DPI (Deep Packet Inspection).
4. Reviewed logs for any error messages related to mTLS (mutual TLS) and DPI bypass.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the change in the HTTPS certificate by the government site, which was not recognized by the existing configuration in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, leading to mTLS errors during the login process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by allowing mTLS errors in the DPI bypass settings of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. This adjustment enabled the system to accept the new certificate and allowed users to log in successfully to the government website.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future changes to HTTPS certificates on critical websites are communicated to users to prevent login issues.
- Consider implementing monitoring for certificate changes to proactively address similar issues.
- Document any changes made to DPI settings for future reference and troubleshooting.
