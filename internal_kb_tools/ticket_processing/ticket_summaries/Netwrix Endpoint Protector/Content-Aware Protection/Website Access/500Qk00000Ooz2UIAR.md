## Problem Description
Colleagues in France reported an issue accessing two different banking sites. After logging in, the pages either did not load or remained blank. Adding the URLs to the DPI Whitelist did not resolve the issue, and removing the EPP client from the workstation allowed access.

## Environment Details
- **Location:** France
- **Security Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue further.
2. Followed up with the customer via email after no response to the remote session request.
3. Conducted a remote session where the Content Aware Protection policy was reviewed.
4. Identified that the required DPI allowed list was not included in the Content Aware Protection policy.
5. Modified the Content Aware Protection policy to include the affected domains.
6. Updated the policies on the user's computer.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the required DPI allowed list not being added to the Content Aware Protection policy, which prevented access to the banking sites.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding the affected domains to the Content Aware Protection policy.
- Updating the policies on the user's computer, which allowed access to the banking sites immediately after the changes were made.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI allowed list is properly configured in the Content Aware Protection policy for any critical sites to avoid similar access issues in the future.
- Always verify policy updates on user workstations after making changes to ensure they take effect.
