## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GTc0hIAD
- **Case Number:** 422533
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sheridan&Co
- **Contact Name:** Peter Longley
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Website Access
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The Content Aware Protection tab was missing on multiple client machines, preventing users from requesting a temporary password to upload to websites.

## Environment Details
- Multiple client machines affected.
- The issue was related to the Content Aware Protection feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the absence of the Content Aware Protection tab on affected machines.
2. Reviewed logs for any policy loading issues.
3. Escalated the ticket for further investigation.
4. Investigated whether the appropriate policies were assigned to the endpoints.
5. Analyzed log messages indicating the status of CAP (Content Aware Protection) and OTP (One-Time Password) codes.

## Root Cause
The Content Aware Protection tab was hidden because when a CAP OTP code was active, the epp-client did not load CAP policies. This was indicated by log messages stating "Skipping policy load because a CAP password is in effect," leading to an empty active policies list.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the appropriate policies were assigned to the endpoints and confirming that the CAP OTP code was not active when users needed to access the Content Aware Protection tab. Once the policies were correctly configured, the tab reappeared, allowing users to request temporary passwords.

## Notes
- Ensure that CAP policies are correctly assigned to endpoints to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the status of CAP OTP codes, as their activation can prevent the loading of necessary policies and features.
- Regularly check logs for messages related to policy loading and CAP status to proactively identify potential issues.
