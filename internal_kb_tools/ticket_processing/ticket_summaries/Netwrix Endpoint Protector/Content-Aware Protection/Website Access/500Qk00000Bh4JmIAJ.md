## Problem Description
An end user on a Linux system reported issues accessing specific URLs after applying security policies while connected to a VPN. Disabling the policies allowed access to the URLs, indicating that the policies were causing the blockage.

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Linux
- VPN Client: Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
- URLs affected:
  - `https://vpc-caap-dev-t5gvqgjksdsnydi6y25wfrqbny.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?`
  - `https://vpc-caap-stage-6xg4kdfp6wsiqg6yxpli7jdllq.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console`
  - `https://vpc-caap-qa-knbm52h7iizoqc62ii4yovreae.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/dev_tools#/console`
  - `https://vpc-caap-prod-un5utxo55ja3b3jc2mjlphq45e.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the URLs were not blocked by the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) in the 'Report and analysis' section.
2. Conducted a remote session to gather logs and reproduce the issue.
3. Suggested disabling IPv6 on the affected Linux system using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```
4. Instructed the user to update the policy on the client side and test the URLs in incognito mode on Chrome and Firefox.
5. Recommended whitelisting the affected URLs in the EPP dashboard under "Denylists and Allowlists" > "Allowlists" > "Deep Packet Inspection".

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be caused by the Cisco AnyConnect VPN software, which had specific packet routing rules that interfered with access to the URLs. The problematic rules were not configurable from the EPP side, and Cisco was unwilling to provide a workaround.

## Solution
The final resolution involved advising the customer to update the routing rules on their Cisco VPN configuration. The recommended changes to the rules were:
```plaintext
36  2985 ACCEPT     all  --  *      lo+     0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
36  2985 ACCEPT     all  --  lo+   *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```
to something like:
```plaintext
2        0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            127.0.0.0/8
3        2   146 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       127.0.0.0/8          0.0.0.0/0
```

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to VPN configurations are tested thoroughly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Document any specific configurations or settings that may affect URL accessibility when using VPNs in conjunction with endpoint protection solutions.
