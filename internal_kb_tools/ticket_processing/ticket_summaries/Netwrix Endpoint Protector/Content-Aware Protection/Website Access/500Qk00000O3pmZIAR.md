## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O3pmZIAR
- **Case Number:** 442045
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** YOKOHAMA INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED
- **Contact Name:** Vipin Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Website Access
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to restrict users from sending emails from their domain to Gmail, allowing only specific whitelisted emails. The requirement was to apply this restriction only to external emails, not internal ones.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically the Content-Aware Protection feature.
- The server was updated from version 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.1 during the troubleshooting process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Contact:** Gathered details from the customer regarding the impact and specifics of the issue.
2. **Remote Session:** Conducted a remote session to review email settings and policies.
3. **Policy Configuration:**
   - Reviewed and modified Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies to block emails to external domains, specifically Gmail.
   - Added allowed domains to the CAP policy.
   - Suggested creating a separate policy for HR users who need to send emails.
4. **Application Denylist Adjustments:**
   - Attempted to block WhatsApp and Brave browser in the Application Denylist.
   - Noted that WhatsApp was not being blocked as expected and planned to address this in a global support meeting.
5. **Client Upgrades:** Provided instructions on how to upgrade the clients and sent the manual via email.
6. **Bluetooth Transfer Issue:** Addressed a reported issue where files were not being blocked during Bluetooth transfers.
7. **Follow-Up:** Instructed the customer to update clients to the latest version and retest the blocking of WhatsApp.

## Root Cause
The initial policy configuration was not effectively blocking emails to Gmail due to misconfiguration in the Content-Aware Protection settings. Additionally, there were issues with the Application Denylist not functioning as intended for WhatsApp.

## Solution
- Successfully configured the CAP policies to block emails to Gmail and other external domains while allowing whitelisted emails.
- After upgrading the Endpoint Protector client, WhatsApp was successfully blocked.
- The customer was advised to open a separate ticket for ongoing client upgrade issues, as approximately 120 users had been upgraded, but others were failing to update.

## Notes
- Ensure that all policies are thoroughly tested after configuration changes to confirm they are functioning as expected.
- When dealing with client upgrades, consider testing with a smaller group of computers to isolate issues before a wider rollout.
- Document any anomalies in the Application Denylist functionality for further investigation in global support meetings.
