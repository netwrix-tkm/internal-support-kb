## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GuaxGIAR
- **Case Number:** 423648
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Avrioc Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Naveen Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The development team at Avrioc Technologies reported that applications such as jQuery, IntelliJ, and Android Studio were unable to connect to Java when Data Loss Prevention (DPI) was enabled. The connections were successful when DPI was disabled.

## Environment Details
- Applications affected: jQuery, IntelliJ, Android Studio
- DPI settings: Enabled/Disabled on userâ€™s computer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Engaged with the customer to gather detailed information about the issue.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the problem further.
3. Recommended removing URL categories to check if the issue persisted.
4. Suggested using virustotal.com as an entry point if URL categories were necessary.
5. Provided a test build to evaluate if it resolved the DPI-related issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to incorrect settings or policies regarding URL categories in the DPI configuration. The specific URL categories applied were causing the applications to be blocked when attempting to connect.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the problematic URL categories from the DPI settings.
- Testing the applications after the changes to confirm that they could connect successfully to Java.
- If URL categories were necessary, it was advised to use a more appropriate entry point that accurately reflected the actual destination URLs.

## Notes
- It is important to evaluate whether URL categories are truly necessary for the customer's use case. If monitoring specific destinations is the goal, consider testing without URL categories enabled to see if the applications function correctly.
- Future configurations should ensure that the URL categories are set to reflect the actual destinations used by applications to avoid similar connectivity issues.
