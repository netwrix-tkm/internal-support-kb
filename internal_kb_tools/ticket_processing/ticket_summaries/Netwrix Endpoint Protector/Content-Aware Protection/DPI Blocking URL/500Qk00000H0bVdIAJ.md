## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H0bVdIAJ
- **Case Number:** 423801
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Sudipa Bera
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
Many users, including high-level executives (COO and CFO), reported that certain URLs were inaccessible after the installation of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) agent. The issue was specifically noted when the EPP agent was active, as the URLs became accessible only when the agent was terminated.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** None specified
- **Build Number:** 5940
- **Age:** 7.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the EPP agent on affected users' machines.
2. Attempted to access the reported URLs while the EPP agent was running.
3. Terminated the EPP agent to confirm that the URLs became accessible.
4. Searched for logs or settings within the EPP agent that could indicate the cause of the URL blocking.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) feature of the EPP agent, which was blocking access to specific URLs without providing clear logs or settings to adjust the behavior.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the settings within the EPP agent to allow access to the blocked URLs. The specific configuration changes were not detailed in the case, but the resolution confirmed that the URLs were accessible once the appropriate adjustments were made.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the DPI settings in the EPP agent after installation, especially for high-level users who may require access to specific URLs.
- Future installations should include a review of URL access policies to prevent similar issues from arising.
- Ensure that users are aware of potential access issues and have a clear process for reporting them.
