## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JMNkcIAH
- **Case Number:** 429511
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Privat Bank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Privat Bank, reported that the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client was blocking access to the ChatGPT URL. Although adding `chatgpt.com` to the DPI Allowlist initially resolved the issue, the customer could not keep it fully allowed due to security measures.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) feature of the EPP client.
- The user faced difficulties passing the Cloudflare "humanity" check, which prevented ChatGPT from loading.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer added `chatgpt.com` to the DPI Allowlist, which temporarily resolved the issue.
2. Collected logs and screenshots demonstrating the issue.
3. Confirmed that disabling DPI allowed the user to pass the Cloudflare checks and access ChatGPT.
4. Investigated logs for any CAP (Content-Aware Protection) events related to the blocking of the URL.
5. R&D team was engaged to investigate the issue further and provided a test build for evaluation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the DPI feature interfering with the Cloudflare challenge, which is designed to verify human users. The DPI was blocking or inspecting the traffic in a way that prevented the challenge from being completed successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding `*.logr-ingest.com` to the allowlist, which helped the user pass the Cloudflare challenge. Initially, the solution did not work due to browser caching issues, but once cleared, the allowlisting functioned correctly.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that browser caches are cleared after making changes to allowlists, as cached data can lead to confusion regarding whether a solution is effective.
- The R&D team is working on a feature to improve HTTP/2 support for DPI, which may help prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to temporarily disable DPI if they encounter similar issues while accessing websites protected by Cloudflare.
