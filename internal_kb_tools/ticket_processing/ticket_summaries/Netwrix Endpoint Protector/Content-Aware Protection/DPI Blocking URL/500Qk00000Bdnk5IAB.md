- **Version:** MacOS Sonoma 14.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was blocking web access for mobile iOS virtual machines to any website after an update to MacOS Sonoma 14.5. This issue had previously occurred and was resolved in earlier versions of EPP.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** MacOS Sonoma 14.5
- **Affected Systems:** Mobile iOS virtual machines

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue by testing web access on affected virtual machines.
2. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to investigate further.
3. Collected logs during the remote session to analyze the behavior of the EPP agent.
4. Tested a new test build of the EPP agent provided by the support team.
5. Reinstalled the previous version of the EPP agent (3.0.2.2) to check if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem with the new EPP agent version when used with the updated MacOS Sonoma 14.5. The DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) feature was causing the blocking of web access.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reverting to the previous version of the EPP agent (3.0.2.2), which allowed the affected user to regain access to websites without any blocking issues. The test build provided did not resolve the issue, confirming the compatibility problem with the new version.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor future updates of the EPP agent for compatibility with MacOS updates.
- If similar issues arise, consider reverting to a stable previous version of the EPP agent as a temporary solution while investigating further.
- Ensure to collect detailed logs during troubleshooting to assist in identifying root causes more efficiently.
