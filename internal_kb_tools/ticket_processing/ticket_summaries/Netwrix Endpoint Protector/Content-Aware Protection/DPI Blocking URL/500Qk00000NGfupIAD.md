## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** DPI Blocking URL

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Flaviu Moldovan from technical support confirmed that the customer had attempted the usual steps for blocking URLs.
2. The customer was instructed to navigate to Denylists and Allowlists -> Denylists -> Domain and URL, and to add the URL and domain to the CAP Policy Denylist.
3. The customer reported that the steps provided did not resolve the issue.
4. A remote session was proposed to further investigate the problem.
5. During the remote session, the customer confirmed that the issue was no longer present and that URL blocking was functioning as expected.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the initial issue was not explicitly identified. However, it was determined that the problem was resolved during the remote session, indicating that the initial configuration or application of the URL blocking settings may have been incorrect or not fully applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by conducting a remote session where the technical support team was able to verify the configuration settings. The customer confirmed that the URL blocking was now functioning as intended after the session.

## Notes
- It is important for users to ensure that they follow the correct steps for URL blocking and to verify that changes are applied correctly.
- If issues persist, a remote session may be necessary to diagnose and resolve configuration problems effectively.
- Future users should be aware that sometimes issues may appear resolved after a session, but it is advisable to monitor the functionality closely for a period after changes are made.
