- **Case Number:** 437968
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Morton Community Bank
- **Contact Name:** Joel Cox
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that several web-based applications hosted internally (http://mcbappsXXX) were being blocked despite having a wildcard entry (http://mcbapps*) added to the DPI allowlist. This issue affected uploads and file transfers, which were necessary for their operations.

## Environment Details
- The applications were hosted on internal domains ranging from MCBAPPS101 to MCBAPPS204.
- The customer confirmed that the allowlist was set correctly and assigned to the appropriate policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the allowlist was correctly configured and assigned to the CAP policy.
2. Enabled logging to capture any relevant data regarding the blocking incidents.
3. Suggested removing and re-adding the allowlist entries to ensure they were saved correctly.
4. Recommended re-enabling DPI for the affected machine.
5. Collected logs for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the DPI not being properly enabled or recognized, which led to the allowlist not being applied effectively. This was confirmed by the absence of the DPI log file during initial troubleshooting.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Re-enabling the DPI feature.
2. Re-assigning the allowlist to the policy.
3. Testing the applications again, which confirmed that uploads and file transfers were no longer blocked.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that DPI is enabled and functioning correctly before making changes to allowlists.
- If similar issues arise, check the logs to confirm DPI status and ensure that allowlists are properly saved and applied.
- The customer reported intermittent functionality prior to resolution, so monitoring is recommended to ensure the issue does not recur.
