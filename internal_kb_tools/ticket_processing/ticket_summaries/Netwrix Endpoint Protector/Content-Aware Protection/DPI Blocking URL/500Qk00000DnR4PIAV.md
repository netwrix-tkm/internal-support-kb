## Problem Description
Users at Cyberspace reported that they were unable to access certain websites, which appeared to be blocked by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Content-Aware Protection feature of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific website mentioned was manupatrafast.com.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial investigation of the logs by the development team.
2. Requested SSLsplit logs which were missing from the initial submission.
3. Scheduled remote sessions to collect logs while reproducing the issue.
4. Whitelisted certain scripts under "Denylists and Allowlists" to see if it resolved the issue.
5. Enabled debug logging during remote sessions to capture detailed information.
6. Requested the output of the command `ipconfig /all` from affected computers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the configuration of the Stealthy DPI driver, which was not functioning as expected, leading to the blocking of legitimate website access.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Stealthy DPI driver was enabled correctly. The development team confirmed that with the driver enabled, the blocking issue should not occur. The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Stealthy DPI driver is enabled when troubleshooting similar access issues.
- Always collect comprehensive logs, including SSLsplit logs, to facilitate effective troubleshooting.
- Whitelisting configurations should be reviewed to ensure they are correctly set up to avoid unnecessary blocking of legitimate traffic.
