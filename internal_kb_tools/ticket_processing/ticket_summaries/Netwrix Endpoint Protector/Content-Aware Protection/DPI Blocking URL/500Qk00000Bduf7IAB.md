- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Bduf7IAB
- **Case Number:** 411451
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in allowing specific computers or users to access domains and URLs that were listed on the Denylist in the DPI Blocking URL feature. Despite attempts to exclude the affected computer from the CAP policy, access to the blocked sites remained denied.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection enabled.
- The affected computer was initially bound to a CAP policy with a "Report Only" action.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed whether the Stealthy DPI driver was enabled for the user.
2. Checked if the computer or user was selected in any other policy that might have the URL listed in the Denylist.
3. Verified the action settings of the CAP policy, ensuring it was set to "Report Only."
4. Removed the computer from the CAP policy to test access to the blocked sites.

## Root Cause
The DPI Denylist operates as a global stand-alone policy, which does not consider the action settings of other policies (e.g., "Report Only" or "Block & Report"). Therefore, even if a computer is excluded from a policy with a "Block & Report" action, it can still be blocked by the DPI Denylist.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the affected computer from the CAP policy. Once the computer was no longer bound to any policy, it regained access to the sites listed in the Domain & URL denylist.

## Notes
- The DPI Denylist acts independently of other policies, meaning that exclusions in CAP policies do not affect its functionality.
- It is important to ensure that no other policies are conflicting with the desired access settings.
- Customers using antivirus solutions that perform SSL inspection may experience issues with DPI operations, as these can interfere with traffic inspection. Documentation regarding this interaction should be provided to customers for clarity.
