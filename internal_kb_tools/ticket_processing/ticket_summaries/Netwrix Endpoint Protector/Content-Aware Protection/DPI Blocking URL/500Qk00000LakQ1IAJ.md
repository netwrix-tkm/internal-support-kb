## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LakQ1IAJ
- **Case Number:** 435023
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Sai Nachiappan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI Blocking URL
- **Version:** None specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies were not functioning correctly on Mac devices. Specifically, file attachments were not being blocked as intended, despite the policies being applied. Other policies, such as URL blocking, were functioning correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** MacOS
- **Client Version:** 3.0.4.1
- **Server Version:** 6.2.3
- **Hosting Platform:** Hosted by EPP on AWS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the EPP client was installed on the affected Mac devices.
2. Ensured that the DPI certificate was added to the system keychain and that the EPP client had full disk access.
3. Created CAP policies to block specific file types (PDF, Word, Excel) and tested the policies.
4. Attempted to collect logs from the affected devices but encountered issues retrieving them.
5. Provided detailed instructions to the customer for gathering logs and enabling debug mode on the EPP client.
6. Requested a short video demonstrating the issue for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the CAP policies applied to the Mac devices. The policies were not effectively blocking file attachments due to potential issues with the EPP client settings or the way the policies were defined.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Ensuring that the EPP client was properly configured with the necessary permissions and settings.
2. Adjusting the CAP policies to ensure they were correctly targeting the intended file types and applications.
3. Collecting the necessary logs and analyzing them to confirm that the policies were applied correctly.
4. Conducting a remote session with the customer to verify the settings and demonstrate the correct functionality of the CAP policies.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the EPP client has full disk access and that the DPI certificate is properly installed in the keychain for CAP policies to function effectively on Mac devices.
- Future cases should include a request for a video demonstration if the issue is not easily reproducible through standard troubleshooting steps.
