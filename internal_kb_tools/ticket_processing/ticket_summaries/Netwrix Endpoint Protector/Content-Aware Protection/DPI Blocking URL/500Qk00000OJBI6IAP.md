## Problem Description
One of the client's colleagues was unable to access websites that were supposed to be on the allowlist, impacting their ability to update tickets in the ticketing system.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to a blocking upload policy configured in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the client's device to investigate the issue.
2. Reviewed the configuration of the blocking upload policy.
3. Identified that users not included in the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy could access the ticketing system without issues.
4. Noted that adding users to the CAP policy caused access issues to the ticketing system.
5. Proposed adding a DPI allowlist for the ticketing system link.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was an incorrectly configured blocking upload policy that did not account for exceptions for the ticketing system. When users were added to the CAP policy, they were blocked from accessing the necessary functionalities of the ticketing system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding a DPI allowlist entry for the ticketing system link. After implementing this change, the functionality was tested on two devices, and the client confirmed that the issue was fixed.

## Notes
- Ensure that any blocking policies have appropriate exceptions for critical applications to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update allowlists and policies to accommodate changes in business processes or applications.
