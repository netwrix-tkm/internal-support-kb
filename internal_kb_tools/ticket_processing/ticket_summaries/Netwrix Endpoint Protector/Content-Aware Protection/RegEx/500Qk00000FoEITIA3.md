## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with blocking sensitive data uploads, specifically Aadhaar and PAN card details, through various platforms including WhatsApp Web, email, and Dropbox.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the Product:** 8.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **WhatsApp Web Blocking:**
   - Attempted to block `web.whatsapp.com` URL.
   - Found that communication is encrypted, preventing monitoring by the EPP client.

2. **Email Domain Whitelisting:**
   - Allowed `mail.google.com` to permit file attachments.
   - Blocked personal email accounts from logging in.

3. **Dropbox Data Uploading:**
   - Noted that Dropbox uploads were not being blocked.
   - Restarted the Chrome browser to allow the EPP client to apply the DPI certificate to the Dropbox web page.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to the encryption of communications on WhatsApp Web, which the EPP client could not monitor. Additionally, the DPI certificate was not applied to the Dropbox web page until the browser was restarted.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Blocking the `web.whatsapp.com` URL, acknowledging that the EPP client cannot monitor encrypted communications.
- Allowing `mail.google.com` for file attachments while blocking personal accounts.
- Restarting the Chrome browser, which enabled the EPP client to apply the DPI certificate to the Dropbox web page, effectively blocking uploads.

## Notes
- Future cases involving encrypted communication platforms like WhatsApp should be approached with the understanding that monitoring may not be possible.
- Ensure that the DPI certificate is applied correctly by restarting the browser if similar issues arise with web applications.
- Regularly review and update whitelisting and blocking rules to ensure compliance with data protection policies.
