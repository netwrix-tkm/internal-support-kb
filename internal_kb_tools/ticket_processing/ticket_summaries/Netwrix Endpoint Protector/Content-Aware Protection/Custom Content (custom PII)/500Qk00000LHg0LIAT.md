- **Case Number:** 434191
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SambaSafety
- **Contact Name:** Andy Anderson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when editing or creating a new policy for MAC, the option to select users was not available, resulting in an empty user list.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the deployment of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically concerning the communication between clients due to misconfigured IP and port settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the MAC policy settings.
2. Checked the deployment scripts used for client communication.
3. Identified that the clients were not communicating properly due to the IP and port not being set correctly.
4. Confirmed that the older deployment scripts were in use.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the clients were not communicating effectively because the IP and port settings were not configured correctly during deployment, as they were using outdated scripts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying new scripts that correctly configured the IP and port settings, allowing the clients to communicate properly and populate the user list for the MAC policy.

## Notes
- Ensure that the latest deployment scripts are used to avoid similar communication issues in the future.
- Regularly verify IP and port configurations during deployment to prevent similar problems.
