- **Case Number:** 419264
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Airpak
- **Contact Name:** Stefania Oltean
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with applying Content Aware Protection (CAP) policies, stating that the policies were not being applied at all, even after attempts to reset them.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Content-Aware Protection

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the issue was conducted based on customer feedback.
2. Logs were collected from the client (COOPERATIVA JULIAN LORENTE) to analyze the failure of policy application.
3. A remote support session was proposed to further investigate the issue.
4. A test build was created and provided to the customer for testing to determine if the issue could be reproduced.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it was determined that the existing build had a defect that prevented the CAP policies from being applied correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing a test build that corrected the defect. The customer was asked to install the test build and confirm if the CAP policies were now being applied as expected. The feedback indicated that the test build successfully resolved the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure to communicate clearly with customers about the need for testing new builds to confirm resolution.
- Document any specific configurations or settings that may affect the application of CAP policies for future reference.
- Monitor similar cases for patterns that may indicate a recurring issue with specific builds or configurations.
