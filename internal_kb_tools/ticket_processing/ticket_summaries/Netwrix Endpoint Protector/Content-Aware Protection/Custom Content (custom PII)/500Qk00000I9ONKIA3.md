## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I9ONKIA3
- **Case Number:** 426640
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Laykon Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Faruk Sarı
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the word "şeker" (meaning "sugar" in English) could not be detected by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector during the monitoring of food recipes. Despite defining it as custom content and using regex, the detection failed. The customer had previously experienced similar issues with McAfee DLP.

## Environment Details
- The customer is in the Proof of Concept (POC) stage and supplies food items like cakes and sweets.
- The issue was specifically related to the CAP (Content-Aware Protection) policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Defined "şeker" as custom content and attempted regex configurations.
2. Conducted tests using various file types (TXT, PDF, Word, Excel).
3. Observed that detection only worked when the word was in uppercase in TXT files.
4. Raised an ADO (Azure DevOps) for further investigation.
5. R&D team reproduced the issue and identified it as related to character encoding.
6. Advised the customer to test with larger text files instead of single words.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be caused by character encoding detection, which used a probabilistic method. When the text was too short (e.g., a single word), the system sometimes misidentified the encoding, leading to detection failures. This problem was particularly evident in text files.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to include the word "şeker" within larger text files or multiple phrases. After conducting tests with this approach, the detections worked as expected, confirming that the character encoding was correctly determined in larger contexts.

## Notes
- For future cases involving special characters or specific words, ensure that tests are conducted with larger text samples to avoid character encoding issues.
- Monitor for similar issues with other special characters, as they may also be affected by encoding detection methods.
