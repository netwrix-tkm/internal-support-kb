## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FI88AIAT
- **Case Number:** 419918
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Southern California (USC)
- **Contact Name:** Chris Gomez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in creating a policy to block Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and donor information from being emailed through the Outlook platform, without triggering alerts for regular PII information for certain users.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Operating System:** macOS (noted requirement for DPI + DPI certificate for testing)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Discussed the requirements for blocking PII and donor information.
2. Created a policy combining one regex pattern with 3-4 PII items.
3. Set the Global Threshold to 5, meaning the policy would trigger a block if 5 or more violations occurred.
4. Configured the policy to only apply to attached upload files.

## Root Cause
The need for a specific policy configuration arose from the requirement to differentiate between regular PII and sensitive donor information, which necessitated a custom approach to policy creation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully creating a custom policy that combined regex and specific PII items. The Global Threshold was set to 5, ensuring that only significant violations would trigger a block, thus allowing for flexibility in handling regular PII information.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI and DPI certificate are added for testing on macOS in future configurations.
- Consider documenting similar use cases for future reference to streamline the policy creation process for PII detection.
