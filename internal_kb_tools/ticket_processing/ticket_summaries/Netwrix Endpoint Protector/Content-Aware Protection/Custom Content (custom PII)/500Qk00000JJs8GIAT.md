## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JJs8GIAT
- **Case Number:** 429413
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Amphenol Aerospace
- **Contact Name:** Aaron Dunn
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that PDF custom properties were not being scanned by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Tags written in Adobe Acrobat under Document Properties were not detected, while similar tags in other file types (e.g., MS Office) were successfully identified by the same CAP policy.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Issue observed in:** Adobe Acrobat PDF files

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the CAP policy to ensure it was set to scan for custom properties.
2. Tested the detection of tags in various file types, confirming that MS Office files were correctly scanned.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue with different PDF files to rule out file-specific problems.
4. Engaged development for a potential code fix after initial troubleshooting did not resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the code that prevented the scanning of custom properties in PDF files. This was confirmed after testing and analysis of the CAP functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing a code fix (ADO # 367684) that updated the scanning capabilities of the CAP policy to include custom properties in PDF files. A test build was provided to the customer, which successfully resolved the detection issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future updates to the CAP policy or scanning capabilities are tested against various file types, including PDFs, to prevent similar issues.
- The provided test build was intended for testing purposes only and should not be widely deployed until confirmed stable.
