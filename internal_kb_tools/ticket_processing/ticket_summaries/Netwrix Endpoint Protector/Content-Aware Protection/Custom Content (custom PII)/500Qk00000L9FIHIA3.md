## Problem Description
The customer reported that after adding a URL to the domain block list and including it in their production policy, they were still able to access the URL via their browser.

## Environment Details
- The customer had enabled Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on their network.
- The issue was specifically noted on macOS devices where the DPI certificate had not been imported.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the URL was correctly added to the domain block list and production policy.
2. Conducted a remote session with the customer to diagnose the issue.
3. Identified that the DPI certificate was not imported on the macOS devices.
4. Imported the DPI certificate on one machine and marked it as trusted.
5. Tested access to the blocked URL after the certificate was imported.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the DPI certificate necessary for blocking the URL was not imported on the macOS devices, preventing the DPI from functioning correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by importing the DPI certificate on the affected macOS machine and marking it as trusted. Following this, the customer was provided with a deployment guide to ensure the DPI certificate could be deployed to all machines in their environment.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI certificate is imported and marked as trusted on all devices where DPI is enabled to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is recommended to verify the deployment of the DPI certificate across all machines after making changes to the domain block list or production policies.
