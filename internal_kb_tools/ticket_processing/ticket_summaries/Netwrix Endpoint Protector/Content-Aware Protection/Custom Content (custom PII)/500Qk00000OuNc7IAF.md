- **Case Number:** 444456
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cascade Loans
- **Contact Name:** William King
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Custom Content (custom PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a content-aware policy intended to trigger an alert when an employee emails 5 or more attachments was incorrectly triggering alerts when only one attachment was sent. The customer suspected that the issue was related to attachments being on a denylist.

## Environment Details
- The policy was set to monitor Outlook emails.
- The risk score was configured to 5, and all file types were checked off.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Re-created the policy to ensure correct configuration.
2. Verified the use case: block Outlook emails containing 5 or more attachments.
3. Reviewed logs to determine why alerts were triggered on a single attachment.
4. Consulted with the engineering channel for further insights.
5. Informed the customer that the threat threshold applies to PII and not file types.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misunderstanding of how the threat threshold interacts with file types. The threat threshold does not trigger alerts based on the number of attachments but rather on the presence of sensitive information (PII) in the attachments.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying to the customer that the content-aware policy's threat threshold is designed to apply to PII rather than the number of attachments. The customer was advised to adjust their expectations and configurations accordingly.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly to customers that the threat threshold does not interact with file types in the manner they might expect.
- Future configurations should ensure that customers understand the limitations of the content-aware policies, particularly regarding attachment counts and PII detection.
