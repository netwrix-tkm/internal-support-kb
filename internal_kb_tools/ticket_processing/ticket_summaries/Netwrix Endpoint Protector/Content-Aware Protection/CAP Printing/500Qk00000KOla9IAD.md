## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the EPP OCR in MS Outlook, specifically:
1. OCR scanning was not detecting images properly.
2. OCR scanning took an excessive amount of time, causing delays in email processing, even for validated content.
3. The application would frequently show a "Not responding" message when attaching images to emails.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed specifically with the EPP MS Outlook Add-in.
- The customer was using MS Outlook to compose emails with attached images.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to observe the behavior of the OCR scanning in MS Outlook.
2. Tested the OCR functionality by uploading images via a web browser, which showed immediate detection and blocking of sensitive content without delay.
3. Tested the scenario without the EPP MS Outlook Add-in, which resolved the lag and performance issues.
4. Suggested the customer add the "Outlook" process to "Advanced Scanning Exceptions."

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily related to the EPP MS Outlook Add-in, which caused performance lags and delays during the OCR scanning process when images were attached to emails. The add-in interfered with the normal operation of Outlook, leading to the "Not responding" messages.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to add the "Outlook" process to the "Advanced Scanning Exceptions." After implementing this change, the customer reported a significant reduction in slowness during OCR scanning in Outlook.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the performance after adding processes to the exceptions list, as this can improve user experience.
- If further issues arise, consider testing with the Outlook Add-in disabled or using a test build with Windows native OCR for better performance.
- Ensure that sensitive content policies are still enforced when making changes to scanning exceptions.
