## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E0W4iIAF
- **Case Number:** 417021
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Landkreis LÃ¼chow-Dannenberg
- **Contact Name:** Jannick Teichmann
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Printing
- **Version:** Server 5.9.4.0 and Client 6.2.3.1010

## Problem Description
After updating to the latest version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (Server 5.9.4.0 and Client 6.2.3.1010), the customer reported that printing via Outlook was blocked, while printing from other applications worked without issue. Reverting to the previous client version (6.2.2.2005) resolved the printing issue.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Software Versions:** 
  - Server: 5.9.4.0
  - Client: 6.2.3.1010
- **Previous Working Client Version:** 6.2.2.2005

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by attempting to print from Outlook, which resulted in a "Content Threat Blocked" event in the console.
2. Checked the logs for details, confirming that the policy "Browser Printing" was blocking the print job.
3. Reinstalled the previous client version (6.2.2.2005), which restored printing functionality.
4. Investigated the new functionality introduced in version 6.2.3.1010 that monitors printing from Outlook.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a new functionality implemented in version 6.2.3.1010 that monitors and scans printing from Outlook. This functionality was automatically applied due to the existing CAP policy with an Outlook exit point, which resulted in the blocking of print jobs initiated from Outlook.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were recommended:
- Add the "Outlook" process to the exceptions list in the CAP policy to prevent it from being monitored and blocked during printing.
- Navigate to **System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions** and add "Outlook" to the content exceptions.

Additionally, it was noted that the Outlook AddIn is not required unless monitoring of email content is necessary. If the customer prefers to use the AddIn, a script or executable can be provided for mass installation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the latest build is used with the recommended workaround to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the customer does not wish to monitor email content, the Outlook AddIn can be omitted.
- For mass installations, a script can be provided to facilitate the installation of the Outlook AddIn without needing to uninstall and reinstall the entire EPP.
