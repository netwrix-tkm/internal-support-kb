## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C4SekIAF
- **Case Number:** 412441
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Deloitte LLP (UK)
- **Contact Name:** Sanjay Amlani
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Printing
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature on their development server, specifically regarding the inability to generate reports for client printing activities. They noted that the policy settings appeared correct, but shadowing logs were not being generated.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **License Type:** Trial license for CAP protection
- **Location:** Development server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that File Shadowing was enabled for CAP from Device Control > Computer Settings.
2. Advised the customer on the implications of using the default internal file shadow repository and recommended configuring an external repository instead.
3. Suggested testing the settings on the development server.
4. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue after initial troubleshooting did not yield results.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was indicated that the policy settings may have been too restrictive, preventing the generation of shadowing logs.

## Solution
The issue was not resolved during the initial troubleshooting phase. The customer was advised to adjust the policy settings to be less intrusive, which they attempted. Further remote sessions were scheduled to continue troubleshooting the shadowing functionality.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that File Shadowing settings are appropriately configured to avoid overly restrictive policies that may hinder functionality.
- For future cases, consider recommending the use of external file shadow repositories for larger groups of computers to prevent performance issues with the internal repository.
- Follow-up sessions may be necessary if initial troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, especially in complex configurations.
