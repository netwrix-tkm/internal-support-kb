## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000F1E9xIAF
- **Case Number:** 419342
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CTBC Bank Corp. (Canada)
- **Contact Name:** Tony Hsieh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Printing
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
A user reported being unable to print Outlook contents to network printers or save them as PDF files, while email attachments could be printed without issue. The problem was traced to a policy blocking the print jobs.

## Environment Details
- **User Environment:** Outlook application
- **Printing Method:** Network printers and PDF file generation
- **Policy Involved:** "Browser Policy" (not configured for the account)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed CAP logs to identify the cause of the printing issue.
2. Confirmed that the print jobs were being blocked by a policy labeled "Browser Policy."
3. Verified that no such policy was configured for the user experiencing the issue.
4. Investigated if other users were affected, confirming that the issue was isolated to one user.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the "Browser Policy" inadvertently blocking the printing process for the Outlook application, despite no such policy being explicitly set for the user.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a workaround that involved adding the "Outlook" process to the exception list in the system parameters. This allowed the Outlook application to bypass the blocking policy, enabling the user to print documents successfully.

**Workaround Steps:**
- Navigate to System Parameters.
- Go to Advanced Scanning Exceptions.
- Add "Outlook" to the exceptions list.
- Check the process and generate the changes.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future configurations involving content-aware protection policies are reviewed to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to monitor user reports for isolated cases to quickly identify and resolve potential policy conflicts.
