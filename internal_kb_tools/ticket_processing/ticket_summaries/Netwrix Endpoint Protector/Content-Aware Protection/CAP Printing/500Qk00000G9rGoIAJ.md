- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Printing

## Problem Description
A user (MHernandez-Lopez) reported being blocked from printing emails through Outlook due to Content-Aware Protection (CAP) settings, even when attempting to print emails that did not contain sensitive information.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** CAP Printing

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the user's printing attempts with various emails, including those without sensitive content.
2. Checked CAP settings to ensure they were configured correctly.
3. Attempted to identify any specific rules or policies that might be causing the blockage.
4. Consulted documentation for known issues related to CAP and Outlook compatibility.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem between the existing version of Outlook and the CAP settings, which resulted in unnecessary blocking of print jobs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the user's Outlook to the latest version, which improved compatibility with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's CAP feature, allowing the user to print without restrictions.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are running the latest version of Outlook to avoid similar issues with CAP in the future.
- Regularly review CAP settings and policies to ensure they align with user needs and do not inadvertently block legitimate actions.
