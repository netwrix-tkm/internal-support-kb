## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E7XC6IAN
- **Case Number:** 417392
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Squalio
- **Contact Name:** Rudolfs Bauers
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Printing
- **Version:** Server 5.9.4.0, Client 6.2.3.1010

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server and client, they were unable to print emails from Microsoft Outlook. An error message indicated that the print action was blocked.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.0
- **Client Version:** 6.2.3.1010
- **CAP Policies:** All set to "Report only"

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the updates were successfully applied to both the server and client.
2. Checked the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies to ensure they were set to "Report only" as stated by the customer.
3. Attempted to reproduce the issue by printing emails from Microsoft Outlook.
4. Reviewed the logs for any related error messages or warnings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Content-Aware Protection settings that inadvertently blocked the print action for Microsoft Outlook, despite the policies being set to "Report only."

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the Outlook process name to the Advanced printers MTP scanning exceptions. This adjustment allowed the print action to proceed without being blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future updates to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector do not inadvertently alter the CAP settings.
- Consider documenting exceptions for commonly used applications like Microsoft Outlook to prevent similar issues in the future.
