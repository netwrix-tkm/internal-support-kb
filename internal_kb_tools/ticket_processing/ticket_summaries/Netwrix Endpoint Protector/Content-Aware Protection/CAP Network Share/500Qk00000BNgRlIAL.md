## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BNgRlIAL
- **Case Number:** 410796
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alice Blue
- **Contact Name:** vijayaraghavan k
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Network Share
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the network share allow list in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Despite adding the IP address to the allow list, files were still being blocked due to the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Role:** Cyber Security Engineer
- **Company:** Alice Blue Financial Services Pvt Ltd

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the IP address was correctly added to the network share allow list.
2. Reviewed the CAP policy settings to ensure they were configured correctly.
3. Checked for any conflicting policies that might override the allow list settings.
4. Conducted tests to see if the issue persisted with different file types and access attempts.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the CAP policy settings, which was overriding the network share allow list, leading to the blocking of files even when the IP was permitted.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the CAP policy settings to ensure that the network share allow list was honored. This included:
- Modifying the CAP policy to prevent it from blocking files from the specified IP address.
- Conducting tests post-adjustment to confirm that files were no longer being blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to the CAP policy are documented and reviewed to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly audit the network share allow list and CAP policy settings to ensure they are aligned and functioning as intended.
