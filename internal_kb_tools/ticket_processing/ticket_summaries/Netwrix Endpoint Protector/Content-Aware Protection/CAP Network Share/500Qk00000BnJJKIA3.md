## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BnJJKIA3
- **Case Number:** 411838
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** CAP Network Share
- **Version:** 5.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Avis, reported that they added a network share folder to the File Location Denylist to block all outgoing file transfers from this folder. However, users were still able to download files from the folder to their PCs, which was not the desired outcome. The customer wanted to block all outgoing transfers from the network share while allowing users to upload files to it.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the configuration of the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer added the network share folder to the File Location Denylist.
2. The customer attempted to use the Network Share option in the CAP policy to restrict file transfers.
3. Clarifications were sought regarding the functionality of the Network Share exit point in CAP.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's CAP feature. The Network Share exit point applies to file transfers both to and from network shares, and there is no option to restrict transfers exclusively from the network share while allowing uploads.

## Solution
The support team confirmed that the exact use case of blocking only outgoing transfers while allowing uploads is not possible with the current configuration of the CAP feature. The closest available feature is the File Location Denylist, which the customer had already tested. Additionally, it was suggested that if the customer needed to allow file reads and block file writes, they could configure network share devices with 'Read Only' access from the Device Control module.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that while the File Location Denylist can block outgoing transfers, it does not provide the granularity to differentiate between upload and download actions.
- Future configurations should consider the limitations of the CAP feature when planning security policies for network shares.
