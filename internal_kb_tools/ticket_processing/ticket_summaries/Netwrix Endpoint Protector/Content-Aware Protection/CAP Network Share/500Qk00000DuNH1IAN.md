## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with SFTP, requesting to allow a specific URL's IP through the SFTP while blocking all other URLs. This was marked as an urgent request.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** Content-Aware Protection for Network Share

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the SFTP configuration settings to identify the current allow/block list.
2. Verified the IP address of the specific URL that needed to be allowed.
3. Attempted to modify the allow list to include the specified IP address.
4. Tested the SFTP connection to ensure that the changes were effective.
5. Confirmed that all other URLs remained blocked as per the customer's request.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the existing SFTP configuration, which did not have the specified URL's IP address included in the allow list. This resulted in the customer's inability to access the SFTP service from that particular IP.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Updating the SFTP configuration to include the specified URL's IP address in the allow list.
- Conducting tests to ensure that the SFTP connection was successful from the allowed IP while confirming that other URLs remained blocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future requests for IP allow/block list modifications are documented clearly to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to regularly review and update the allow/block lists to maintain security and functionality.
- Customers should be informed about the potential impact of changes to SFTP configurations on their overall network security.
