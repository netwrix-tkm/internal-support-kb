## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D4eLyIAJ
- **Case Number:** 414948
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Booking.com
- **Contact Name:** Serhat Demir
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature is enabled on the endpoint, it allows support for deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites. This behavior compromises security compared to the default browser settings when DPI is disabled.

## Environment Details
- **Client Version Tested:** EPP Agent v3.0.3.0024
- **Browsers Tested:** Chrome and Firefox

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the issue and confirmed it was under investigation by the development team.
2. A test build was prepared to address the use of weak cipher suites and deprecated TLS versions.
3. The customer was provided with download links for the test builds for both Windows and Mac:
   - Windows: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v6.2.4.1004.zip)
   - Mac: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EPPMac3.0.4.1004.Notarized.tar)
4. The customer tested the new build and provided feedback on the results.

## Root Cause
The DPI feature was enabling deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites due to the configuration of the underlying OpenSSL library used in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the OpenSSL library to version 3.0 LTS in the test builds, which disabled support for deprecated TLS protocols (TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1) and removed some weak cipher suites. The customer confirmed that deprecated TLS versions were disabled when DPI was enabled after testing the new build.

## Notes
- The customer noted that while deprecated TLS versions were disabled, there were still weak cipher suites supported when DPI was enabled compared to the default browser behavior. Further improvements in this area were suggested for future consideration.
- It is important to ensure that any test builds are not deployed on a mass scale in production environments until fully validated.
