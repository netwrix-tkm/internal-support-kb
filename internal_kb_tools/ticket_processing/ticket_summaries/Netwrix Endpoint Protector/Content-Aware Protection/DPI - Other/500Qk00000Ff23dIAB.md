- **Case Number:** 420772
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Sai Nachiappan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that enabling the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature in the global settings of Netwrix Endpoint Protector caused internet access issues for Linux users. When DPI was enabled, users experienced errors accessing the internet, but disabling DPI resolved the issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically affecting Linux users.
- The affected systems had Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux (KESL) installed, with different versions noted between affected and unaffected systems.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team communicated with the customer to gather logs from both affected and unaffected systems.
2. A remote session was scheduled to capture logs from both types of systems.
3. The customer was advised to disable Kaspersky's Web Threat Protection (WTP) and Network Threat Protection (NTP) features to test compatibility with DPI.
4. Feedback was collected from the development team regarding the incompatibility between Kaspersky's features and Endpoint Protector's DPI.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incompatibility between Kaspersky's features (specifically WTP and NTP) and the DPI feature of Endpoint Protector. Both Kaspersky and Endpoint Protector were attempting to proxy traffic, leading to conflicts and internet access issues.

## Solution
The recommended solution was to disable the incompatible features in Kaspersky (WTP and NTP) to allow DPI to function correctly. The support team also suggested testing Endpoint Protector without Kaspersky installed to rule out any issues on the Endpoint Protector side.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all components (EPP settings, KESL settings, and client versions) are identical when troubleshooting issues related to DPI and Kaspersky.
- Future cases involving Kaspersky and DPI should consider the version of Kaspersky being used, as changes in firewall rules between versions can impact compatibility.
- If similar issues arise, it may be beneficial to gather logs from both affected and unaffected systems to compare configurations and identify discrepancies.
