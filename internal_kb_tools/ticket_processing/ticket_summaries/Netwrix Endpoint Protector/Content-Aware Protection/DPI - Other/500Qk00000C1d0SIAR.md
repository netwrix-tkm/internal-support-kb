## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue accessing the URL [https://public.cyber.mil/](https://public.cyber.mil/) when using a client certificate stored on a smart card via a CAC reader. The issue occurred specifically when Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) was enabled, preventing the use of their certificate.

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered while using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The client certificate was stored on a smart card accessed through a CAC reader.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Recommended upgrading the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client to the latest version "v6.2.2.1" for DPI improvements.
2. Suggested enabling "Peer Certificate Validation" and "DPI Bypass" under "DPI Configuration".
3. Advised adding the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under "Denylists and Allowlists" > "Allowlists" > "Deep Packet Inspection".
4. Instructed to select the domain under "Policy Denylists" > "Domain and URL" of an active Content Aware Policy.
5. Collected diagnostic logs after enabling debug logging and reproducing the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the DPI configuration settings that were preventing the proper use of the client certificate stored on the smart card when accessing the specified URL.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing the following changes:
- Upgrading the EPP client to version "v6.2.2.1".
- Enabling "Peer Certificate Validation" and "DPI Bypass" in the DPI configuration settings.
- Adding the domain 'public.cyber.mil' and its variations to the allowlist, ensuring that all relevant checkboxes under "Peer Certificate Validation" were checked.

## Notes
- Ensure that all relevant domains are added to the allowlist to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Monitor for any updates or patches that may affect DPI settings and client certificate usage.
- It is advisable to test configurations in a controlled environment before deploying changes to production systems.
