## Problem Description
Some users were unable to upload PDF files on Outlook and other sites when Data Loss Prevention (DPI) was enabled globally. The issue was reported by the customer, who requested assistance to resolve the problem.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in an environment where multiple policies were applied to users, potentially causing conflicts in file upload permissions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team scheduled a call with the customer to discuss the issue.
2. During the call, the support team reviewed the policies applied to the users.
3. It was identified that the PDF file type was blocked in a policy related to social media.
4. The support team disabled the PDF blocking in the social media policy.
5. The issue was tested after the policy change, confirming that users could now upload PDF files successfully.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between multiple policies applied to the users. Specifically, the PDF file type was blocked in a policy that was not intended for Outlook, leading to the upload failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the policies to ensure that the PDF file type was not blocked in the relevant policies. Specifically, the blocking of PDF uploads in the social media policy was disabled, which allowed users to upload PDF files on Outlook without issues.

## Notes
- It is important to review all policies applied to users when troubleshooting similar issues, as conflicts can arise from multiple policies affecting the same file types.
- Future configurations should ensure that policies are clearly defined to avoid unintended blocking of file types across different applications.
