## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EPMy9IAH
- **Case Number:** 418049
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Delta Sucroenergia
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that enabling Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on their Netwrix Endpoint Protector caused significant server slowdowns, rendering the server nearly inaccessible.

## Environment Details
- The EPP Server was experiencing 100% CPU usage when DPI was enabled.
- The issue was isolated to one specific machine within the customer's environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to enable logging on two computers that were generating a high volume of events.
2. Logs were collected after allowing DPI to run for 30 minutes to capture relevant data.
3. The support team analyzed the logs to identify any anomalies or excessive logging behavior.
4. A remote session was proposed to further investigate the server's performance and resource utilization.
5. The customer was instructed to test the server performance with DPI disabled and with the stealthy DPI driver enabled.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a specific machine generating excessive logs when DPI was enabled, leading to high CPU usage on the EPP Server.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by updating to a newer version of the EPP Client, which improved performance and reduced CPU load when DPI was enabled. Additionally, it was confirmed that the issue only occurred with DPI enabled, and slight improvements were noted when the stealthy DPI driver was activated.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the number of logs generated by clients when DPI is enabled to prevent server overload.
- Future cases should consider checking for duplicated devices and excessive logging behavior on specific machines.
- Ensure that the latest client versions are being used to mitigate performance issues related to DPI.
