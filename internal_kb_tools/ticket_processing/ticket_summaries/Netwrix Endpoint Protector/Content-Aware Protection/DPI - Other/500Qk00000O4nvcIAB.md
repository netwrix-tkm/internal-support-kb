## Problem Description
The customer reported that Excel exhibited strange behavior, becoming slower when a specific policy was enabled. The issues included delays in changing cells and using the clipboard. When the policy was disabled, Excel functioned normally.

## Environment Details
- The Excel file was stored locally on the computer, eliminating network sharing issues.
- The policy in question did not generate any reports, complicating troubleshooting efforts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made with the customer to schedule a remote session for troubleshooting.
2. A remote session was attempted on April 17, 2025, but the customer did not join.
3. Follow-up emails were sent to reschedule the remote session.
4. Multiple attempts were made to reach the customer for further troubleshooting, including sending Zoom links for remote sessions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not identified during the troubleshooting process. The lack of reports generated by the policy made it difficult to diagnose the problem effectively.

## Solution
The case was closed without a definitive resolution due to the customer's lack of response and participation in scheduled sessions. The support engineer communicated that the customer could reach out if the issue persisted.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure timely communication and follow-up with customers to avoid delays in troubleshooting.
- Future cases involving performance issues with specific policies should consider checking for any updates or patches related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector that may address similar issues.
- Encourage customers to provide detailed feedback on their experiences with policies to assist in identifying potential root causes.
