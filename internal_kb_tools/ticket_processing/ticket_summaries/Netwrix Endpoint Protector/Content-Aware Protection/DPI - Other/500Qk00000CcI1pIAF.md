- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AEON Specialized Bank (Cambodia) PLC
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection

- **Version:** Server 5930

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to see logs in the CAP (Content-Aware Protection) report within the EPP (Endpoint Protector) console. Despite successful communication with the server and the application of policies, the logs were not appearing in the expected reports.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted by CoSOSys.
- The URL for the server is: [https://d2mc5es.hosted.endpointprotector.com/](https://d2mc5es.hosted.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the client was communicating with the server.
2. Confirmed that all policies were functioning correctly and generating pop-ups on the client machine.
3. Checked that new policies and changes to existing policies were being applied on the PC client.
4. Observed that logs were visible in the Log Report (e.g., "Policy Received") but not in the CAP report.
5. Noted that the last log entry in the CAP report was from June 26, 2024, with no subsequent entries.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of a bug in the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1, which caused the system to stop processing certain events, including CAP logs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying Hotfix 1.1, which corrected the logging functionality in the CAP report. The customer confirmed that after applying this hotfix, the logs began to appear as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the deployment of hotfixes, as they may introduce new issues. In this case, the initial hotfix caused the logging problem.
- Future updates should be tested in a controlled environment before widespread deployment to prevent similar issues.
