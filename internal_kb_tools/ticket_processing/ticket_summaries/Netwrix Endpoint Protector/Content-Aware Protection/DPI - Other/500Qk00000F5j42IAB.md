- **Case Number:** 419522
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Secure Gate (@securegate.com.br)
- **Contact Name:** Tiago Guerra
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The client reported issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) where filling out forms resulted in the loss of information when a block occurred. Instead of displaying a pop-up alert, a new, unfamiliar page appeared, causing confusion and data loss. Additionally, the justification pop-up was not consistently displayed, particularly after a 15-minute interval during lengthy document work sessions.

## Environment Details
- **Client Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Functionality Affected:** Pop-up notifications and form handling during blocking events.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings of the EPP client to ensure they aligned with global rights.
2. Checked for any recent updates or changes in functionality that could affect pop-up behavior.
3. Conducted tests to replicate the issue by filling out forms and triggering block events.
4. Reviewed logs for any errors or warnings related to pop-up notifications and blocking behavior.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the computers not adhering to the global rights settings, which led to improper handling of pop-up notifications and blocking events.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the computers were correctly configured to follow the global rights settings. This adjustment allowed the pop-up notifications to function as intended, preventing data loss during form submissions and ensuring that justification pop-ups appeared consistently.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly verify that all client machines are aligned with global rights settings to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Clients should be informed about the potential for data loss during blocking events and encouraged to save their work frequently.
