## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OOh61IAD
- **Case Number:** 443020
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrivatBank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported an issue with the Data Protection Interception (DPI) functionality on macOS devices after migrating to a new Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) instance. The DPI certificate was not replacing correctly in the browser, despite being marked as "Enabled" and "Trusted" in the client UI. The issue persisted even after changing the certificate in their JAMF profile and pushing it to the computers.

## Environment Details
- The client upgraded to the latest EPP version 5.9.4.2.
- The issue primarily affected users working remotely via Cisco VPN.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the PrivatBank team to investigate the issue.
2. Verified that the DPI certificate was not applied when users were connected to the VPN.
3. Checked full disk access, accessibility, and Bluetooth access for the Endpoint Protector application.
4. Enabled intercept VPN traffic in the console settings and attempted to update policies.
5. Tested the functionality with a blocked website (dropbox.com) and confirmed that a different certificate (Cisco Umbrella) was being used.
6. Conducted tests on DLPTEST.COM to verify policy application.
7. Gathered logs and screenshots of the JAMF setup used for certificate deployment.
8. Attempted to manually remove the existing certificate and replace it with a PEM file instead of a CER file.

## Root Cause
The DPI certificate was not being applied correctly when users were connected to the corporate network via VPN. The issue was exacerbated by the use of a .cer file instead of the required .pem file for certificate deployment through JAMF.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Creating a new JAMF profile following best practices for VPN configuration, ensuring all necessary settings were correctly applied.
- Deploying the correct .pem certificate file instead of the .cer file.
- Conducting further tests to confirm that the DPI functionality worked correctly when users were connected to the corporate network.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct certificate file type (.pem) is used for deployment in JAMF profiles to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the application of policies when users switch between corporate and non-corporate networks, especially when using VPN.
- Consider scheduling regular follow-ups with clients after significant changes to their EPP configurations to ensure continued functionality.
