## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MZxF6IAL
- **Case Number:** 437764
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IPRO SIA
- **Contact Name:** Elena Revzina
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The client reported an issue with integrating the DPI feature into the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). Users were unable to access any resources when using the Mozilla Firefox browser with DPI enabled, while other browsers functioned normally. The client sought clarification on whether this behavior was expected and if there was a way to bypass or resolve the issue.

## Environment Details
- Primary browser in the client's environment: Mozilla Firefox
- Other browsers were functioning correctly with DPI enabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the partner to investigate the issue.
2. Confirmed that the issue with Mozilla Firefox was resolved internally on the customer side.
3. Discussed the behavior of Content Aware Protection "Report Only" policies in conjunction with DPI denied lists.
4. Tested and observed that denied web domains were still blocked under a Report Only CAP Policy.
5. Suggested a workaround to create a CAP Report Only policy with relevant file types selected to allow users to send/share documents while logging these actions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was confirmed that the issue with Mozilla Firefox was resolved on the customer side, indicating that it may have been related to internal configurations or settings rather than a defect in the Netwrix product itself.

## Solution
The issue was resolved internally by the customer. As a workaround for visibility of content being transferred, it was recommended to create a CAP Report Only policy with relevant file types selected. This allows users to send/share documents while logging these actions under the Content Aware Report.

## Notes
- It is important to note that denied web domains will still be blocked under a Report Only CAP Policy, which may affect user access if not properly configured.
- Future users experiencing similar issues with Mozilla Firefox and DPI should consider checking internal configurations and testing with CAP Report Only policies for visibility of actions.
