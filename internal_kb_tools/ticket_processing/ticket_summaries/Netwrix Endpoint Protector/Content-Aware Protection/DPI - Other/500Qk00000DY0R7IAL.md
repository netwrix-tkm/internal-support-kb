- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
A few users reported encountering the "ERR_connection_closed" error while attempting to access various websites. The issue was intermittent and resolved temporarily by reloading the agent.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in a corporate environment using Google Chrome as the browser.
- The error was linked to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs from affected users to analyze the error.
2. Verified the configuration settings related to Peer Certificate Validation and DPI bypass.
3. Attempted to reproduce the issue by accessing the reported websites (e.g., okta.booking.com and dban.org).
4. Provided a test build of the software to the customer for further testing.
5. Suggested potential configuration changes, including bypassing invalid peer certificates and using URL allowlists.

## Root Cause
The "ERR_connection_closed" error was primarily caused by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's DPI feature, which dropped connections when encountering invalid SSL certificates. The Peer Certificate Validation settings were configured in a way that did not allow bypassing invalid certificates, leading to the connection issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a fix included in version 5.9.4.1 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. After the update, the customer was advised to test the functionality again, and confirmation was received that the issue was addressed.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the Peer Certificate Validation settings are appropriately configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Users should be informed that bypassing invalid certificates can pose security risks and should be carefully considered.
- If similar issues arise, check for updates or patches that may address known bugs related to SSL certificate handling in the DPI feature.
