## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple disk space errors on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) platform, which caused the system to go down frequently. Previous support cases related to this issue were closed without resolution.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted by Netwrix.
- The issue was primarily related to disk space being consumed by an nginx log file.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reported periodic disk space notifications.
2. Support team investigated the disk space usage.
3. Confirmed the presence of an nginx log file that was increasing in size.
4. Removed the nginx log file and disabled nginx logging to prevent future issues.
5. Updated the nginx configuration file to ensure proper logging management.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the disk space issue was identified as an nginx log file that was not being managed properly, leading to excessive disk space consumption.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the problematic nginx log file.
- Disabling nginx logging to prevent the log file from filling up the disk space in the future.
- Updating the nginx configuration file to ensure that logging is handled appropriately going forward.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor log file sizes and implement log rotation or management strategies to prevent similar disk space issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to regularly check disk space usage and configure logging settings to avoid unexpected system downtimes.
