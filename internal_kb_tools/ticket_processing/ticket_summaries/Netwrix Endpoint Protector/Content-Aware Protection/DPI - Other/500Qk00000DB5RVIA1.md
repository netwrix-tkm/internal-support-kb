## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in restricting users from deleting their own data within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the EPP agent's inability to block users from deleting files.
- The customer was interested in monitoring file deletion actions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the EPP agent does not have the capability to block file deletion by users.
2. Suggested the use of the File Tracing feature to monitor file actions, including deletions.
3. Provided information on how File Tracing can monitor data traffic between protected endpoints and various storage devices.

## Root Cause
The EPP agent is designed to monitor file actions but does not have the functionality to prevent users from deleting their own files.

## Solution
- Informed the customer that while the EPP agent cannot block file deletions, it can utilize the File Tracing feature to monitor such actions.
- Explained how to enable File Tracing from Device Control, Global Settings, or for specific Groups or Computers.

## Notes
- It is important to note that while monitoring can provide insights into file actions, it does not prevent users from performing deletions.
- Future configurations should consider user permissions and roles to manage data protection effectively.
