## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OMK2HIAX
- **Case Number:** 442887
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ABNR Counsellors at Law
- **Contact Name:** Robby Sirwaturai
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010; Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that while trying to access the URL `https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor`, the captcha required for login did not appear. The issue persisted until the customer uninstalled the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client, after which the captcha appeared.

## Environment Details
- **Client OS:** Windows 11 24H2
- **Agent Version:** 6.2.3.1010
- **Server Version:** EPP hosted, version 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the DPI Configuration settings to ensure "Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements" was active.
2. Added `apps.pertamina.com` and `*.pertamina.com` to the "Default DPI Bypass List".
3. Updated policies on the client by right-clicking the EPP icon in the system tray.
4. Closed all browsers, waited a few seconds, and reopened the URL; the captcha still did not appear.
5. Uninstalled the EPP client, closed all browsers, reopened the URL, and confirmed the captcha appeared.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a caching/indexing problem related to the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) settings of the EPP client, which prevented the captcha from loading correctly.

## Solution
During a remote session, the support team successfully resolved the issue by:
1. Uninstalling the existing EPP client.
2. Removing the Stealthy DPI driver from the DPI module.
3. Reinstalling the latest version of the EPP client (6.2.4.2) to ensure proper functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure that the latest version of the EPP client is installed to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the captcha does not appear, check DPI settings and consider uninstalling the EPP client as a temporary workaround.
- Always collect logs before uninstalling the client for further analysis if needed.
