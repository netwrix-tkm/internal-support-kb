- **Case Number:** 441472
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baader Bank

- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer was experiencing issues with the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) feature on selected computers. Specifically, when the "Ignore Trust" option was disabled, external websites could not be accessed, while internal websites were still resolvable. The customer was unable to see warnings for websites with invalid certificates (e.g., expired or DNS mismatch).

## Environment Details
- The customer is using a Cisco proxy in their network configuration.
- The DPI feature was being implemented on selected machines.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer disabled the following options:
   - Ignore Expiration Date
   - Ignore Trust
   - Ignore Hostname
2. A call was held with the customer to explain the functionality of the "Ignore Trust" option.
3. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the customer's network configuration and the use of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) approach for certificate validation. When the "Ignore Trust" option is disabled, the system cannot validate certificates from external proxies (like Cisco), leading to the inability to access external websites.

## Solution
During the support call, it was explained to the customer that enabling the "Ignore Trust" option is necessary when using a proxy to allow the system to bypass certificate validation. The customer confirmed that enabling this option resolved the issue, allowing access to external websites.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers using proxies that disabling the "Ignore Trust" option may lead to connectivity issues with external websites.
- Future cases involving similar configurations should consider the implications of certificate validation in a MITM setup.
