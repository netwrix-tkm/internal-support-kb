## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to save a dictionary of business domains under the DPI Bypass list when attempting to add it to the allow list in a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy. Upon editing the policy, the dictionary was not visible as selected.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically within the Content-Aware Protection feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to add the DPI Allowlist dictionary to the CAP policy.
2. Upon saving the policy, the dictionary was not retained.
3. The customer referenced a similar bug related to the Email Domain Dictionary.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a bug in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector software that prevented the DPI Allowlist dictionary from being saved after editing the CAP policy. This bug was confirmed by the Product team.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that the fix for the DPI Whitelist issue would be included in the upcoming Endpoint Protector release, version 5.9.4.1, which was in the final stages of testing and scheduled for release in December 2024. In the meantime, the customer was advised to re-select the DPI Allowlist dictionaries each time they made changes to the CAP policies before saving.

## Notes
- This issue does not affect the overall functionality of the product or its ability to apply policies correctly; it is primarily a display issue.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be informed of the workaround until the fix is released.
