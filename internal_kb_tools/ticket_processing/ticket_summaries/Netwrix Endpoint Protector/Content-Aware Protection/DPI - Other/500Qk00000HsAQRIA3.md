## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HsAQRIA3
- **Case Number:** 425959
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Trustly
- **Contact Name:** Rodrigo Monteiro
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** 9.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported significant upload speed issues experienced by several employees after activating Content Aware Protection Policies in Endpoint Protector, specifically with a blocklist for personal emails and shared drives. They inquired whether the blocklist could be the cause of these issues and sought guidance on resolving them.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Users:** Multiple employees at Trustly
- **Network Speed Before Issue:** Approximately 600 Mbps
- **Network Speed After Issue:** Dropped to less than 1 Mbps

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the blocklist for personal emails and shared drives should not typically cause significant upload speed issues.
2. Inquired whether Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) was enabled, as it may cause a minor reduction in upload speed.
3. Suggested checking if the Intercept VPN Traffic option was turned ON or OFF for affected users.
4. Proposed a remote session to make configuration changes and observe the impact on upload speed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the upload speed issues was identified as the combination of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) being enabled along with specific Content Aware Protection rules. This combination led to a drastic reduction in upload speeds for users.

## Solution
During a remote session, the Intercept VPN Traffic option was enabled. This adjustment restored the upload speed to normal levels. It was noted that enabling this option while DPI is active allows for proper handling of VPN traffic on macOS using the network extension framework.

## Notes
- Users may receive a notification to allow the network extension in the future; they should be instructed to allow it.
- The Intercept VPN Traffic setting can be applied at a group level for all users with the Content Aware Protection policy enabled.
- Future configurations should consider the impact of DPI in conjunction with specific rules to avoid similar issues.
