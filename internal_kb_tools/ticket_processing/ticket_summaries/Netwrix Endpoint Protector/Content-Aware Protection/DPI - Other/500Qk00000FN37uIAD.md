- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** v5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the ability to view the names of files uploaded to Dropbox via a web browser. They reported that while some XML files were visible, most files were only identified as PDF files without specific names.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector version v5.9.4.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logging capabilities of Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding file uploads.
2. Analyzed the XML files to determine if they contained detailed file names.
3. Checked the configuration settings for Content-Aware Protection to ensure proper logging of file uploads.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the limitations of the logging feature in the current version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which did not capture detailed file names for all file types uploaded to Dropbox.

## Solution
The support team provided information regarding the logging capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. It was clarified that while some file types could be logged with specific names, others, particularly PDFs, were logged generically without detailed identification. The customer was advised to consider upgrading to a newer version or checking for additional logging configurations that might enhance visibility into file uploads.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that the logging capabilities may vary by file type and that not all uploads will display detailed file names.
- Consideration for future upgrades or enhancements to the logging features may be beneficial for users needing comprehensive file tracking.
