- **Case Number:** 435199
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PremiaLab
- **Contact Name:** Ivan Ip
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to enable Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on the client side using their Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. Despite successfully downloading and deploying the DPI certificate, the status in the "Certificate added to Keychain/store" column remained "N/A", preventing the application of DPI rules.

## Environment Details
- The customer utilized their own MDM solution for certificate deployment.
- The DPI certificate was downloaded from the Netwrix control panel.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the successful download of the DPI certificate from the control panel.
2. Confirmed that the certificate was deployed with ultimate trust using the customer's MDM solution.
3. Checked the status of the certificate in the "Certificate added to Keychain/store" column, which displayed "N/A".
4. Attempted to filter by DPI rules, which was unsuccessful.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix system, which does not support customers using custom Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) for hosted instances. This restriction is in place to protect customer anonymity and prevent targeted DDoS attacks. Additionally, the use of custom Certificate Authority (CA) certificates was not permitted, as the DNS records for hosted instances are managed by Netwrix, making validation of custom domains impossible.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that the use of custom FQDNs and CA certificates is not supported. The customer was advised to utilize the standard Netwrix-provided certificates and DNS configurations to enable DPI functionality correctly.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that using custom FQDNs or CA certificates with Netwrix hosted instances is not supported.
- It is crucial to follow the standard deployment procedures provided by Netwrix to ensure proper functionality of features like DPI.
- Future cases involving DPI issues should first verify compliance with Netwrix's certificate and domain policies before proceeding with troubleshooting.
