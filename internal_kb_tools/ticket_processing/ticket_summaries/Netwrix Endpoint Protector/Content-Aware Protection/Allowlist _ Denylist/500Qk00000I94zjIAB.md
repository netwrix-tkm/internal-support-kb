## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I94zjIAB
- **Case Number:** 426627
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Government (Malta)
- **Contact Name:** Glenn Bilocca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 10.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the deployment of content-aware Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for IBAN accounts was not functioning as expected, specifically that the intended blocking of sensitive data was not occurring. This was the third issue encountered within two weeks, and the customer needed the software deployed by the end of the month.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue was specifically related to the Content-Aware Protection feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Remote Session Setup:** A remote session was arranged to investigate the issue further.
2. **Log File Review:** The support engineer reviewed log files to identify potential issues.
3. **Policy Adjustments:** The customer was advised to remove DPI Monitored URL categories from the CAP policy, save the changes, and update the policy.
4. **EPP Add-in Check:** The customer was instructed to check if the EPP add-in was enabled in Outlook.
5. **Client Installation:** The customer was advised to uninstall the current client and download a new client, ensuring the "Install with Outlook Add-on" option was selected during installation.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the absence of the EPP add-in for Outlook, which is necessary for the Content-Aware DLP to function correctly within that application.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer:
- Uninstalled the existing client.
- Downloaded and installed a new client from the UI, ensuring that the "Install with Outlook Add-on" option was checked during installation.

After these steps, the content-aware DLP functionality was confirmed to be working correctly, including blocking sensitive data in both Chrome and Outlook.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP add-in is installed and enabled in Outlook for the Content-Aware DLP to function properly.
- It is advisable to verify the configuration of the CAP policy and any related settings after installation to prevent similar issues in the future.
