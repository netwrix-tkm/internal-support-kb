## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FH5igIAD
- **Case Number:** 419887
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hub International Limited
- **Contact Name:** Ebenezer Brew
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 (upgraded to 5940)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that DPI Allowlists were not being applied after upgrading the EPP server to version 5940.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) allowlists within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Edited the Cap Policy.
2. Re-selected the DPI Allowlist items.
3. Saved the changes.
4. Verified that the allowlist items were not present upon re-checking the policy.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a visual bug in the user interface where the allowlist dictionaries did not remain checked after being selected. Although the selections were not visually confirmed in the UI, they were still applied in the backend.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the allowlist items were indeed being applied despite not appearing checked in the UI. A fix for the visual bug was scheduled for the next release (version 5.9.4.1), which was expected to be deployed in November 2024.

## Notes
- It is important to always check "Allowlist Files" and/or "Deep Packet Inspection" for the Policy Allowlist to ensure that the desired settings are applied, even if they do not appear checked in the UI.
- Customers should be informed of the visual bug and reassured that the settings are being applied correctly despite the UI issue.
- Follow up with customers after the release of the fix to confirm that the issue has been resolved from their end.
