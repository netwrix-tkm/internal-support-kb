## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ORAsEIAX
- **Case Number:** 443168
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** YOKOHAMA INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED
- **Contact Name:** Vipin Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a persistent notification regarding performance issues related to the use of long allow/deny lists in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) system. The message indicated that using a large number of long lists could affect EPP Client performance and recommended keeping lists concise for optimal performance.

## Environment Details
- **Client:** YOKOHAMA INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED
- **Concern:** Difficulty in setting up an allowlist and confusion regarding the performance notification banner.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message displayed in the allow/deny list.
2. Conducted a remote session with the client to discuss the notification and its implications.
3. Clarified that the message was a recommendation rather than a warning about actual performance issues.
4. Confirmed that the client was not experiencing any functional problems with the allow/deny lists.

## Root Cause
The notification was a standard recommendation from the EPP server, advising users to maintain concise allow/deny lists to prevent potential performance degradation. The client misunderstood this message as an indication of a problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Educating the client about the nature of the notification, clarifying that it was not indicative of a current problem but rather a best practice recommendation.
- Providing reassurance that their allowlist/denylist setup was functioning correctly.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly to clients that performance notifications are recommendations aimed at optimizing system performance rather than alerts indicating immediate issues.
- Future support interactions should emphasize the importance of concise allow/deny lists to prevent potential performance impacts, even if no immediate issues are present.
