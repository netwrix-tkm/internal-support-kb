- **Case Number:** 444832
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Solar Atmospheres, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Lawrence Yeziorski
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in blocking email attachments to free email services (e.g., Gmail) while allowing only specific users within their company to send attachments. They were unsure of the correct method to implement this configuration using the Denylists feature.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue was related to the configuration of email attachment restrictions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to use the Denylists feature in the email tab but found it could not be added to Content Aware Protection (CAP).
2. Support informed the customer that Endpoint Protector does not support the exact configuration they were looking for.
3. Provided guidance on restricting access to Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs.
4. Instructed the customer to navigate to:
   - Content Aware Protection > Deep Packet Inspection > Deep Packet Inspection Ports & Settings.
5. Explained how to select "Gmail" in the "Select Parser" dropdown.
6. Guided the customer on adding allowed business domains under "Allowed Domains for Google Business Accounts" and saving changes.
7. Noted that any Google domain not listed would be blocked from accessing Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a limitation in the Endpoint Protector's configuration capabilities, which does not allow for granular control over email attachments based on specific domains while using Denylists.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing a workaround that involved:
- Restricting access to Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs to only approved business accounts.
- Configuring the settings in the Deep Packet Inspection section to allow specific business domains while blocking all others.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the Denylists feature is global and does not allow for domain-specific configurations.
- Customers should be advised to regularly review their allowed domains to ensure compliance with their security policies.
- Future inquiries regarding similar configurations should be directed to the workaround provided, as the current version of Endpoint Protector does not support the requested feature directly.
