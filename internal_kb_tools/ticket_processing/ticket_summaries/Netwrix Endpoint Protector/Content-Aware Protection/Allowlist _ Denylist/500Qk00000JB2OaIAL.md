## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JB2OaIAL
- **Case Number:** 429099
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer is conducting a Proof of Concept (PoC) and requires assistance with two main issues:
1. Blocking password-protected/encrypted PDF files from being sent through all exit points.
2. Preventing confidential and highly confidential classified files from being sent to external domains while allowing them within the internal domain via the Outlook desktop application.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection features.
- The CAP policy configurations were set up for both blocking and reporting actions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **CAP Policy Configuration for PDF Blocking:**
   - Action: Block & Report
   - Exit points: Web Application, Email Application
   - Policy Denylist: File type -> Office2003+/Password
   - Result: Password-protected PDF files were not being blocked.

2. **CAP Policy Configuration for Classified Files:**
   - Action: Block & Report
   - Exit points: Web Application, Email Application -> Outlook (Attachment)
   - Policy Denylist: Custom Content -> Classification (~HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL~)
   - Policy Allowlist: E-mail Domain -> internal (ctbcbank.co.id)
   - Result: Classified files sent to internal domain recipients were blocked, with logged destination details.

## Root Cause
The initial configuration for blocking password-protected PDF files was not effective due to the specific file type settings in the CAP policy. The policy did not account for all variations of password protection/encryption that could be applied to PDF files.

## Solution
To resolve the issue:
1. **For Blocking Password-Protected PDFs:**
   - Update the CAP policy to include a broader range of file types and encryption methods in the Denylist. This may involve specifying additional file types or using more general criteria for identifying password-protected files.

2. **For Allowing Internal Transfers of Classified Files:**
   - Ensure that the allowlist is correctly configured to include the specific logged format of the recipient's email address. This may involve adjusting the policy to recognize the internal domain format accurately.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review and update CAP policies to ensure they align with evolving security requirements and file types.
- Future configurations should consider testing with various file types and encryption methods to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Document any changes made to policies for future reference and troubleshooting.
