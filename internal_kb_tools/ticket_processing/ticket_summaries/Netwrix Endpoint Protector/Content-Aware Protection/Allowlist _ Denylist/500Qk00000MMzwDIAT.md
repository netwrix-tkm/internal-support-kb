- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** CoreWin Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 6.0

## Problem Description
The customer, AsiaBank, inquired about the possibility of excluding specific printers from Content-Aware Protection (CAP) scanning. They wanted to allow certain printers for a department to enable users to print documents freely, similar to the existing feature for USB devices.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Name:** AsiaBank
- **Feature in Question:** Allowlist for printers within Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current capabilities of Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding printer exclusions.
2. Confirmed that the allowlist feature is currently only available for storage devices, not for printers.
3. Documented findings and communicated with the customer regarding the limitations.

## Root Cause
The inability to exclude specific printers from CAP scanning is due to the current design of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which only supports allowlisting for storage devices.

## Solution
Since the feature to exclude printers is not available, a feature request was submitted to the product team for consideration. The request can be tracked at the following link: [Feature Request](https://netwrix.productboard.com/insights/notes/view/2206-all-notes/notes/46693434).

- It is advisable to keep track of feature requests and updates from the product team for any changes in capabilities related to printer management in future releases.
