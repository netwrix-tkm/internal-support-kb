- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with excessive "Content Threat Blocked" logs for Facebook.com, despite users not visiting the site. This behavior was unexpected and had not occurred previously.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The customer had a denylist that was functioning correctly until the recent spike in logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to attempt to reproduce the issue, but it could not be replicated.
2. Advised the customer to generate EPP client logs to capture the behavior.
3. Provided commands to generate logs on Mac:
   ```bash
   sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
   sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
   sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
   sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
   ```
4. Instructed the customer to reproduce the issue and collect relevant log files.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as websites calling Facebook in the background for advertising purposes, which triggered the content threat alerts even when users were not directly visiting Facebook.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the alerts were due to background calls from other websites to Facebook, rather than direct user activity. The customer acknowledged this explanation and confirmed that the ticket could be closed.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for similar behavior in the future, as background calls from third-party websites can lead to false positives in content threat logs.
- Customers should be advised to check for such background calls when experiencing unexpected content threat alerts.
