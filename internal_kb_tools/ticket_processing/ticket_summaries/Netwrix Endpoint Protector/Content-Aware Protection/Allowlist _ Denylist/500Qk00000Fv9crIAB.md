## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fv9crIAB
- **Case Number:** 421347
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cobo
- **Contact Name:** Kenneth Lee
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they added several potentially malicious domain names to their denylist, but one of the domains, which is a 302 redirect, still allowed access to the blocked domain and retrieved the redirect link.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The specific feature in question was the Allowlist/Denylist functionality.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that the domain was added to the denylist.
2. The support team reviewed the denylist configuration and the behavior of the EPP client regarding blocked domains.
3. The support team conducted tests to verify if the EPP client was functioning as expected with the denylist.
4. Communication was maintained with the customer to provide updates and gather additional information.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a misunderstanding of how the EPP handles 302 redirects. The EPP client was functioning correctly by blocking access to the specified domain, but the redirect behavior allowed the client to access the redirect link.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the functionality of the EPP denylist to the customer. The support team explained that while the EPP client blocks access to the specified domain, it does not prevent access to redirect links that may lead to other domains. The customer was advised to monitor the behavior and apply any necessary policies/settings to enhance security.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that the EPP denylist may not block all redirect behaviors, especially with 302 redirects.
- Future cases involving denylist configurations should include a review of redirect behaviors to set appropriate expectations with customers.
