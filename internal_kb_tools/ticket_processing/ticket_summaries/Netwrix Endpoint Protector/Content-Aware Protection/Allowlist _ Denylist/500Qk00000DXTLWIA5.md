## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DXTLWIA5
- **Case Number:** 416088
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Brokertech
- **Contact Name:** Michael Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Domain Allowlist for Content-Aware Protection (CAP) was not functioning as expected. Despite adding specific URLs to the allowlist and updating the policy, file uploads to the specified domain were still being blocked.

## Environment Details
- The allowlist included the following URLs:
  - `.schemeswriter.co.uk`
  - `https://*.schemeswriter.co.uk`
  - `https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk`
- The issue was observed when attempting to upload files to `https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk/some/path`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that the allowlist was correctly configured in the Policy Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection section.
2. A remote session was proposed to further investigate the issue.
3. The customer provided diagnostics, logs, and example files that were blocked during upload attempts.
4. The customer switched debugging modes to gather logs, which led to the recreation of log files.
5. Communication was maintained to schedule a remote session for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. The customer indicated that the DPI allowlist did not work as expected, but further investigation was needed to determine the specific reason for the blocking behavior.

## Solution
The customer decided to close the ticket temporarily as the issue was not critical for their operations. They were advised to reopen the ticket if the problem persisted or if further assistance was needed.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the allowlist entries are correctly formatted and that the policy is applied to all relevant clients.
- Future investigations should include checking for any updates or changes in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector that may affect allowlist functionality.
- Customers should be encouraged to keep detailed logs and diagnostics when issues arise, as this information can be crucial for troubleshooting.
