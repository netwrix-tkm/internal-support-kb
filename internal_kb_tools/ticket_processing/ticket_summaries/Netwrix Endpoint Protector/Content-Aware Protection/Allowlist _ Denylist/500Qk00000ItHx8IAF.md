## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ItHx8IAF
- **Case Number:** 428420
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gamemano
- **Contact Name:** Nayan Rajore
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in blocking the incognito mode in the Chrome browser using the application deny list feature in content-aware policies. They reported that the Endpoint Protector (EPP) failed to prevent the Chrome incognito window from opening despite specifying the necessary parameters in the deny list.

## Environment Details
- The issue was tested in a controlled environment by the support team, which confirmed the problem's reproducibility.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer tested the scenario in a test environment and confirmed the issue.
2. Logs were collected, and a video recording was made to demonstrate the behavior.
3. The support team reviewed the parameters used in the deny list configuration.
4. Suggestions were made to use wildcard parameters to block incognito mode.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the inability of the application deny list to effectively block the Chrome executable when launched with specific parameters associated with incognito mode. The parameters used by Chrome in incognito mode were similar to those used in a normal launch, making it difficult to differentiate between the two.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the following configuration to the customer:
- **Application & CLI Command:** `chrome.exe`
- **Parameters:** `* --disable-databases *`

This configuration effectively blocked the incognito mode while allowing the regular Chrome application to function normally. The customer confirmed that the new values provided resolved their issue.

## Notes
- It is important to note that while the above solution works for Windows, similar configurations may need to be tested for macOS environments, as the parameters may behave differently.
- Future users should be aware that blocking incognito mode using the deny list may not be foolproof due to the nature of how Chrome launches its processes. Consideration for alternative methods or feature requests may be necessary for more robust solutions.
