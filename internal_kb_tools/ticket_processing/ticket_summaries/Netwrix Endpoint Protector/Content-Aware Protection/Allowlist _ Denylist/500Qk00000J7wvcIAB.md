## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J7wvcIAB
- **Case Number:** 428954
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Industrie- und Finanzkontor ETS
- **Contact Name:** Ilker Falk
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 14.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Industrie Und Finanzkontor (IUF), reported that their strict Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policies, which are designed to block all data transfers based on file type, were not consistently being enforced. Despite the policies, file transfers were occasionally successful for the five users in a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment.

## Environment Details
- The CAP policies were implemented for a limited number of users (5).
- The environment is a VDI setup.
- Debug logging was enabled for all users to capture detailed logs of the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted multiple calls with the customer to gather information and clarify the issue.
2. Enabled debug logging for all five users to capture detailed logs.
3. Tested various file types and transfer interfaces to replicate the issue.
4. Reviewed logs for any anomalies or patterns related to the successful file transfers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of improper configuration of the allowlist and denylist settings within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Specifically, the repeated addition of users and file types to the allowlist was not being saved correctly, leading to inconsistent enforcement of the CAP policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by systematically adding users and their respective file types to the allowlist and ensuring that changes were saved after each addition. This process was repeated until all necessary configurations were correctly applied, which restored the intended functionality of the CAP policies.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to the allowlist or denylist are saved after each modification to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and audit the CAP settings to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
- Consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism to capture configuration changes and their impacts on policy enforcement.
