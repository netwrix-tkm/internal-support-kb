## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M8FRtIAN
- **Case Number:** 436537
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 14.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Zoom application was not functioning when the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client was installed on their system.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the interaction between the Zoom application and the EPP client.
- The customer did not have the opportunity to test the resolution at home before the case was closed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the Zoom application fails to start when the EPP client is installed.
2. Engaged with Research and Development (R&D) for further investigation.
3. Monitored updates regarding the denylist enforcement status.
4. Noted that the issue was previously linked to the denylist enforcing restrictions on applications.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the denylist enforcement within the EPP client, which was blocking the Zoom application from starting. However, it was later determined that the denylist no longer enforced restrictions, allowing Zoom to function properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when it was confirmed that the denylist no longer enforced restrictions, which meant that nothing, including the Zoom application, was being blocked by the EPP client. The customer was advised to test the application at home after the changes were made.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the denylist settings in future cases, as changes in enforcement can directly impact application functionality.
- Customers should be encouraged to test applications in their home environment after any changes to the EPP client to ensure full functionality.
- Future support cases should consider the possibility of application conflicts with security software, particularly when denylist or allowlist features are involved.
