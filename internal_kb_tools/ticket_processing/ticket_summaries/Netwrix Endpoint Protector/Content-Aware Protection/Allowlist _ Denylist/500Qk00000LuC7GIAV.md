## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LuC7GIAV
- **Case Number:** 435959
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Trustly
- **Contact Name:** Rodrigo Monteiro
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in blocking a specific URL (`dropbox.com/login`) while allowing access to the general URL (`dropbox.com`). The existing product functionality only supported blocking at the domain level, not specific URL paths.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) version 5.9.4.0, later upgraded to 5.9.4.1.
- The issue involved API calls to `dropbox.com` that were being blocked by the policy settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to block `dropbox.com/login` by editing deny lists and allow lists in the EPP console.
2. Verified client communication with the EPP server using CLI commands to unload and load the EPP client daemon.
3. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client on a Macintosh system.
4. Created a new DPI inspection to allow `www.dropbox.com` and edited the policy to include the newly created allow list.
5. Conducted a remote session to verify the upgrade to EPP version 5.9.4.1 and check the functionality.
6. Engaged with the DevOps team to escalate the request for more granular URL blocking capabilities.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector product, which only supports blocking at the domain level (e.g., `www.dropbox.com`) and does not allow for blocking specific URL paths (e.g., `www.dropbox.com/login`).

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the current product functionality does not support the requested feature. The customer was advised to submit a feature request for the ability to block specific URL paths. The case was closed after the customer submitted the feature request.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that the current version of the product does not support blocking specific URL paths and that they can submit feature requests for future consideration.
- Ensure to follow up with customers regarding their feature requests and keep them informed about any updates or changes in product capabilities.
