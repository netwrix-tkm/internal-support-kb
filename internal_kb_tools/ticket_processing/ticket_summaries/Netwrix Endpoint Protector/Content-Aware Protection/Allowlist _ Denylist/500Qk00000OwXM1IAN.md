## Problem Description
The customer requested the implementation of a feature in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector tool that would allow users to block specific URLs and domains. This functionality was deemed essential for their operational needs.

- Ensure that customers are aware of the process for submitting feature requests to facilitate better communication and expectations regarding product enhancements.
