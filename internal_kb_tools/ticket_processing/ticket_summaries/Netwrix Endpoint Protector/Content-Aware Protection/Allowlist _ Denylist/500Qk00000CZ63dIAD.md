## Problem Description
The customer reported that policies in their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system were not applying correctly. Specifically, devices moved from a restrictive policy to an allowed list were still being blocked from performing tasks as per the allowed policy, which was impacting users' daily work.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed with new devices added to the same group where policies had previously worked without issues.
- No changes had been made to the policies prior to the issue arising.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to gather detailed information about the issue.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the problem further.
3. During the remote session, the Content Aware Policy was amended to address the issue.
4. Follow-up communication to confirm if the issue was resolved after the policy amendment.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it was indicated that the policies had previously worked for some users, suggesting a potential issue with how new devices were being recognized or processed by the DLP system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by amending the Content Aware Policy during a remote support session. The customer was asked to confirm if the changes resolved the issue with the print screen being blocked.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all devices are correctly recognized by the DLP system after policy changes.
- Future cases should consider checking for any updates or changes in the DLP system that might affect policy application.
- Regular communication with the customer is crucial to gather all necessary details for troubleshooting effectively.
