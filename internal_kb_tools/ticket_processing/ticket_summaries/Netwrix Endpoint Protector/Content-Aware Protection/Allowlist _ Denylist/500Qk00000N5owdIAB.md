- **Case Number:** 439294
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gamemano
- **Contact Name:** SANJAY KASHYAP
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where users were unable to upload image and video files (specifically mp4) to an AWS S3 bucket, despite having the necessary domains added to the allowlist.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The uploads were blocked due to a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the allowlist for the AWS S3 domain.
2. Identified that the AWS S3 domain was not correctly formatted in the DPI URL/domain allowed list.
3. Conducted a remote session with the customer to test the upload functionality after making changes.

## Root Cause
The uploads were blocked because the AWS S3 domain was not added correctly to the DPI URL/domain allowed list, which is necessary for the CAP policy to permit the transfer of specific file types.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correctly adding the Amazon AWS S3 domain to the DPI domain/URL allowed list. After this adjustment, the user tested the upload functionality and confirmed that it was working as expected.
