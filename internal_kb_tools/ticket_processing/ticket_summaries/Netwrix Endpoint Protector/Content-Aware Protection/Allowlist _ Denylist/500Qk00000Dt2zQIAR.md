## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Dt2zQIAR
- **Case Number:** 416871
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hub International Limited
- **Contact Name:** Ebenezer Brew
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 5941

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving tens of thousands of redundant and excessive logs from temporary Outlook AppData files in their content-aware reports. Attempts to add these files to the allowlist did not prevent them from appearing in the logs. Additionally, the customer observed duplicate logs without destination details, contributing to the excessive logging issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed across multiple terminal servers.
- The customer was using an older version of the Endpoint Protector client prior to the upgrade.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the allowlist settings and confirmed they were correctly configured.
2. Suggested the customer upgrade to the latest version of the Endpoint Protector client (version 5941).
3. Conducted a remote session to review the configuration and logs.
4. Monitored the situation over a period of weeks to assess the frequency of alerts.
5. Engaged R&D for further insights when the issue persisted after the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the excessive logging was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that the Outlook temporary files could not be opened by the Endpoint Protector at the first attempt due to concurrent access by Outlook, leading to a different flow in how these files were processed.

## Solution
The issue was addressed by:
- Adding the correct paths to the allowlist with a wildcard to ensure all relevant files were included.
- Upgrading the Endpoint Protector client to version 5941, which included improvements in logging and handling of allowlisted files.
- Continuous monitoring of the logs post-upgrade to ensure the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should ensure that the allowlist paths are correctly configured with wildcards as needed.
- It is advisable to keep the Endpoint Protector client updated to the latest version to benefit from improvements and fixes.
- If excessive logging persists after configuration changes, further investigation may be required, including generating detailed logs for analysis.
