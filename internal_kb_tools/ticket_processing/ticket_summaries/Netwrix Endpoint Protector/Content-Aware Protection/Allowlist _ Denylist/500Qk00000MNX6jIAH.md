- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MNX6jIAH
- **Case Number:** 437267
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arity
- **Contact Name:** James Ceart
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer was attempting to allowlist an email domain within a file (such as a text file) but was unsuccessful with the provided instructions.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue involved uploading a stack using a bat template on AWS, which resulted in a "failed to fetch" error.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue further.
2. Joined the remote session and confirmed the customer was trying to upload a stack using a bat template on AWS.
3. Identified two active policies that could potentially block the domain `transparent.ly`.
4. Instructed the customer to navigate to:
   - Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection
5. Advised the customer to add a new Deep Packet Inspection Allowlist for `transparent.ly` and save it.
6. Instructed the customer to add the newly created Allowlist to the Policy Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection.
7. Awaited feedback from the customer after testing the changes.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by existing policies in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector that were blocking the specified domain from being included in the file uploads.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Creating a separate policy for developers that excluded email addresses from being classified as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
2. Allowlisting specific websites used for uploading email addresses to prevent unnecessary blocks.
3. Optionally, implementing a complex regex pattern to identify email addresses while excluding certain domains.

The customer confirmed that these changes would prevent the blocking issue from occurring in the future.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that policies are reviewed regularly to avoid unintended blocks on necessary domains.
- Consider the complexity of regex patterns if opting for that solution, as it may require additional resources and effort for implementation.
- The customer was advised to exclude developers from the policy to prevent API calls from being blocked in the future.
