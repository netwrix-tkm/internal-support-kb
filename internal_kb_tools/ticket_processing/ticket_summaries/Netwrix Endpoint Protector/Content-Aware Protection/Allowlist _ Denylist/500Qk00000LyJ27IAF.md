## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LyJ27IAF
- **Case Number:** 436030
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Nayan Rajore
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2000

## Problem Description
The customer configured a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy to block uploads from all browsers except for specific SharePoint URLs and Google Drive. While the allowlist configuration worked for Gmail, it failed for Google Drive, preventing users from uploading files.

## Environment Details
- **Server:** 5941
- **Client Version:** 6.2.4.2000

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the CAP policy to ensure all browsers were included.
2. Added Google Drive URLs (`drive.google.com`, `doc.google.com`, `mail.google.com`) to the allowlist.
3. Linked the allowlist to the CAP policy.
4. Confirmed that the denylist was successfully blocking uploads except for certain SharePoint websites.
5. Scheduled a remote session to review the configuration with the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the allowlist settings for Google Drive, which prevented the policy from functioning as intended for that specific service.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Correctly configuring the allowlist to include the necessary Google Drive URLs.
- Ensuring that the allowlist was properly linked to the CAP policy.
- After making the adjustments, the customer tested the configuration, confirming that uploads to Google Drive were now permitted.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary URLs are included in the allowlist for services that require exceptions.
- Regularly review and test configurations after changes to confirm that policies are functioning as expected.
- Document any specific configurations or steps taken for future reference to assist in similar cases.
