## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on how to create a URL exception in a Content Aware Policy using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

The customer did not specify the version of the client, server, or operating system in use. The inquiry was related to the configuration of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for all devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry received regarding the ability to create a URL exception in a Content Aware Policy.

   - Save the Allowlist.
3. Instructed the customer on how to implement the Allowlist in the desired policy.
4. Followed up with the customer to ensure the steps were clear and to check for any further questions.
5. Addressed additional inquiries regarding the global configuration of DPI and its potential impacts on devices.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity on how to configure URL exceptions within the Content Aware Policy, as well as the implications of enabling DPI across all devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a step-by-step guide on how to create an Allowlist for a specific URL and how to apply it within the Content Aware Policy. Additionally, the customer was informed about the global configuration of DPI and its effects on device performance and compatibility.

## Notes
- When enabling DPI, be aware that it may require more CPU and memory resources, and could potentially introduce latency or compatibility issues with certain applications.
- It is advisable to consult the Netwrix Endpoint Protector User Manual for detailed information on DPI configuration and its implications.
- For future inquiries regarding DPI, ensure to gather information about the customer's environment, including the versions of the client and server, to provide more tailored support.
