- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where enabling a Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy prevented emails from being sent. The customer attempted to configure an allowlist to resolve this issue but was unsuccessful.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with the Content-Aware Protection module.
- The issue specifically involved email communications being blocked due to the CAP policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with documentation on configuring the email domain allowlist.
2. Conducted a remote session to assist the customer in collecting logs from the affected computer.
3. Analyzed the collected logs to identify any misconfigurations or issues.
4. Confirmed that an email address was not included in the E-mail Domain Allowlist, which caused the email to be blocked.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of the specific email address in the E-mail Domain Allowlist. As a result, emails were being blocked by the Endpoint Protector's CAP policy.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the necessary email domains to the Allowlist. The customer was guided on how to properly configure the allowlist to ensure that emails could be sent without being blocked by the CAP policy.

## Notes
- It is important for users to ensure that all necessary email addresses are included in the Allowlist to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If the problem recurs, the customer should be advised to check the Allowlist configuration and ensure that all relevant email domains are included.
- The customer was informed that they could reopen this ticket if the issue arises again or create a new ticket for further assistance.
