## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GZafJIAT
- **Case Number:** 422783
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CTBC Bank Corp. (Canada)
- **Contact Name:** Tony Hsieh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2 (Windows)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an email domain added to the allowlist was still being blocked by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- **System Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Version:** 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
- **Issue Frequency:** The issue did not occur consistently, making it difficult to reproduce.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Generated appended log files to capture the behavior of the system.
2. Proposed a remote session to generate logs with the new EPP client.
3. Instructed the customer to turn on the "Use Stealthy DPI Driver" setting for test computers.
4. Added one more email domain to the allowlist and removed and re-added it to the policy.
5. Followed up with the customer multiple times to check if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely due to a configuration error in the allowlist settings or a temporary glitch in the CAP feature that caused the domain to be incorrectly blocked despite being on the allowlist.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding an additional email domain to the allowlist. After this change, the customer confirmed that the blocking messages ceased, indicating that the emails were no longer being blocked.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the behavior after making changes to allowlist settings, as issues may not always reproduce immediately.
- Ensure that the "Use Stealthy DPI Driver" option is enabled for affected computers, as this may help mitigate similar issues in the future.
- Maintain clear communication with the customer to confirm resolution and gather feedback on the effectiveness of the solution.
