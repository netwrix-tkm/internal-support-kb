## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kx3j9IAB
- **Case Number:** 433235
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Morton Community Bank
- **Contact Name:** Joel Cox
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an internal email domain was not being bypassed by the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy, resulting in the blocking of a large Excel document being sent between employees, despite the domain being on the allowlist.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The internal email domains were expected to be bypassed according to the content-aware policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the settings on the EPP server; they appeared to be correct.
2. Collected logs after the initial troubleshooting steps recommended by R&D did not resolve the issue.
3. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to further investigate the issue and generate additional logs.
4. Confirmed that the Outlook add-in was enabled on the user's end.
5. Communicated with R&D for potential fixes and updates.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the inclusion of the "@" symbol in the email domain allowlist. The CAP policy did not recognize domains formatted with the "@" symbol, leading to the blocking of emails.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the "@" symbol from the email domain allowlist entries. The correct format for the allowlist should be the domain names without the "@" (e.g., `mortonbank.com` instead of `@mortonbank.com`).

## Notes
- Ensure that future configurations of email domain allowlists do not include the "@" symbol to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to document any changes made to policies and configurations for future reference.
