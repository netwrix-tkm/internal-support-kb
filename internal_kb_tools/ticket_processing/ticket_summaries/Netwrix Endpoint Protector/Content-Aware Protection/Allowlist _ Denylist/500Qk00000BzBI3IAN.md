## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to edit the allow list in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer reached out to the customer to gather more information about their availability for troubleshooting.
2. The customer confirmed their time zone and provided availability for further assistance.
3. The support engineer investigated the issue and identified that the editing problem was caused by interference from another program.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be caused by a conflict with another program running on the customer's system, which interfered with the functionality of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector interface.

## Solution
The resolution involved identifying the conflicting program and advising the customer to either disable it or adjust its settings to prevent it from interfering with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Once the conflict was resolved, the customer was able to successfully edit the allow list without the interface closing unexpectedly.

## Notes
- It is important for users to ensure that no other applications are running that may interfere with the functionality of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, especially when making changes to policies.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should be advised to check for any background applications that may cause conflicts and to temporarily disable them during the editing process.
