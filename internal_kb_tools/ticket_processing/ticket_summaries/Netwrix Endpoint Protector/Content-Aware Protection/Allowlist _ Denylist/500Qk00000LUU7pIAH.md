- **Case Number:** 434677
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RapidOps Solutions Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Prashant Deshbhartar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested to restrict Git pull and push operations to a specific URL (`gitrepo.rapidops.com`) only, blocking all other URLs for these operations.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection features.
- The customer had not configured the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) settings properly, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) was not enabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered initial requirements from the customer regarding the restriction of Git operations.
2. Provided instructions on how to configure the CAP policy to allow only the specified URL.
3. Followed up with the customer after initial instructions were provided.
4. Conducted a remote session to adjust the CAP policy and enable DPI.
5. Advised the customer to uninstall and reinstall the latest EPP client for Ubuntu 20.
6. Confirmed with the customer that the solution was working as intended.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to improper configuration of the CAP settings and the DPI not being enabled, which prevented the desired restrictions on Git operations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correctly configuring the CAP settings to allow only the specified Git URL.
- Enabling DPI to ensure that the restrictions were enforced effectively.
- Guiding the customer to reinstall the EPP client to ensure compatibility and functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure that CAP settings are properly configured and DPI is enabled for similar requests in the future.
- It is advisable to follow up with the customer after implementing changes to confirm that the solution is functioning as expected.
