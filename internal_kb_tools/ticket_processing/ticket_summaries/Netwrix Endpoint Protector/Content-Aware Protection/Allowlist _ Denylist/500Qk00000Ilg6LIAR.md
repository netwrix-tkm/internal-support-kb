## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ilg6LIAR
- **Case Number:** 428057
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bemobi
- **Contact Name:** Guillermo Vidal
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 5941

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the DPI Allowlist dictionary where the list of sites created for exclusion was not being retained in the CAP policy. After applying the list and checking again, it appeared empty.

## Environment Details
- The customer was experiencing server issues, including intermittent downtime and CPU spikes, attributed to having only one CPU allocated.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified the issue as a bug in version 5940 of the server.
2. Provided a temporary workaround: re-check all desired "Allowed Files" and/or "Deep Packet Inspection" components before clicking the SAVE option.
3. Informed the DevOps team about the server issues and CPU spikes.
4. Coordinated with the sales and product teams to add an extra CPU to the server instance.
5. Conducted a remote session with the customer to review their configuration.
6. Monitored server performance after adding the extra CPU and applying optimization procedures.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a bug in server version 5940, which prevented the Allowlist from being saved correctly in the CAP policy.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by upgrading the server to version 5941, which fixed the Allowlist issue. Additionally, the server's performance improved after adding an extra CPU and optimizing the configuration.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers experiencing similar issues are informed about the workaround while awaiting a server update.
- Monitor server performance closely after making hardware changes to prevent future downtime.
- Advise customers to check their configurations regularly, especially if they are not using shadows or alerts, as this can impact policy effectiveness.
