## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GdR0jIAF
- **Case Number:** 422958
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kepsure Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Dharmik Bhayani
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested to block all attachments except for those from `outlook.office.com`, and to restrict web WhatsApp to only allow video files as attachments.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's requirements for attachment restrictions.
2. Attempted to configure the allowlist and denylist settings for attachments.
3. Enabled Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to monitor and control attachment types.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the initial configuration settings that did not properly enforce the attachment restrictions as specified by the customer.

## Solution
Enabling Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) allowed the system to effectively monitor and control the types of attachments being sent and received. This configuration successfully allowed attachments from `outlook.office.com` while blocking all others, and restricted web WhatsApp to only video file attachments.

## Notes
- Ensure that DPI is enabled for similar configurations to effectively manage attachment permissions.
- Future requests for attachment restrictions should clearly specify the domains and file types to avoid misconfigurations.
