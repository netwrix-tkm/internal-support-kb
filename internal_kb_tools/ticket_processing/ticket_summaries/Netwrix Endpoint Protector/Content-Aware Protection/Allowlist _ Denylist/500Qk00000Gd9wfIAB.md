- **Case Number:** 422939
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** 1Rivet
- **Contact Name:** Subetharan Muthuswami
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a policy was created to prevent the uploading of any documents to a cloud platform, but they were still able to upload documents to Google Drive.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Policy Type:** Content-Aware Protection

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the policy settings to ensure they were correctly configured to block uploads to cloud services.
2. Checked the logs for any indications of policy enforcement or violations.
3. Tested the policy on different cloud platforms to confirm the issue was specific to Google Drive.
4. Reviewed the documentation for any known issues or limitations regarding the Allowlist/Denylist feature.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the policy settings, which did not effectively apply to Google Drive due to its specific handling of uploads.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the policy settings to ensure that the restrictions applied correctly to Google Drive. This involved:
- Updating the Denylist to explicitly include Google Drive as a prohibited upload destination.
- Ensuring that the policy was properly enforced across all relevant endpoints.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review and test policy configurations to ensure they are effectively blocking or allowing the intended actions.
- Consider documenting any specific cloud services that require unique handling in policy settings to avoid similar issues in the future.
