- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in blocking specific applications, such as AnyDesk and WhatsApp, to prevent users from accessing them.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Content-Aware Protection features.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was guided to create a Denylist entry for the applications they wanted to block.
2. Instructions were provided to create a new policy for blocking YouTube for individual users.
3. The customer confirmed that the initial instructions helped block WhatsApp in web browsers but not the desktop application.
4. Further guidance was given to add the WhatsApp desktop application to the Denylist through the EPP UI.
5. A remote session was scheduled to assist with any remaining issues.

## Root Cause
The initial configuration successfully blocked web access to WhatsApp but did not account for the desktop application, which requires a separate entry in the Denylist.

## Solution
1. The customer was instructed to navigate to the Denylist & Allowlist menu in the EPP UI.
2. They created a new entry under the Application submenu specifically for the WhatsApp desktop application.
3. The denylist was assigned to a policy, saved, and applied to the user machines.
4. The customer confirmed that the WhatsApp desktop application was successfully blocked after following these steps.

## Notes
- Ensure that both web and desktop versions of applications are considered when implementing blocking policies.
- For future cases, remind customers to check for installed applications separately from web-based access when configuring denylists.
