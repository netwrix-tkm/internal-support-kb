## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Lnv1AIAR
- **Case Number:** 435639
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (latest tested)

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with a deny-list implemented through the Content Aware Policy. While the deny-list functioned correctly without a VPN, connecting to the work VPN caused ERR_Failing messages and blocked access to various websites, including essential applications like Zoom.

## Environment Details
- Affected Device: Mac computers
- VPN Configuration: Set to not block content
- EPP Configuration: Content Aware Policy enabled with a deny-list

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Enabled DPI Smart Logging on the customer's Mac during a remote session.
2. Observed that enabling logging temporarily resolved some issues, but after a reboot, all websites and the Zoom app were blocked.
3. Provided steps for the customer to collect EPP client logs:
   - Unload the EPP client daemon.
   - Create log files.
   - Reproduce the issue.
   - Copy log files to the Desktop for analysis.
4. Opened an R&D ticket (00436075) to investigate the collected logs.
5. Suggested testing with the latest EPP client version (5.9.4.1) and collecting extended DPI logs if issues persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a conflict between the Content Aware Policy and the VPN connection, which caused the deny-list to block access to websites even after the policy had been received. It was noted that if the user was not connected to the VPN that connects to the EPP server, the deny-list would stop applying intermittently.

## Solution
The customer reported that the issue was resolved after reconnecting to the VPN. It was confirmed that the deny-list functioned correctly once the connection was re-established. The customer was advised to ensure that the VPN connection is active to maintain the application of the deny-list.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are connected to the VPN that links to the EPP server for the deny-list to remain effective.
- If issues arise again, collecting extended DPI logs and testing with the latest EPP client version should be prioritized.
- Future deployments should consider the impact of VPN configurations on EPP policies to avoid similar issues.
