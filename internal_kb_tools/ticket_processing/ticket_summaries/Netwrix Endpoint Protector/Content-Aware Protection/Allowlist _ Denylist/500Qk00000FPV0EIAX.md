## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FPV0EIAX
- **Case Number:** 420257
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Landkreis LÃ¼chow-Dannenberg
- **Contact Name:** Jannick Teichmann
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with a CAP (Content Aware Protection) policy that was preventing a specific .exe file on a USB dongle from being executed, despite the file being added to the File-Allowlist. The customer expected that the allowlist would exempt this file from the restrictions imposed by the CAP policy, which generally prohibits .exe files.

## Environment Details
- The CAP policy was configured to allow only .jpg and .png files on USB storage devices.
- The .exe file in question was necessary for connecting a device to a presentation solution.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the CAP policy and the File-Allowlist.
2. Checked the hash value of the .exe file to ensure it matched the entry in the allowlist.
3. Attempted to execute the .exe file while monitoring the Content Aware Report for any entries related to the execution attempt.
4. Reviewed the policy documentation regarding the behavior of allowlists in conjunction with deny policies.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a misunderstanding of how the allowlist interacts with the CAP policy. Although the allowlist was correctly configured, the CAP policy was still enforcing restrictions on .exe files, leading to the execution failure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the specific .exe file was correctly selected and recognized in the allowlist. Once this was confirmed, the file was successfully executed without being blocked by the CAP policy.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the file in the allowlist is correctly identified and selected to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be aware that allowlists may not override deny policies if not configured properly.
- Consider providing guidance on how to manage file signatures for future cases where specific files need to be allowed based on their digital signatures.
