- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that WhatsApp uploads were being blocked for many users, despite no policies being applied to restrict this functionality. The issue was resolved temporarily by uninstalling the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP).

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- Another tool, Netskope One Client (a SASE client), was also installed on the affected machines.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that no policies were blocking WhatsApp uploads.
2. Uninstalled the EPP, which allowed WhatsApp uploads to function correctly.
3. Investigated the presence of other security tools that might interfere with EPP.
4. Identified that Netskope One Client was installed and potentially causing conflicts.
5. Disabled the Netskope One Client to test if EPP would function as expected.
6. Conducted multiple remote sessions with the customer to gather logs and further diagnose the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the interference of the Netskope One Client with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The presence of this additional security tool was blocking WhatsApp uploads, despite no policies being applied within EPP.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the Netskope One Client. Once this tool was disabled, the EPP resumed normal functionality, allowing WhatsApp uploads to work as intended. The case was subsequently closed as resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of potential conflicts with other security tools when using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- Recommend checking for other installed security applications if similar issues arise in the future.
- Document any additional policies that may be applied to the client machines to avoid confusion during troubleshooting.
