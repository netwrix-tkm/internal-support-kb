- **Case Number:** 426746
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Sudipa Bera
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy was incorrectly flagging internal emails as external, despite the relevant domains being added to the allowlist. The issue persisted even after confirming that "Deep Packet Inspection" was enabled.

## Environment Details
- The issue affected multiple users within the organization.
- The domains were added to the "E-mail Domain" allowlist, and "Deep Packet Inspection" was confirmed to be enabled in both global and group settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the domains were added to the correct allowlist.
2. Verified that "Deep Packet Inspection" was enabled under "Device Control" > "Global Settings."
3. Conducted a remote session to test the scenario on the customer's machine.
4. Collected diagnostic logs from the affected user's machine.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was noted that the Endpoint Protector was functioning as expected during the remote session, indicating that the issue may have been intermittent or related to specific user configurations.

## Solution
- The customer was advised to manually collect logs from the affected user's machine using the Support Tool and upload them to the Netwrix support portal for further analysis.
- It was recommended that the customer upgrade the Endpoint Protector clients to the latest version (5.9.4.0) to ensure compatibility and optimal performance, as there was a version mismatch with the server.

## Notes
- The customer should monitor the situation and report any recurrence of the issue.
- Ensure that all users are using the same version of the Endpoint Protector client as the server to avoid potential discrepancies in functionality.
