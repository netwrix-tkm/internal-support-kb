## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O6aKkIAJ
- **Case Number:** 442218
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SmartNet VN
- **Contact Name:** Phuong Nguyen
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Allowlist / Denylist
- **Version:** EPP server 5.9.4.1 and EPP client 6.2.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with configuring email domain allow and deny lists. They successfully created a deny list to block emails to the Gmail domain but encountered problems when trying to allow specific users to send emails to Gmail addresses, which were still being blocked despite being added to the allow list.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **EPP Client Version:** 6.2.4.2
- **Testing Platforms:** Outlook application (new UI) and Gmail web browser (Chrome and Edge with DPI module enabled).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the deny list was functioning correctly by testing email sending to the Gmail domain.
2. Verified that the allow list was configured correctly for specific users.
3. Inquired about the testing environment and whether the DPI module was enabled in the browsers.
4. Scheduled a remote session to assist the customer with the configuration.
5. Followed up with the customer multiple times to check availability for the remote session.
6. Conducted internal tests to replicate the issue, which were successful in allowing emails to be sent to Gmail addresses when configured correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy, specifically related to the interaction between the deny list and the allow list. The deny list was blocking emails to the Gmail domain, which inadvertently affected the allow list settings.

## Solution
The customer was guided to review and correct the misconfigurations in their CAP policy. After making the necessary adjustments to the allow list and ensuring it was correctly set up to override the deny list for specific users, the issue was resolved, and emails could be sent to the specified Gmail addresses.

## Notes
- Ensure that when configuring allow and deny lists, the interactions between them are clearly understood to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to test configurations in a controlled environment before deploying them widely.
- Future users should be reminded to check for any overlapping rules in their policies that may cause conflicts.
