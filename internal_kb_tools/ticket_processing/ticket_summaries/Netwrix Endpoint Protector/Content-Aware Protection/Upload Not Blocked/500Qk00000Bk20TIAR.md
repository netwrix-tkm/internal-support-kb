- **Case Number:** 411698
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Bhavishya Arya
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** Server: 5.9.3.0, EPP Client: 6.2.2.1006

## Problem Description
The customer reported that JPEG images were not being blocked according to the OCR policy during uploads on Microsoft Teams, despite the implementation of a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **EPP Client Version:** 6.2.2.1006
- **Exit Point:** Microsoft Teams

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server and client versions with the customer.
2. Attempted to reproduce the issue using the provided test JPEG image.
3. Conducted a remote session to further investigate the blocking functionality.
4. Tested various images for OCR blocking, which was successful for some but not for the JPEG in question.
5. Reviewed settings related to Text Inspection and DPI for the MS Teams exit point.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was due to misconfiguration of the Data Loss Prevention settings, specifically related to the Text Inspection and DPI settings for the Microsoft Teams exit point. 

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that:
- Text Inspection was enabled under Content-Aware Protection (CAP) > DPI.
- DPI was enabled for the Microsoft Teams exit point.

After these settings were correctly configured, the custom content was successfully blocked in Microsoft Teams during testing.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Text Inspection and DPI settings are verified for all exit points when configuring DLP policies.
- Future cases involving similar issues should start with a review of these settings to prevent delays in resolution.
