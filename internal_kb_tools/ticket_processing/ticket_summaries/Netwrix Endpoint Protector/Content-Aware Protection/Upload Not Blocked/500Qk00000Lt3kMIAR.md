## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Lt3kMIAR
- **Case Number:** 435873
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Rubyplay Limited
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** 14.02

## Problem Description
The customer, RubyPlay, reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was not blocking URLs from Lightshot when sent via Slack. Despite adding the relevant URLs to the Denylist, the URLs were still transmitted successfully in Slack messages.

## Environment Details
- The issue was reproducible in the support team's environment.
- The URLs added to the Denylist included:
  - `//prnt.sc/`
  - `https://prnt.sc/`
  - `prnt.sc`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the URLs were correctly added to the Denylist.
2. Tested the blocking functionality with URLs sent to a different site (DLPTest.com), which worked as expected.
3. Reproduced the issue internally to confirm the behavior.
4. Collected logs and screenshots for further analysis.
5. Escalated the issue to the R&D team for deeper investigation.
6. Provided a test build to the customer for validation.
7. Gathered feedback from the customer regarding the test build.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a bug in how Slack classifies URLs. The EPP was not detecting sensitive content because Slack was treating URLs differently based on their formatting (with or without the http/https prefix). The issue was fixed by modifying the detection logic to search for the "url" tag when the "text" tag was missing.

## Solution
A test build was provided to the customer, which successfully blocked the URLs sent to Slack. However, it was noted that the last connection was shown as "Unknown," and no notification pop-up appeared after the block. The R&D team confirmed that the bug would be fixed in the next client release (version 5943).

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation after the release of version 5943.
- It is important to ensure that the Denylist is correctly configured and that the latest client version is being used to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Any future test builds should be validated thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected before deployment.
