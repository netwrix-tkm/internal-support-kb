## Problem Description
The client reported that some uploads were not being blocked by the Content-Aware Protection feature. Upon investigation, it was found that logging for this feature had stopped on October 31, and there was an alert indicating license expiry.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

2. Confirmed that logging had ceased on October 31.
3. Noted the alert regarding license expiry.
4. Communicated with the client to gather additional information and urgency regarding the license renewal.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an expired license for the Content-Aware Protection feature, which resulted in the feature ceasing to function properly.

## Solution
The solution involved the following steps:
1. Provided the client with an extension key for the license.
2. Instructed the client to log into the Endpoint Protector web interface and navigate to:
   - System Configuration > System Licensing > Import Licenses
3. Advised the client to upload the license file in .txt format.
4. Confirmed with the client that the license extension was successfully applied, and the upload blocking feature was functioning as intended.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor license expiry dates to prevent similar issues in the future.
