## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MGRZ5IAP
- **Case Number:** 436848
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AutoFi
- **Contact Name:** Jayme Villafranca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature was not detecting uploads of test spreadsheets containing fake Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to the specified website. This functionality had previously worked without issues, and no recent changes were made to the CAP policies.

## Environment Details
- The issue was reproducible only on one specific Mac device, while other devices operated correctly.
- The customer was using a specific Secure Web Gateway (SWG) which was suspected to be related to the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the CAP policies were correctly configured on the affected Mac.
2. Attempted to upload test spreadsheets multiple times without success.
3. Conducted a clean reinstall of the Endpoint Protector software on the affected device.
4. Checked the Endpoint Protector proxy settings, which were found to be disabled despite correct configurations.
5. Gathered logs from both the affected and a functioning test machine for comparison.
6. Investigated the impact of the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) settings, specifically the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the DPI feature, which appeared to have malfunctioned following the server upgrade to version 5.9.4.1. Disabling DPI allowed uploads to be detected correctly, indicating that DPI was interfering with the CAP functionality.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by editing the bypass rule in the Endpoint Protector settings. Instead of specifying the program “com.cososys.eppclient” as the source, they changed it to “Any.” This adjustment allowed the CAP to function correctly again after the upgrade.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the stability of this solution over time, as the change made may have unforeseen impacts.
- Future updates or changes to the Endpoint Protector software should be tested in a controlled environment to prevent similar issues from arising.
- The customer also reported issues with email notifications, which may require further investigation by the development team.
