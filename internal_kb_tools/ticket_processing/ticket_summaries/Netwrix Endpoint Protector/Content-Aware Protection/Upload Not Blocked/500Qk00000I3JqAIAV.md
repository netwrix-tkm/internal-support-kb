- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to block certain resources using a simple regex in the denylist. While the denylist worked for some resources, it failed to block access to specific sites such as translate.google.com, openai.co, and deepl.com.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector for content-aware protection.
- The regex was tested successfully on dlptest.com, indicating that the denylist functionality was operational for some cases.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that the regex worked for some resources but not for others.
2. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
3. The customer provided additional problematic URLs, including:
   - https://copilot.microsoft.com/
   - https://gemini.google.com/app
4. The customer attempted to download artifact logs but reported that nothing happened when trying to do so.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the text inspection capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. It was confirmed that text inspection in text forms is available only for a limited number of destinations (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, and dlptest). The specific sites mentioned by the customer were not supported for text inspection.

## Solution
The support team informed the customer about the limitations of the product regarding text inspection for certain sites. The case was closed after confirming that the functionality was working as intended for supported sites, and the customer was advised accordingly.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers about the limitations of text inspection capabilities in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, especially regarding unsupported sites.
- Customers should be encouraged to test their denylist configurations on supported sites to ensure functionality.
- If customers encounter issues with downloading logs or other functionalities, they should be guided to use the Support Tool for log collection and troubleshooting.
