- **Case Number:** 422041
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Praella
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** MacOS 15

## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) during a proof of concept (POC):
1. File uploads were not blocked on webmail services, specifically Gsuite, while uploads were blocked on other URLs.
2. CAP reports were initially generated, but shadow copies were not appearing.
3. General CAP reports ceased to be generated after some time.

Additionally, the customer inquired about the availability of the EPP agent for MacOS 15 and requested clarification on email domain restrictions for Gsuite.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** MacOS 15
- **Webmail Service:** Gsuite

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a session with the customer to understand the issues in detail.
2. Verified the file upload behavior on Gsuite and other URLs.
3. Checked the settings related to CAP report generation and shadow copies.
4. Enabled the File Hash option in the Global settings to see if it affected shadow copy generation.

## Root Cause
The initial issue with file uploads not being blocked on Gsuite was due to configuration settings within the EPP. The absence of shadow copies was linked to the File Hash option not being enabled in the Global settings.

## Solution
1. Adjusted the configuration to ensure that file uploads were blocked on the Gmail web interface.
2. Enabled the File Hash option in the Global settings, which allowed shadow files to be generated and downloaded successfully.
3. Confirmed that the issue with general CAP reports not being generated was resolved after the above changes.

The customerâ€™s queries regarding the MacOS 15 agent and email domain restrictions were addressed, and they confirmed that the provided information was satisfactory.

## Notes
- Ensure that the File Hash option is enabled in Global settings for proper shadow copy generation.
- For future cases involving webmail services, verify the specific configurations related to file uploads and blocking rules.
- Confirm compatibility of agent files with the customer's operating system version before proceeding with installations.
