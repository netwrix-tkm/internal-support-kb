## Problem Description

## Environment Details

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** The support engineer asked the customer which browser was being used and if the issue persisted across different browsers.
2. **CAP Policy Verification:** The support engineer confirmed whether the browser in use was included in the CAP policy settings.
3. **Remote Session Proposal:** A remote session was proposed to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was confirmed that the CAP policy was correctly configured and functional, as the customer later reported that the policy worked.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after confirming the correct configuration of the CAP policy. The customer confirmed that the policy worked as intended after the troubleshooting steps were completed.

## Notes
- Ensure that the CAP policy settings are correctly configured for all browsers intended for use with web Outlook.
- Future cases should verify browser compatibility and settings within the CAP policy to prevent similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to conduct a remote session proactively if initial troubleshooting does not yield results.
