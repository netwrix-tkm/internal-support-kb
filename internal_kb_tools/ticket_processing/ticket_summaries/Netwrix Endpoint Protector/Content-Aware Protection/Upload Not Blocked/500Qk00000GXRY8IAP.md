## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GXRY8IAP
- **Case Number:** 422679
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Avrioc Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Naveen Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** 6.2.4.0031

## Problem Description
The customer reported that file uploads were not being blocked in the Microsoft Teams application, despite having configured a policy to restrict uploads across applications. The uploads were successfully blocked when using the Teams web application, indicating a discrepancy in the enforcement of the policy.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Microsoft Teams desktop application.
- The customer was using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector for content-aware protection.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy settings.
2. Ensured that Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) was enabled for the Microsoft Teams application.
3. Conducted tests with different configurations of DPI settings (enabled/disabled) and rights functionality (User vs. Computer).
4. Uninstalled the existing EPP client version (6.2.3.1) and installed test builds (6.2.3.0064 and 6.2.3.0070) to evaluate if the issue persisted.
5. Engaged in multiple remote sessions with the customer to review settings and test scenarios.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to a mismatch in the configuration of the rights functionality and DPI settings. The DPI was set to "OFF" at the computer level while the CAP policy was enforced at the user level, leading to ineffective blocking of uploads in the Teams application.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after upgrading to the test build version 6.2.4.0031. This version successfully enforced the upload restrictions in Microsoft Teams, blocking file uploads as intended. The customer confirmed that the policy was now functioning correctly.

## Notes
- The customer expressed the need for occasional uploads to services like VirusTotal for reputation checks. It is important to consider this requirement when configuring policies.
- Future configurations should ensure that DPI settings are consistently applied across both user and computer levels to avoid similar issues.
