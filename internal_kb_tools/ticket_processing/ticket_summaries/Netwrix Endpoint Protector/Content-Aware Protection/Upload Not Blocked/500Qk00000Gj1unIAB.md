- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Gj1unIAB
- **Case Number:** 423093
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP agent installed on MacOS was not blocking file uploads through browsers, despite having configured the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy for this purpose. The same configuration was working correctly on Windows and Linux machines.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** MacOS
- **EPP Agent:** Installed and configured with necessary settings for CAP policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the EPP agent on MacOS.
2. Confirmed that all required settings for the EPP client were enabled.
3. Checked the configuration of the CAP policy for file upload blocking.
4. Compared settings and behavior with Windows and Linux machines where the policy was functioning correctly.
5. Collected extended logs from the EPP agent for further analysis.
6. Inquired about the use of any VPNs, proxies, or third-party applications that might interfere with the EPP client.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the presence of multiple VPNs or proxies, which interfered with the EPP clientâ€™s ability to enforce the CAP policy for blocking file uploads. Additionally, other third-party applications that intercept traffic could also contribute to this behavior.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the EPP agent was the primary application handling traffic without interference from other VPNs, proxies, or third-party applications. The customer was advised to review their network configuration to eliminate conflicts that could prevent the EPP client from functioning as intended.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that no other applications or network configurations interfere with the EPP client, especially when using multiple VPNs or proxies.
- Future cases should include a thorough check of the network environment to identify potential conflicts that could affect the EPP functionality.
