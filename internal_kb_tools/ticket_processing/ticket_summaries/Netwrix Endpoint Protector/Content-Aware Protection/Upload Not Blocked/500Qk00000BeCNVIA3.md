## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BeCNVIA3
- **Case Number:** 411467
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the configured Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy for blocking CAD and PDF file attachments was not functioning as expected. While the policy successfully blocked these file types on web URLs, it failed to block them when attached to email clients.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on Windows users within the organization.
- The CAP policy was intended to prevent the attachment of files containing drawing data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the CAP policy to ensure it was set up correctly.
2. Conducted a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. Verified the behavior of the CAP policy during the remote session.
4. Enabled an additional CAP policy with a "Report Only" action to monitor other file types being sent.

## Root Cause
The CAP policy was functioning correctly; however, it was not set to block the attachment of files in email clients. Instead, it was configured to block based on file extensions, which allowed the attachments to be added but prevented them from being sent.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the CAP policy was correctly configured and operational. An additional CAP policy was enabled with a "Report Only" action to monitor all other files sent via email. This allowed the customer to track file transfers without blocking them outright.

## Notes
- Ensure that CAP policies are thoroughly tested in all intended environments (e.g., web and email clients) to confirm their effectiveness.
- Consider providing training or documentation to users on how to properly configure and test CAP policies to avoid similar issues in the future.
