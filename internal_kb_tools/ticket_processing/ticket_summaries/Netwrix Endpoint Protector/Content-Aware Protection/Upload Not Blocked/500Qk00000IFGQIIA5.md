## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IFGQIIA5
- **Case Number:** 426875
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** J. Vilaseca S.A.
- **Contact Name:** Roger Escura
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** LXR0R8DQ

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a "Content-Aware" policy was configured to block file transfers to Microsoft Teams, but files could still be uploaded to OneDrive via the Microsoft Teams desktop application.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** LXR0R8DQ
- The issue was specifically observed when attempting to upload files from Microsoft Teams to OneDrive.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested additional details regarding the issue, including whether the OneDrive application was selected as an exit point in the Content-Aware Policy.
2. The engineer suggested collecting logs during the occurrence of the issue and proposed a remote session for further investigation.
3. The customer confirmed that the upload was blocked correctly when files were sent to a private chat in Teams but not when uploading to OneDrive.
4. The support team acknowledged the situation and informed the customer of an upcoming fix in the next update.
5. A workaround was provided: apply the allowlist twice in the Content-Aware Policy.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the Content-Aware Protection policy where the OneDrive application was not correctly recognized as an exit point for file transfers, allowing uploads to bypass the intended restrictions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the allowlist for the files twice in the Content-Aware Policy. This workaround effectively allowed the policy to recognize the files as permitted, thus blocking the uploads as intended.

## Notes
- A fix for this issue is scheduled for release in the next update of the Endpoint Protector.
- It is important to ensure that the OneDrive application is explicitly included in the Content-Aware Policy to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to apply the allowlist twice as a temporary workaround until the official fix is implemented.
