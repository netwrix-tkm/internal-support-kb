## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JXzJZIA1
- **Case Number:** 429950
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Geislinger GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Panagiotis Dragatis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Upload Not Blocked
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Server), 6.2.4.1006 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically regarding its compatibility with Microsoft Teams. Users experienced inconsistent behavior where file uploads to Teams were sometimes blocked and sometimes allowed, despite policies intended to prevent such uploads. Additionally, there were instances where blocked uploads were reported, but the files were still successfully uploaded without any logging.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Versions:** 6.2.4.1006 and 6.2.3.1010
- **Exit Point:** Microsoft Teams

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer set up a CAP policy to block all file types to all exit points.
2. Tests were conducted to upload files to various platforms:
   - Uploading to WeTransfer was successfully blocked.
   - Uploading to Microsoft Teams resulted in files being uploaded despite the policy.
3. The customer captured logs during the tests, noting discrepancies in logging for uploads to Teams.
4. The support team attempted to reproduce the issue in their environment, confirming the inconsistent behavior.
5. The support team verified that the Teams application was restarted after policy changes were made.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect related to the interaction between the Endpoint Protector's CAP policies and Microsoft Teams. It was determined that certain paths or processes associated with Teams were not being monitored correctly, leading to inconsistent enforcement of the CAP policies.

## Solution
The development team confirmed that a fix would be included in the upcoming release of version 5.9.4.3. The customer was informed of this resolution, and upon confirmation that the issue was reproducible, the ticket was closed.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the Teams application is restarted after any changes to CAP policies to ensure proper enforcement.
- Users should be aware that similar issues may arise with other applications if they are not monitored correctly by the Endpoint Protector.
- The fix for this issue is scheduled for release in version 5.9.4.3, targeted for the second half of May 2025.
