- **Case Number:** 428792
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International
- **Contact Name:** Csilla Torok
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to trigger the predefined content for UK bank accounts using various formats. They sought assistance to understand what they were doing wrong, as they had previously been provided with formats that should work.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically related to the Content-Aware Protection feature for predefined content.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to trigger the UK bank account predefined content using multiple formats:
   - `8D + 6D` (e.g., `12345678 123456`)
   - `8D + 6D with space` (e.g., `12345678 12 34 56`)
   - `8D + 6D with dash` (e.g., `12345678 12-34-56`)
   - `8D` (e.g., `12345678`)
   - `6D` (e.g., `123456`, `12 34 56`, `12-34-56`)
2. Support provided the correct format for UK bank accounts:
   - `6D + 8D` (e.g., `123456 12345678`)
   - `6D with space + 8D` (e.g., `12 34 56 12345678`)
   - `6D with dash + 8D` (e.g., `12-34-56 12345678`)
3. The customer was advised to test with real data to ensure the EPP Client was functioning correctly.
4. Logs were collected and analyzed to identify any discrepancies.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be related to the formats used for testing. The customer was using the wrong order for the sort code and account number. The correct order is to have the sort code (6 digits) first, followed by the account number (8 digits). Additionally, the samples provided by the customer did not respect the checksum rules required for valid UK bank accounts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the correct format for UK bank accounts and providing valid sample data that adhered to the checksum rules. The following valid samples were provided for testing:
- `871427 99123496`
- `309070 12345668`
- `180002 00000190`
- `66 75 80 19709652`
- `99 36 75 36867541`

The customer was instructed to use these samples for testing, which successfully triggered the predefined content.

## Notes
- Ensure that the sort code is always placed before the account number when testing UK bank account formats.
- Validate that the samples used for testing adhere to the checksum rules for UK bank accounts to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Encourage customers to test with real data whenever possible, as the detection algorithm is designed to minimize false positives.
