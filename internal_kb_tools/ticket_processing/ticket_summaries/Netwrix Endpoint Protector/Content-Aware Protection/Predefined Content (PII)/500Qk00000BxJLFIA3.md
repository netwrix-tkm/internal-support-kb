## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BxJLFIA3
- **Case Number:** 412147
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wrapbook
- **Contact Name:** Colin O'Shea
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
Michael, a reports admin in the EPP instance, reported discrepancies between the reports generated and the actual files containing confidential information downloaded to end users' machines. The reports indicated over 100 more reports than what EPP detected.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Modules Involved:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP) and eDiscovery

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to gather more context.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the discrepancies further.
3. Discussed potential configurations that might have been overlooked.
4. Explored the possibility of testing uploads/file copies to identify false positives.
5. Conducted a remote session where various topics were discussed, including:
   - Targeting specific file names for local scanning.
   - Blocking/reporting uploads of files matching a regex expression.
   - SIEM and Audit Log Backup functionality.
   - Upgrading the EPP server and client.

## Root Cause
The discrepancies were likely due to misconfigurations in the EPP settings that affected the detection of PII in the reports. Specific configurations regarding file scanning and reporting were not properly set, leading to the detection issues.

## Solution
During the remote session, the following actions were taken:
- Reviewed and adjusted the configurations related to Content-Aware Protection and eDiscovery.
- Ensured that the system was set to properly scan and report files containing predefined PII.
- Provided guidance on how to target specific file names and manage uploads effectively.

The issue was resolved after confirming that the configurations were correctly set and functioning as intended.

## Notes
- Ensure that all configurations related to PII detection are reviewed periodically to avoid similar discrepancies in the future.
- It is recommended to conduct regular training sessions for admins on how to utilize the reporting features effectively.
- If similar issues arise, consider scheduling a remote session to investigate the configurations in detail.
