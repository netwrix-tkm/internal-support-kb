# Support Case Summary

## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EP1dbIAD
- **Case Number:** 418029
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Shakta Technologies Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Lokesh N
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues related to Intune and data protection configurations, specifically:
1. Deployment of Client CA certificates to Macs using Intune.
2. A policy intended to block only PII data was incorrectly detecting non-PII data.
3. Inquiry about the possibility of creating policies using logical operators (AND/OR) for data detection criteria refinement.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with a focus on Content-Aware Protection and Predefined Content for PII data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the Intune configuration for deploying Client CA certificates to Macs.
2. Analyzed the existing PII data policy to identify potential misconfigurations or issues with file extension detection.
3. Investigated the capability of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to support logical operators in policy creation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the PII data policy incorrectly detecting non-PII data was identified as a misconfiguration in the policy settings, particularly related to file extension rules and potential regressions in the detection algorithm.

## Solution
To resolve the issues:
1. Provided guidance on how to correctly configure Intune for deploying Client CA certificates to Macs.
2. Suggested adjustments to the PII data policy to refine the detection criteria, ensuring that only actual PII data is flagged. This included reviewing and updating file extension rules.
3. Confirmed that logical operators (AND/OR) can be used in policy creation and provided detailed instructions on how to implement this feature.

## Notes
- Ensure that all policy configurations are regularly reviewed to prevent similar issues in the future.
- When deploying certificates or creating policies, always verify the settings to ensure they align with the intended outcomes.
- Document any changes made to policies for future reference and troubleshooting.
