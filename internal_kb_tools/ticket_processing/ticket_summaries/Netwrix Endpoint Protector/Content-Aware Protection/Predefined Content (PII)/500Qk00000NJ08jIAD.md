## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NJ08jIAD
- **Case Number:** 439902
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Sai Nachiappan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2000

## Problem Description
The customer reported that predefined policies for blocking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Social Security Numbers (SSN) were not functioning as expected. Specifically, while PNG files were being blocked, JPG files were not, and attempts to block email domains were also ineffective.

## Environment Details
- The client was using version 6.2.4.2000 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) feature was enabled for detecting PII and SSN.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the client's device to investigate the issue.
2. Verified that the latest version (6.2.4.2000) was installed.
3. Checked the Content-Aware Protection (CAP) policy settings:
   - Confirmed that no specific file types were selected for blocking.
   - Ensured that the exit points and predefined content were correctly configured.
4. Reviewed the computer settings to confirm that OCR and DPI (Dots Per Inch) settings were enabled.
5. Enabled monitoring for webmail and configured it for Gmail.
6. Conducted tests by uploading various file types (TXT, PNG, JPG, PDF) to Gmail:
   - Only TXT and PNG files were detected and reported; JPG and PDF files passed through without detection.
7. Collected logs and instructed the client to attach them to the ticket for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the OCR detection capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, particularly with JPG and PDF file formats. The CAP policy was not configured to block these file types explicitly, leading to their bypassing the predefined content detection.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming the settings and ensuring that the OCR feature was functioning correctly. The client was advised to review their CAP policy settings to include specific configurations for JPG and PDF files if they wanted to block these formats in the future. The ticket was closed upon the client's request after confirming that they were satisfied with the troubleshooting steps taken.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all relevant file types are included in the CAP policy to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Clients should be made aware of the limitations of OCR detection with certain file formats and the necessity of configuring policies accordingly.
