- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DFptzIAD
- **Case Number:** 415433
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Adarma Security
- **Contact Name:** one two
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that every time they logged into Twitter, access was blocked due to the CAP Policy related to Predefined Content, specifically credit card information. The customer sought clarification on what was triggering this block and how to bypass it without excluding Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Content-Aware Protection feature, specifically the Predefined Content (PII) settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs to identify what content was being flagged as PII.
2. Discussed potential solutions with the DevOps team, including ignoring specific requests that were incorrectly flagged.
3. Proposed a test build to ignore the scanning of requests containing the flagged content.
4. Suggested whitelisting the "x.com" domain as a workaround.
5. Collected feedback from the customer after testing the new build.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the detection of a substring from the `x-transaction-id` key in the request header, which was incorrectly interpreted as a credit card number by the Content-Aware Protection feature.

## Solution
- A test build was provided to the customer that included a fix to ignore the specific request that contained the flagged content. 
- The customer was advised to reinstall the client and ensure that all certificates were up to date and trusted.
- After testing the new build, the customer confirmed that the issue was no longer reproducible.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any test builds are only installed on a limited number of machines for testing purposes.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking DPI settings and ensuring that the client is properly configured with trusted certificates.
- Always collect extended DPI logs if problems persist after applying fixes.
