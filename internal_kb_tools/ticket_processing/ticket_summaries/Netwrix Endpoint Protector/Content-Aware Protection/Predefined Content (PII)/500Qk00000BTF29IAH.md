## Problem Description
Sensitive data is not being detected and blocked when users attempt to copy and paste it into WhatsApp.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurs on both the WhatsApp Web and desktop applications.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry to gather more details about the issue, including whether it occurs on WhatsApp Web or desktop.
2. Scheduled a call with the customer to discuss the issue further.
3. During the call, discussed the possibility of adjusting the threat threshold settings in the Content-Aware Protection policy.
4. Suggested creating a new policy with a "Report Only" action to monitor file transfers.
5. Recommended modifying the threshold to 1 to ensure that any sensitive data transfer would require approval.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the threshold settings in the Content-Aware Protection policy. The existing threshold was set too high, preventing the detection of sensitive data when it was copied and pasted.

## Solution
- Adjusted the threat threshold in the Content-Aware Protection policy to 1. This change ensures that any file containing at least one sensitive data item will be flagged and require approval for transfer.
- Informed the customer that they can also create a new policy with a "Report Only" action to monitor file transfers without blocking them.

## Notes
- It is crucial to set the threat threshold appropriately based on the organization's needs. A threshold set too high may lead to undetected sensitive data transfers.
- Future cases should consider the specific use cases of the customer when configuring Content-Aware Protection settings to avoid similar issues.
