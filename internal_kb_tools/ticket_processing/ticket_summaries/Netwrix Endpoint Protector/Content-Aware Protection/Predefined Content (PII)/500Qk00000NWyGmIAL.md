- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)

## Problem Description
The customer, Ismail Reyhanoglu from DataVisor, requested assistance in creating content-aware policies within Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Specifically, he wanted to monitor Google Chrome and apply PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stoppage only on specific websites, such as slack.com.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** Content-Aware Protection (CAP)
- **Specific Requirement:** URL-based policy application for PII detection

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initiated communication with the customer to understand their requirements.
2. Scheduled a remote session to provide detailed guidance on configuring CAP policies.
3. During the remote session, explained the use of URL Categories in CAP policies.
4. Demonstrated how to block uploads of predefined content specifically for designated websites.

## Root Cause
The customer lacked clarity on how to effectively combine content-aware policies with URL-specific restrictions within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by conducting a remote session where the following was accomplished:
- Explained how to utilize URL Categories in CAP policies to restrict uploads of predefined content (PII) specifically on selected websites like slack.com.
- Confirmed that the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature must be enabled for URL Categories to function correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the DPI feature is enabled when configuring URL Categories for CAP policies.
- Future users should be aware that combining multiple policy types may require additional training or documentation to fully understand the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
