## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KwZTOIA3
- **Case Number:** 433214
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FC Brasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Content-Aware Protection
- **Feature:** Predefined Content (PII)
- **Version:** 5.9.4.3 (planned for release)

## Problem Description
Customers reported issues with the Brazilian CPF (ID/BR) detection system, which was generating false positives. The system was incorrectly identifying content that did not match the expected format for CPF numbers, leading to inconsistencies in detection.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed after an upgrade to version 5941.
- Customers were using regex as a temporary workaround while the issue was being investigated.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation:** Gathered information from the customer regarding the false positives.
2. **Remote Session:** Conducted a remote session to replicate the issue and generate logs.
3. **Version Upgrade:** Upgraded the EPP server and client to version 5941 to test if the issue was resolved.
4. **Feedback Collection:** Collected feedback from the customer after the upgrade to determine if the issue persisted.
5. **Escalation:** Raised the priority of the ticket to critical due to multiple customers experiencing the same issue.
6. **Communication with R&D:** Engaged with the R&D team to confirm if fixes were included in the latest versions and to discuss potential custom builds.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a flaw in the detection algorithm for Brazilian PII, which was generating false positives due to the inclusion of formats that were not adequately defined. The detection rules were too broad, leading to incorrect identification of non-CPF content.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Sharing a custom build based on version 5941 that specifically altered the definition of the Brazilian PII pattern to limit it only to Brazilian CPF.
- The custom build was tested on a limited number of machines to confirm its effectiveness.
- Future updates were planned to split Brazilian PII and CPF detection, allowing customers to choose which patterns to use.

## Notes
- Customers should be informed that the test builds provided are not to be shared with other customers as they are still in testing phases.
- It is important to monitor the logs for any bypass events and ensure that the detection algorithm is functioning as intended after the implementation of the new build.
- Further testing and feedback from the customer are crucial to confirm the resolution of the issue before the official release of version 5.9.4.3.
