## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to block uploads over Cloud Drive applications in their Endpoint Protector (EPP) environment. They noted that all other policies were functioning correctly.

## Environment Details
- The issue was occurring in the customer's in-house environment, not in the customer environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. A remote session was scheduled to investigate the issue.
2. During the session, it was discovered that the customer had configured DPI Monitored URL Categories.
3. The support team informed the customer that the Endpoint Protector enforced the Content Aware Protection (CAP) Policy only on domains included in the URL categories.
4. It was clarified that because the URL category was enabled, the policy was not enforced on other domains.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the configuration of DPI Monitored URL Categories, which limited the enforcement of the CAP Policy to only those domains specified in the URL categories. As a result, uploads to other domains were not being blocked.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer was informed about the configuration of the URL categories. They were able to adjust their settings accordingly, and after further testing, the policy began to work as intended. The customer confirmed that the policy was functioning correctly and requested to close the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that customers are aware of how URL categories affect policy enforcement in Endpoint Protector.
- If similar issues arise, verify the configuration of URL categories and DPI settings to ensure policies are applied correctly across all intended domains.
