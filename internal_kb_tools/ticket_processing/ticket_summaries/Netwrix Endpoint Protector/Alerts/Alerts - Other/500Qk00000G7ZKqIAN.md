## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where print jobs were being blocked despite the absence of the "Browser Printing" policy in their configuration.

## Environment Details
- **Policy Name:** Browser Printing
- **Policy Type:** Predefined Content
- **Items Type:** Print job
- **Matched Items Count:** 1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing policies and confirmed that the "Browser Printing" policy was not configured.
2. Analyzed the system parameters and scanning exceptions to identify any potential whitelisting issues.
3. Conducted a remote session with the customer to further investigate the print job blocking.

## Root Cause
The print job was being blocked because the application "Outlook" was not included in the whitelisted applications under the "Advanced Scanning Exceptions" settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the process name "Outlook" to the whitelisted applications in the following location:
- **Path:** System Parameters > Advanced Scanning Exceptions

## Notes
- Ensure that any applications that require printing are added to the whitelist to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update the scanning exceptions to accommodate changes in the environment or application usage.
