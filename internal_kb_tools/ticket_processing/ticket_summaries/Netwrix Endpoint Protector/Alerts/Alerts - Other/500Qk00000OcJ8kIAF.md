## Problem Description
The customer, Tech Wave Consulting India, reported receiving continuous notifications regarding the impending closure of their AWS account (Account ID: 097681509660), which was scheduled to be permanently closed within 15 days. The customer requested an investigation into the reason behind these alerts.

## Environment Details
- The customer's instance is hosted by Netwrix AWS.
- The server URL: https://ew2l29w.hosted.endpointprotector.com

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reached out to Oana Nemes to check the account status.
2. Informed the customer success team via email about the issue.
3. Forwarded the inquiry to the DevOps team as per customer success' request.
4. The DevOps team confirmed that the customer's server was operational and not affected by the AWS account closure.

## Root Cause
The alerts regarding the AWS account closure were due to the account being owned by the customer, Tech Wave Consulting India. However, the customer's instance was hosted on a separate AWS infrastructure managed by Netwrix, which was not impacted by the closure of the account.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming with the DevOps team that the customer's server was up and running and would not be affected by the closure of the AWS account. The customer was informed that their instance was secure and operational, alleviating their concerns regarding the account closure notifications.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to customers that alerts regarding AWS account closures may not necessarily impact their services if they are hosted on a different infrastructure.
- Future communications should ensure that customers are aware of the distinction between their AWS account and the hosting arrangements made by Netwrix.
