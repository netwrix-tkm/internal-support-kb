## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Mo1U9IAJ
- **Case Number:** 438446
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ARB Interactive
- **Contact Name:** Olivier Adamczyk
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Olivier Adamczyk, reported issues with sending email alerts from Netwrix Endpoint Protector while using Google Mail as the email host. Despite applying the recommended email settings and creating an SMTP relay, test emails were not being received.

## Environment Details
- **Email Host:** Google Mail
- **Hosting Platform:** Hosted by EPP (Endpoint Protector)
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to switch multiple ports and toggle between SSL and TLS settings.
2. Customer confirmed the setup of 2-factor authentication (2FA) on their Google account.
3. Customer initially used their Google Workspace account password in the SMTP configuration.
4. Support recommended creating an app password for SMTP configuration instead of using the account password.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the use of the Google Workspace account password instead of an app password for SMTP authentication. Google requires the use of app passwords when 2FA is enabled for third-party applications.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer created an app password in their Google account settings and used that app password in the SMTP configuration for Endpoint Protector. This allowed the test emails to be successfully sent.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers using Google Mail with 2FA enabled are instructed to create and use an app password for SMTP configurations.
- Document any specific settings or configurations that may be required for different email hosts to prevent similar issues in the future.
