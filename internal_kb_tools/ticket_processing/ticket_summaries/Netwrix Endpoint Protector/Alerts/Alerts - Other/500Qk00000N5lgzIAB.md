## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Endpoint Protector (EPP) software was randomly blocking valid websites, causing alerts. This issue occurred intermittently, and after some time, the alerts would cease when the sites were re-checked.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server Version: 5.7.0.0
- The customer was using the EPP in a research capacity, frequently accessing various websites and AI applications.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested additional details regarding the EPP version and whether the DPI module was in use.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. Verified the EPP console during the remote session and confirmed the server version.
4. Recommended an upgrade to the latest version of EPP.

## Root Cause
The issue was attributed to the outdated version of the EPP software (5.7.0.0), which may have had bugs or limitations in its URL filtering capabilities, leading to the random blocking of valid sites.

## Solution
The resolution involved recommending an upgrade to the latest version of the EPP software. The following steps were provided for the upgrade:
- Take a snapshot from the virtualization environment.
- Log in to the EPP UI with an Admin user.
- Navigate to the dashboard menu and select "Live Update."
- Click on "Check for Updates."
- Check the checkbox next to the available update and press "Apply Updates."
- Wait for the progress bar to finish and refresh the tab.
- Revert to the snapshot if necessary.

After the upgrade, the customer was advised to monitor the situation to see if the issue persisted.

## Notes
- It is crucial to keep the EPP software updated to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the problem recurs after the upgrade, further investigation may be needed to check for any denylist or allowlist configurations that could be affecting URL access.
