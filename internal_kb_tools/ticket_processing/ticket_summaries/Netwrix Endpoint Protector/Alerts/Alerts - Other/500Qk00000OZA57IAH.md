## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space, with only 6.7 GB free out of 19.52 GB (34% remaining). This low disk space could severely affect the functionality and performance of the EPP Server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the /root partition, which had high disk usage.
- The journal in /var/log was also consuming significant disk space.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared disk space on the /root partition, reducing usage from 66% to 54%.
2. Vacuumed the journal from /var/log, reducing its size from 2.5 GB to 100 MB.
3. Communicated with the customer to confirm if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was excessive disk usage on the /root partition and the /var/log directory, primarily due to accumulated logs and system backups.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing unnecessary files and backups to free up disk space on the /root partition.
- Vacuuming the log journal to significantly reduce its size, thereby freeing additional disk space.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk space and implement log management practices, such as using Audit Log Backup to manage log sizes and deleting older backups.
- Customers should be advised to tune their policies to reduce the incoming log count to prevent similar issues in the future.
