- **Case Number:** 441854
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Averis Sdn Bhd.
- **Contact Name:** Sharnitha Seethaiah
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other
- **Version:** 15.04

## Problem Description
The customer, Chai Cheen Shun from Averis Sdn. Bhd., raised a query regarding the behavior of email alerts in Endpoint Protector (EPP). They observed inconsistencies in the timing and activity count reported in email alerts, specifically wanting to know the expected delay between an alert trigger and the corresponding email notification.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 15.04.
- The alerts are triggered based on specific thresholds or predefined intervals.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** The customer inquired about the delay in email alerts and the criteria for the number of activities reported.
2. **Remote Session Scheduled:** A remote session was scheduled for April 17, 2025, to discuss the issues in detail.
3. **Remote Session Conducted:** During the session:
   - Explained how alerts are sent based on time and thresholds.
   - Tested file copy alerts and discussed various scenarios with the customer.
   - Advised on adjusting client-server communication time, recommending a setting of 60 seconds to avoid excessive resource usage.

## Root Cause
The inconsistencies in email alerts were due to the alerting mechanism in EPP, which sends alerts either when a specific threshold (100 logs) is reached or at predefined intervals (every 2 minutes). This dual mechanism can lead to varying numbers of activities reported in alerts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the alerting mechanism:
- Alerts are sent in bulk when 100 logs are reached or every 2 minutes, regardless of the number of logs.
- The customer was informed that the thresholds for alerts cannot be configured to avoid server overload.
- The customer confirmed understanding of the alerting process, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- The customer expressed a need for more prompt email alerts. It is important to communicate that alerts will not be sent until the thresholds are met, which may delay immediate action.
- Future inquiries regarding alert configurations should emphasize the limitations imposed to prevent server overload.
