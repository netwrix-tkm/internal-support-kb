- **Case Number:** 443592
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Amount
- **Contact Name:** Don Stewart
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance on how to stop end users from receiving alerts generated by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). They wanted to prevent these alerts from popping up on endpoints but could not find the relevant control in the policy settings.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Issue Type:** Best Practices Question

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's current policy settings to identify any existing configurations related to end-user notifications.
2. Provided guidance on how to access and modify the client mode settings in the EPP.
3. Explained the process to disable client notifications for Content Aware Protection policies.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the EPP client being set to "Normal" mode, which allows pop-up notifications to be displayed to users. The customer was unaware of the "Silent" mode option that suppresses these notifications.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were recommended:
1. Change the EPP client mode to "Silent":
   - Navigate to **Device Control -> Global Settings**.
   - Search for **Client Mode** and select **Silent**.
   - This mode will:
     - Display the system tray icon.
     - Not display system tray notifications.
     - Apply all configured rights and settings.
   
2. For Content Aware Protection policies:
   - Access **Content Aware Protection -> Content Aware Policies**.
   - Edit the desired policy and search for **Client Notifications**.
   - Disable the notifications for each policy where alerts should not be shown.

Additional resources were provided for further details on client mode settings.

## Notes
- Each Content Aware Policy has its own notification settings, and the customer must manually disable notifications for each policy where alerts are not desired.
- For future reference, ensure that customers are aware of the different client modes available in EPP to prevent similar issues.
