- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stadtwerke Wolfenb√ºttel GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Alan Wenglord
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying a hotfix, alerts for prohibited devices were not being sent. A server restart was performed, but the issue persisted. The workaround provided by support did not resolve the problem.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the issue:** 3.7 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the application of the hotfix.
2. Restarted the server to refresh the system.
3. Verified the implementation of the workaround provided by support.
4. Attempted to establish a remote connection for further diagnostics.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case notes. However, it was determined that the alert cache was not functioning correctly, which prevented alerts from being sent.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by recreating the alert cache. This action restored the functionality of the alert system, allowing notifications for prohibited devices to be sent as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that the alert cache is regularly maintained to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If alerts fail to send after applying updates or hotfixes, consider recreating the alert cache as a first troubleshooting step.
- Document any changes made to the system configuration or updates applied to assist in future troubleshooting efforts.
