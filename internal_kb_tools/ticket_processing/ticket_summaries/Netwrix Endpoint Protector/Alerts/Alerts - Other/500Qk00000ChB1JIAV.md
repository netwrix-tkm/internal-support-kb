- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ChB1JIAV
- **Case Number:** 414150
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BKT Tires
- **Contact Name:** Anand Ghogale
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to download File Tracing Logs in PDF format, causing the application to hang during the process.

## Environment Details
- **Application:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to provide the version of the EPP server and any error messages encountered during the download attempt.
2. Scheduled a remote session to observe the problem directly.
3. During the remote session, discussed the limitations of exporting logs in PDF format versus CSV format.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation of the PDF export functionality in the application. The PDF export only includes logs displayed on the current page, which can lead to incomplete data if many logs are filtered. Additionally, exporting a large number of logs (thousands) in PDF format can cause performance issues, leading to application hangs.

## Solution
The customer was advised to use the export as a CSV option instead of PDF. This method allows for the export of all filtered logs and is better suited for handling large datasets, as CSV files can accommodate a higher number of lines compared to PDF files.

## Notes
- For future reference, when dealing with large datasets in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, always recommend exporting logs in CSV format to avoid performance issues and ensure complete data retrieval.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the limitations of the PDF export functionality to prevent similar issues from arising.
