## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N5uIsIAJ
- **Case Number:** 439297
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Averis Sdn Bhd.
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Averis, was unable to integrate their SMTP server with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) to receive email alerts. Despite multiple attempts, they could not achieve the desired configuration.

## Environment Details
- SMTP Server: Microsoft Exchange (on-premises)
- Email Security Gateway: Symantec Email Security Gateway
- Required Port: 25

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial request for a remote session to assist with SMTP configuration.
2. Confirmed the SMTP service provider and gathered details about the configuration.
3. Sent a request to product security to allow port 25.
4. Conducted PING and TELNET tests from the EPP server to the customer's SMTP server.
5. R&D team provided steps to clear and reconfigure the SMTP settings.
6. Partner shared feedback and configuration steps with the customer.
7. Followed up on the status of email alerts and logs for failed alerts.

## Root Cause
The initial inability to integrate the SMTP server was due to the blocking of port 25 by AWS, which is commonly restricted to prevent spam. Once the port was opened, the customer could receive email alerts, but some alerts still failed.

## Solution
1. The R&D team advised the customer to clear the existing SMTP configuration and re-enter the details.
2. The customer was instructed to verify the SMTP settings and send a test email to confirm functionality.
3. After confirming the port was opened by AWS, the customer was able to receive most email alerts, although some still failed.
4. The partner was informed that further investigation into the logs was needed to understand the reasons for the failed alerts.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future requests for SMTP integration consider the potential restrictions on port 25 by AWS.
- It is advisable to verify SMTP configurations thoroughly and conduct tests after any changes.
- If alerts continue to fail, check the message queues on the Symantec Messaging Gateway to ensure emails are not being blocked.
