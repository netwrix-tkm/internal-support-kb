## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with configuring SMTP on their EPP instance using the Postmark service. Despite multiple authentication attempts, the SMTP configuration was not functioning as expected.

## Environment Details
- SMTP Server: `smtp.postmarkapp.com`
- SMTP Service: Postmark

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Suggested the customer try using alternative SMTP services like Gmail or Office 365, which they declined.
2. Requested a screenshot of the SMTP settings to diagnose the issue further.
3. Clarified that there should be no server-side blocks unless a relay was being used instead of a direct SMTP server.
4. Conducted a remote session to review the SMTP configuration.
5. Performed connectivity tests to the Postmark SMTP server, including:
   - Ping test to `smtp.postmarkapp.com`
   - Telnet test to port 587 of `smtp.postmarkapp.com`

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a network configuration problem on the customer's end, which prevented the EPP server from reaching the Postmark SMTP server. The ping test indicated 100% packet loss, confirming that the server could not connect to the SMTP service.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to review and adjust their network configuration to allow outbound connections to the Postmark SMTP server. After making the necessary changes, the SMTP configuration was successfully established.

## Notes
- Ensure that any SMTP server used is reachable from the EPP server to avoid similar connectivity issues.
- Advise customers to check their firewall and network settings if they encounter issues with SMTP configurations in the future.
- Document any specific network configurations that may be required for third-party SMTP services like Postmark.
