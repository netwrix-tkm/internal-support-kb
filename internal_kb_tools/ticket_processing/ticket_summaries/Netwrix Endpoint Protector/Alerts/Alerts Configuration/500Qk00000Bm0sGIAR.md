## Problem Description
The customer reported that users were experiencing unwanted notification alerts popping up on their computers due to monitoring policies in place. They requested guidance on how to disable these notifications globally.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically related to Content Aware Protection policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps

   - **Content Aware Protection** -> **Content Aware Policies**
2. The customer was advised to edit the policies and turn off **Client Notifications**.
3. Follow-up communication confirmed that disabling Client Notifications would not affect email notifications regarding user activity based on the policies.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the enabled Client Notifications within the Content Aware Policies, which were designed to alert users about monitoring activities.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to disable Client Notifications in the Content Aware Policies. This action effectively stopped the pop-up alerts from appearing on users' computers while still allowing the collection of activity logs on the server.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that while disabling Client Notifications will stop user alerts, they will still receive email notifications regarding user activities based on the policies.
- Ensure that customers understand the implications of disabling notifications, as it may affect their awareness of user activities.
