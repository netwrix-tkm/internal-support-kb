## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O2fUHIAZ
- **Case Number:** 441982
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Robins Kaplan
- **Contact Name:** Nicoleta Cornea
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts Configuration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SMTP configuration for their Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was not functioning as expected. They were not receiving any alerts, indicating that the initial proof of concept (POC) testing configuration from March 2024 was not operational.

## Environment Details
- The customer switched their SMTP configuration to use Mimecast as the email provider.
- The customer was using a custom email sender address and was inquiring about the password complexity requirements for the EPP.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Advised the customer to add an email address to the administrator account used for logging into the EPP server.
2. Verified the connection between EPP and Mimecast SMTP servers, which was confirmed to be operational.
3. Recommended the customer set a custom email sender address and check if TLS 1.3 was enabled on their SMTP server.
4. Conducted a remote session with the customer and Mimecast team to further investigate the issue.
5. Reset the SMTP account password to a shorter one during the remote session, which resolved the issue.
6. Confirmed with the customer that the 25-character password limit was enforced.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the SMTP account password exceeding the character limit enforced by Mimecast. The customer was unaware of this limitation, which prevented successful authentication and email delivery.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Resetting the SMTP account password to a shorter length that complied with Mimecast's requirements.
- The customer successfully tested the configuration after the password change and confirmed that alerts were being received.

## Notes
- The customer is still investigating the password complexity requirements for EPP, specifically the maximum acceptable length and allowed special characters.
- Future users should ensure that SMTP passwords comply with the provider's limitations to avoid similar issues.
- It is recommended to verify the SMTP settings and test email functionality after any configuration changes to ensure proper operation.
