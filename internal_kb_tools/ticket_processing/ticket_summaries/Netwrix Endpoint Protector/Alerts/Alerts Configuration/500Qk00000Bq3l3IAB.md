- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts Configuration

## Problem Description
The customer reported that alerts were no longer being sent when a blocked device, such as a USB stick, was connected. This functionality had previously worked without issues, and no changes were made to the system settings or notification rules.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The alerts were configured to notify the user via email upon the connection of blocked devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the alert notification rules were still present and unchanged.
2. Cleared the alert queues to ensure no backlog was preventing notifications.
3. Deleted all entries related to alerts and the mailer to reset the notification system.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a backlog in the alert queues, which prevented the system from sending out notifications. Clearing the queues resolved the issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the alert queues and deleting all entries related to alerts and the mailer. This action reset the notification system, allowing alerts to be sent as intended.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the alert queues periodically to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that any changes to the alert configuration are documented to facilitate troubleshooting if issues arise again.
