- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Caaliope
- **Contact Name:** Ernesto Ortega
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts Configuration
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they stopped receiving email alerts from Netwrix Endpoint Protector approximately 20 days prior to opening the support ticket. Despite checking the email settings and performing a software update, the issue persisted.

## Environment Details
- **Software Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Feature Affected:** Email Alerts

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified email settings in System Configuration > System Settings > Email System Settings.
2. Performed a software update to version 5.9.4.1.
3. Confirmed that the software update was successful but did not resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a backlog of alerts that were pending processing, which caused the alerts to become stuck and prevented new alerts from being sent.

## Solution
The support team cleared the pending alerts and recreated the alert cache. This action resolved the issue, allowing the customer to start receiving email alerts again.

## Notes
- It is strongly recommended to monitor and reduce the number of alerts generated to prevent similar issues in the future, as high volumes of alerts can lead to processing delays and blockages.
