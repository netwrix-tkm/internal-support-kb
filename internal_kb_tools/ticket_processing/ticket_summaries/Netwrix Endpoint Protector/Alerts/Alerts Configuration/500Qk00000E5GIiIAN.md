- **Contact Name:** Henrique Praxedes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts Configuration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that there are currently no alerts generated by the system when a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is modified by an administrator or privileged user. They requested alerts for each privileged action performed by these users, including details such as which policy was edited, the timestamp, and what changes were made.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature Request Type:** Missing functionality / Feature request

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing functionality of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding alert generation for DLP policy modifications.
2. Confirmed that no alerts are currently triggered for changes made by administrators or privileged users.
3. Documented the customer's request and added it to the enhancement roadmap for future consideration.
4. Linked the request to existing tickets in the old system for reference.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a missing functionality in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector that does not currently support alert generation for modifications made to DLP policies by privileged users.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the feature request to the EPP Unify roadmap and the ProductBoard for future development. This ensures that the request for alerting on DLP policy changes will be considered in upcoming updates.

## Notes
- The request for alerts on DLP policy modifications is now officially documented and prioritized for future releases.
- Customers should be aware that while this feature is being considered, it is not currently available, and they should monitor updates from Netwrix for any changes regarding this functionality.
- Previous tickets related to this issue were referenced for context and to avoid duplication of requests.
