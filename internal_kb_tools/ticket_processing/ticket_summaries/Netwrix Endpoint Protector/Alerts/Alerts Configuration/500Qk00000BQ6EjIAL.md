## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BQ6EjIAL
- **Case Number:** 410909
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Alerts
- **Feature:** Alerts Configuration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that email alerts were still being sent to an Active Directory administrator's email address that had been deleted from the EPP server. Despite disabling the SMTP server configuration, notifications continued to be received.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The customer had previously removed the administrator from the system but continued to receive alerts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested a video demonstration of the issue from the customer.
2. Inquired whether the administrator had been removed from the alert configuration.
3. Scheduled remote sessions to investigate the issue further.
4. Collected additional details during remote sessions and forwarded them to the R&D team for analysis.
5. Discussed the configuration of the Transfer Limit alerts and the settings for email notifications.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the system still retaining the deleted administrator's configuration in the alert settings, which led to continued email notifications being sent to that address.

## Solution
- The technical support team, with assistance from development, removed the super admin tag for the deleted administrators from the system.
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation after whitelisting the email address and to ensure that only the desired super administrator received the transfer limit reports.
- The Transfer Limit Reached Report was set to weekly, and the super administrator option was removed for users who should not receive the alerts.

## Notes
- If the Transfer Limit alert is disabled from the Global settings, it will not generate reports either.
- For future cases, if a customer requests to disable email alerts while keeping the feature enabled, it is recommended to open a new case for a feature request to the management team.
- Customers should be advised to regularly review their alert configurations to ensure that only the intended recipients are set up to receive notifications.
