## Problem Description
The customer reported that they created policies for Content Aware Protection (CAP) and Device Control alerts in the system, but they were not receiving any alerts. Additionally, email alerts were not being sent despite SMTP configuration.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The email configuration was not set for the root user.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the CAP and Device Control alert policies.
2. Checked the SMTP settings to ensure they were correctly configured.
3. Identified that the email was not set for the root user, which could prevent alerts from being sent.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the email address for the root user was not configured, which resulted in the failure to send alerts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by configuring the email address for the root user. Once this was done, the alerts began to function as expected, and the customer confirmed that the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that the email configuration for all relevant users, especially the root user, is set up correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify alert configurations and SMTP settings to ensure they are functioning as intended.
