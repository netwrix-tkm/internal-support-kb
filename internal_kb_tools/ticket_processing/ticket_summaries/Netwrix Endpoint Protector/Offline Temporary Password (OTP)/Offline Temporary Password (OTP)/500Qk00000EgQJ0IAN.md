## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EgQJ0IAN
- **Case Number:** 418592
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AconSeg
- **Contact Name:** Mariano Amigo
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Offline Temporary Password (OTP) feature, where the epp-client did not load CAP policies after entering a CAP OTP code. This issue was suspected to have begun following an update to the console and agents.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after updating the console and agents to the latest version.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs for error messages related to policy loading.
2. Confirmed the presence of the message: "Skipping policy load because a CAP password is in effect."
3. Verified the OTP status in the logs, noting the message: "OTP status: Active CAP: x..."
4. Investigated the behavior of the epp-client when a CAP OTP code was entered.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a bug but rather a designed behavior of the epp-client. When a CAP OTP code is active, the epp-client does not populate the active policies list, resulting in the CAP tab being hidden.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying to the customer that the observed behavior was expected. The epp-client's design prevents the loading of CAP policies when a CAP OTP code is active, which is indicated by specific log messages.

## Notes
- It is important for future reference to communicate clearly to customers that certain behaviors may not indicate a malfunction but rather a feature of the system.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the implications of using CAP OTP codes on policy visibility within the epp-client.
