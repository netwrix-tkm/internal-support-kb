## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C4s4XIAR
- **Case Number:** 412471
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NBC Universal
- **Contact Name:** Andrew Peach
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that offline temporary passwords (OTP) were not functioning after a power outage caused by a UPS failure, which resulted in the EPP server VM losing power. After the server was rebooted and a file system repair was performed, users were unable to issue temporary passwords to mount external drives.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Incident Date:** June 20, 2024

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer initiated a file system repair after the server reboot.
2. The WebUI was checked and appeared to be functioning without errors.
3. Multiple attempts were made to issue temporary passwords from different client machines, all resulting in failure.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the server time being out of sync, which affected the generation and validation of the OTP codes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by re-syncing the server time. After the time was corrected, the OTP codes began to function properly, allowing users to issue temporary passwords successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that server time is regularly synchronized, especially after power outages or unexpected shutdowns, to prevent similar issues with OTP functionality in the future.
- Consider implementing monitoring for server time discrepancies to proactively address potential issues before they affect users.
