## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IbWt0IAF
- **Case Number:** 427768
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IHK Region Stuttgart
- **Contact Name:** Florian Bartl
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Version:** 4.3

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance on how to grant a user temporary access to a USB storage device without requiring the user to input a One-Time Password (OTP). The customer wanted to manage this centrally as an administrator.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector for device control.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer confirmed that the only available solution for granting temporary access to USB devices in the described scenario is through the use of OTP.
2. The customer inquired about the limitation of viewing only 500 devices in the management interface, despite having more devices in their inventory.

## Root Cause
The limitation of requiring an OTP for granting temporary access to USB devices is a design feature of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Device Control functionality. Additionally, the display limitation of 500 devices is a configurable setting within the application.

## Solution
- The support engineer advised the customer to utilize the OTP feature for granting temporary access to USB devices as it is the only method supported by the system.
- For the issue regarding the display of devices, the support engineer instructed the customer to adjust the setting in "Device Control > Global Settings > Display Settings" to increase the limit from 500 to the desired number.

## Notes
- It is important for administrators to be aware that OTP is the only method for granting temporary access to USB devices in the current version of the software.
- Administrators should regularly check and adjust display settings to ensure all devices are visible in the management interface, especially in environments with a large number of devices.
