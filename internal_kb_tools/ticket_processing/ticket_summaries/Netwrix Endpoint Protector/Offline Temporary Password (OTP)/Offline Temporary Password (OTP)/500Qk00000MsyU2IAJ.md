## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MsyU2IAJ
- **Case Number:** 438684
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PSI CRO AG
- **Contact Name:** Jovan Salsone
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Version:** 1.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the validity period of an Offline Temporary Password (OTP) generated for a user. Specifically, they wanted to know if an OTP requested for 4 hours would still be valid if it was generated the previous day and used two weeks later.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's inquiry regarding the OTP validity.
2. Confirmed the OTP generation and expiration process.
3. Provided a clear explanation of how OTP validity is determined.

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from a misunderstanding of how the OTP validity period is calculated. The OTP is valid only for the duration specified at the time of its creation, starting from that moment.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the validity of the OTP starts when it is created. Therefore, if a user requests an OTP for 4 hours, it will expire exactly 4 hours after its generation, regardless of when the user plans to use it.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that OTPs are time-sensitive and must be used within the specified validity period to ensure security.
- Future inquiries regarding OTPs should clarify the time frame of validity to avoid similar misunderstandings.
