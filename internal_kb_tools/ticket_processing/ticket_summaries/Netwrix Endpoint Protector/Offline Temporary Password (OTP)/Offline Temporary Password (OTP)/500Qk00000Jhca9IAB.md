## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Jhca9IAB
- **Case Number:** 430327
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Geislinger GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Panagiotis Dragatis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Version:** Server version 5.9.4.1, Client version 6.2.4.1006

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating the EPP client to version 6.2.4.1006, the Offline Temporary Password (OTP) functionality stopped working. Users received an "invalid unlock code" message when attempting to use OTPs for CAP or Device Control.

## Environment Details
- Server Version: 5.9.4.1
- Client Version: 6.2.4.1006 (previously 6.2.3.1010 where OTP was functioning correctly)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by testing with the previous client version (6.2.3.1010) where OTP worked.
2. Collected logs during the reproduction of the issue.
3. Investigated the client logs for any errors related to OTP.
4. Escalated the issue to the engineering team for further analysis.
5. Identified that the upgrade to OpenSSL3 in the new client version caused compatibility issues with existing certificates.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a compatibility issue between the new client version (6.2.4.1006) and the existing certificates generated with OpenSSL1.1. The upgrade to OpenSSL3 rendered the old certificates unsupported, preventing the EPP client from extracting the computer ID necessary for OTP generation and validation.

## Solution
An offline patch was provided to the customer that included a fix for the OTP functionality. The patch can be downloaded from the following link:
```

```
The customer was advised to apply the patch, which resolved the OTP issue.

## Notes
- Customers who upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 and experience OTP issues should apply the offline patch to restore functionality.
- It is recommended to release licenses and restart the EPP service or the client machine after applying the patch to ensure proper operation.
- Future updates should consider compatibility with existing certificates to prevent similar issues.
