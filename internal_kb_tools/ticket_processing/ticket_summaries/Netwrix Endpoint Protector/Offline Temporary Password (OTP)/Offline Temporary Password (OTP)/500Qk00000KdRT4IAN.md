- **Case Number:** 432181
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SHW AG
- **Contact Name:** Christian Kopf
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Feature:** Offline Temporary Password (OTP)
- **Version:** 1.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the generated One-Time Password (OTP) only worked when selecting a user, but resulted in an "Invalid Authorisation Code" error when a computer name was selected.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically related to the Offline Temporary Password feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the OTP generation process for both user and computer name selections.
2. Attempted to generate OTPs for various computer names to replicate the issue.
3. Reviewed logs for any error messages or anomalies during the OTP generation process.
4. Documented the behavior of the OTP system when selecting different identifiers (user vs. computer name).
5. Proposed an ADO escalation for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a bug in the OTP generation process that prevented valid OTPs from being recognized when associated with computer names.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying an offline patch that corrected the OTP generation logic, allowing OTPs to be successfully generated and validated for both users and computer names.

## Notes
- Ensure that all users are aware of the need to apply the latest patches to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the OTP functionality after updates to confirm that the issue does not recur.
