## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Opv4sIAB
- **Case Number:** 444170
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Helsing
- **Contact Name:** Kerem Sevil
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** 8.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Kerem Sevil, reported that after configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Entra and assigning a user group, their account did not display the full dashboard as expected. They were concerned that their access level was not equivalent to that of non-SSO users.

## Environment Details
- SSO configured with Microsoft Entra.
- User group assigned for SSO access.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the SSO configuration settings to check for the "Import users as super-administrators" option.
2. Confirmed that the option to grant Superadmin permissions was not enabled during the initial SSO setup.
3. Explained that enabling the Superadmin option post-setup does not retroactively apply to existing SSO users.
4. Informed the customer that permissions for SSO users can be manually updated in the System Configuration > System Administrator page.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the default configuration of SSO, which does not grant Superadmin permissions to users unless explicitly configured during the setup process. The absence of the "Import users as super-administrators" option during the initial setup resulted in limited access for the SSO user.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually updating the permissions for Kerem Sevil's account in the System Configuration > System Administrator section, granting them Superadmin rights. The customer was advised that the same manual permission update process could be applied to other SSO users as needed.

## Notes
- For any additional SSO users requiring Superadmin access, their permissions must be updated manually in the System Configuration.
- Future SSO users should have their permissions reviewed and updated as necessary during the onboarding process.
- If further issues arise with SSO permissions or dashboard access, the customer should contact support for additional troubleshooting.
