## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MK5RyIAL
- **Case Number:** 437058
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HSC
- **Contact Name:** Maneesh Garg
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). After enabling SSO, users were unable to log in using either local or Active Directory (AD) credentials.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Authentication Method:** Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the SSO issue.
2. Tested connectivity and initiated AD synchronization during the session.
3. Noted that the issue persisted even after the initial AD sync.
4. Scheduled a follow-up remote session to further troubleshoot.
5. In the subsequent session, managed to sync AD groups but found that imported users still could not log in with AD credentials.
6. Scheduled another session for further investigation.
7. Successfully resolved the issue by adding the necessary suffix to the AD settings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the login issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the AD settings, specifically the absence of a required suffix that was necessary for proper authentication.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session by adding the appropriate suffix to the AD settings. After making this change, testing was conducted with two users, both of whom were able to log in successfully using their AD credentials.

## Notes
- Ensure that the AD settings are correctly configured with the necessary suffix to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is recommended to test the login functionality with multiple users after making changes to the AD configuration to confirm that the issue is fully resolved.
