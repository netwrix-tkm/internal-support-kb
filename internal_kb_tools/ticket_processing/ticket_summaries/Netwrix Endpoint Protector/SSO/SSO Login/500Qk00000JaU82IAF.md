## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JaU82IAF
- **Case Number:** 430040
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CMS Reich-Rohrwig Hainz Rechtsanw√§lte GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Matthias Penzinger
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after a Linux backend update, Single Sign-On (SSO) login was not possible. Users experienced a login loop where, after successful authentication, the login process would restart.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the Issue:** 3.0 days since the problem was reported.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the SSO configuration settings.
2. Checked the logs for any error messages related to the SSO authentication process.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue in a controlled environment.
4. Engaged in a remote session with the customer to further diagnose the problem.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the backend update that altered the SSO authentication process, leading to a failure in maintaining the session state after successful login.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session by applying the backend procedure 68, which corrected the session handling for SSO logins, allowing users to authenticate successfully without looping back to the login screen.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future backend updates are tested in a staging environment before deployment to prevent similar issues.
- Document any changes made during backend updates to facilitate troubleshooting in case of future problems.
