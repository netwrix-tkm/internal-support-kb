## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IJvD7IAL
- **Case Number:** 427103
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Morton Community Bank
- **Contact Name:** Joel Cox
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** 1.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to log in using a service account for Active Directory (AD) authentication to sync administrators. The service account worked correctly in the Active Directory LDAP panel, but failed during the authentication process for administrators, despite identical settings.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Authentication Method:** Active Directory (AD) LDAP

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the service account credentials and settings in the Active Directory LDAP panel.
2. Attempted to authenticate using the service account for administrator sync, which resulted in an error.
3. Suggested saving the AD configuration before testing the connection.
4. Scheduled a remote session for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the AD configuration not being saved prior to testing the connection for administrator sync. This led to the authentication failure.

## Solution
The resolution involved re-creating the Active Directory configuration and ensuring it was saved. After saving the configuration, the administrator sync was successfully completed.

## Notes
- Always ensure that any changes to the AD configuration are saved before testing connections to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist after saving, further investigation into the service account permissions and network connectivity may be necessary.
