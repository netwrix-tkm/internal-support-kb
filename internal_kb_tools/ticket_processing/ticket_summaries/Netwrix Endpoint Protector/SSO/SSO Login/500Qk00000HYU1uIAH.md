## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HYU1uIAH
- **Case Number:** 425203
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kaufland e-commerce
- **Contact Name:** Patrick Hannappel-Fechner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Patrick Hannappel-Fechner, reported an issue while testing Single Sign-On (SSO) in their Proof of Concept (POC). The test button used during the SSO configuration appeared to terminate the session, leaving the customer unable to access the non-SSO login URL. They requested the non-SSO fallback URL or assistance in deactivating SSO.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **SSO Configuration:** Attempted with Azure / Entra ID

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for the non-SSO fallback URL.
2. Checked the SSO configuration documentation provided by the customer.
3. Attempted to identify the non-SSO login URL based on the existing configuration.
4. Communicated with the customer to clarify their needs regarding SSO deactivation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the SSO test button terminating the session unexpectedly, which resulted in the customer being unable to access the application without SSO.

## Solution
The resolution involved resetting the SSO requirement for the customer's account, which allowed them to regain access to the application without needing SSO. The customer was informed of this change and was able to proceed with their testing.

## Notes
- It is important to provide clear documentation on how to access the non-SSO fallback URL in future cases.
- Consider including a warning about the potential for session termination when using the SSO test button in the documentation.
- Ensure that detailed instructions for configuring Endpoint Protector with Azure / Entra ID for SSO are readily available to assist customers in similar situations.
