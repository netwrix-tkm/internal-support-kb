- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tata Consultancy Services
- **Contact Name:** Chirasmita Patra
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, represented by Chirasmita, was attempting to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for Entra (Azure AD SSO). After uploading the Wintel SSL certificate on the SSO page, they lost access to the server console.

## Environment Details
- **Server Address:** pwx598s.hosted.endpointprotector.com

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Support team contacted Chirasmita to gather more information.
2. Access to the hosted server was requested.
3. Upon receiving access, the support team removed the incorrect SSO settings.
4. The SSO settings were then recreated to restore functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration of the SSO settings after the SSL certificate was uploaded. This misconfiguration led to the server console becoming inaccessible.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Removing the incorrect SSO settings that were causing the access issue.
- Recreating the SSO settings correctly, which restored access to the server console.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSL certificates are correctly configured before uploading to avoid similar access issues.
- Always verify SSO settings after making changes to prevent loss of access to critical server components.
