- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SambaSafety

- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login

## Problem Description
The customer, Andy Anderson from SambaSafety, reported confusion regarding obtaining a certificate for the Admin UI URL of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The existing setup was redirecting to an IP address instead of the intended domain.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted on AWS.
- The issue was tested across multiple machines and browsers, including incognito mode.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided instructions to navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance to add an SSL certificate.
2. Suggested generating a .pem SSL Certificate (certificate.pem and key.pem) and pasting their content into the self-signing certificate tabs.
3. Confirmed the certificate installation but noted the UI was still redirecting to the IP address (https://10.3.4.139/index.php/) instead of the domain (https://epp.adtscore.net/index.php).
4. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.
5. Informed the customer to open port 62828 in AWS for the IP from which the support team would connect.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect SSO settings, which led to the application redirecting to the server's IP address instead of the configured domain.

## Solution
During the remote session, the SSO settings were updated, which resolved the redirection issue. After the update, the Admin UI correctly redirected to the intended domain URL.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSO settings are correctly configured to avoid similar redirection issues in the future.
- Always verify that necessary ports are open in AWS or any other hosting environment to facilitate remote support sessions.
