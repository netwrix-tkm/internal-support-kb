- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
- **Contact Name:** Shannon Johnston
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** 8.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested instructions for using a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider for administrator logins. They noted that the "Single Sign On" link, which should be located below the "System Licensing" section, was missing from their console.

## Environment Details
- SSO was disabled in the user interface (UI) prior to the resolution of the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the "Single Sign On" link was absent from the console.
2. Identified that SSO was disabled in the UI.
3. Engaged with the relevant support team (RS) to enable SSO from the backend.

## Root Cause
The absence of the "Single Sign On" link was due to SSO being disabled in the user interface, which prevented the customer from accessing the necessary functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling SSO from the backend, which restored the functionality and allowed the customer to utilize the SSO provider for administrator logins.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSO is enabled in the UI for future installations or configurations to prevent similar issues.
- Always verify the status of SSO settings when customers report missing features related to authentication.
