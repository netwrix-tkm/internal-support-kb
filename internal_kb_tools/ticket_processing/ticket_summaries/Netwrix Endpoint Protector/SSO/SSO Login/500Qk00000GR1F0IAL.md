## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GR1F0IAL
- **Case Number:** 422452
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Locus
- **Contact Name:** Sourabh Purohit
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SSO
- **Feature:** SSO Login
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the SSO integration of Netwrix Endpoint Protector with Okta. They attempted to modify the nginx configuration to open an additional port for dashboard access, which inadvertently affected the SSO integration.

## Environment Details
- **SSO Provider:** Okta
- **Web Server:** Nginx

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the nginx configuration changes made by the customer.
2. Attempted to revert the nginx configuration to its previous state to restore SSO functionality.
3. Verified the SSO integration settings within the Endpoint Protector and Okta.
4. Communicated with the customer to gather additional details regarding the changes made.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the modification of the nginx configuration, which disrupted the existing SSO integration with Okta. Opening a new port without proper configuration led to conflicts in the authentication process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reverting the nginx configuration to its original state, ensuring that the SSO integration with Okta was restored. The customer confirmed that the SSO functionality was working correctly after the changes were undone.

## Notes
- When modifying nginx configurations, ensure that any changes do not interfere with existing integrations, particularly SSO setups.
- It is advisable to document any configuration changes and have a rollback plan in case of issues.
- Future attempts to open additional ports should be tested in a staging environment before applying to production to avoid disruptions.
