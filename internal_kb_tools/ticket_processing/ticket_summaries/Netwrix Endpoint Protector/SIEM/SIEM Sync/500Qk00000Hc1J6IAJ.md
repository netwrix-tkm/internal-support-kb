## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hc1J6IAJ
- **Case Number:** 425375
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system stopped functioning after a migration process. Although the migration was completed successfully, the SIEM was unable to process logs.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 (new server)
- **EPP Version:** 5.8.1.0 (updated from 5.6.0.0 on the old server running Ubuntu 18.04)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that no firewall rules were blocking the connection from the GCP instance to the SIEM tool.
2. Conducted tests to confirm that test logs were being received by the SIEM directly.
3. Investigated the EPP logs to determine why they were not reaching the SIEM.
4. Reviewed the syslog configuration file on the server to ensure UI settings were correctly applied.
5. Conducted remote sessions to check connectivity and configuration settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as missing entries in the configuration file for the SIEM after the migration. This misconfiguration prevented the EPP logs from being sent to the SIEM.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the missing entries in the configuration file. This adjustment allowed the EPP logs to be successfully transmitted to the SIEM, restoring its functionality.

## Notes
- Ensure that all configuration files are thoroughly reviewed and validated after any migration to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to maintain a backup of configuration files before migration for quick restoration if needed.
