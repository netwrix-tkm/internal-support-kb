## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NRmWNIA1
- **Case Number:** 440378
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Socure
- **Contact Name:** Shaun Khublall
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Client: 3.0.2.1007, Server: 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer's Endpoint Protector (EPP) instance was not sending logs to their SIEM (Sumo Logic). Despite having active alerts within EPP, no corresponding log entries were visible in the SIEM for the past 30 days.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Configuration:** SIEM integration feature enabled.
- **Server IP and Security Token:** Matched with Sumo Logic collector settings.
- **Platform:** AWS Customer Side.
- **OS Version:** Ubuntu (assumed).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the SIEM integration feature was enabled in EPP.
2. Verified that the Server IP and Security Token values in EPP matched those in Sumo Logic.
3. Checked for active alerts in EPP that should have triggered log generation.
4. Inquired about the type of syslog expected by Sumo Logic (initially reported as rsyslog).
5. Recommended switching from rsyslog to syslog-ng based on updated guidance.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a configuration mismatch regarding the syslog type. The customer was using rsyslog, which was not supported; the correct configuration should have been syslog-ng.

## Solution
The customer was advised to change the syslog type in their Sumo Logic configuration from rsyslog to syslog-ng. This change was expected to resolve the log transmission issue. The ticket was closed with the understanding that the customer would review their syslog settings and re-open the ticket if further assistance was needed.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the supported syslog types for integration with Sumo Logic.
- Recommend verifying all configuration settings in both EPP and the SIEM environment before escalating issues.
- The ticket can be re-opened within 30 days if further assistance is required.
