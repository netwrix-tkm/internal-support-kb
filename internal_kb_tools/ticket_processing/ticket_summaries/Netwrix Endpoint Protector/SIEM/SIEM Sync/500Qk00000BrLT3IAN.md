- **Case Number:** 412022
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TrueAccord
- **Contact Name:** Chris Moody
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue accessing the EPP DLP server on an AWS EC2 instance due to a missing key pair, which prevented troubleshooting and remote access.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** AWS EC2
- **Agent:** Sumo Logic collector agent deployed for log forwarding to SIEM server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the absence of the assigned key pair for SSH access to the EPP server.
2. Inquired internally about the deployment method of the EPP server and the installation of the Sumo Logic agent.
3. Suggested setting up a remote session to access the server backend for troubleshooting.
4. Discussed the possibility of initiating SSH access procedures if the customer did not have access.
5. Scheduled a remote session to restart the log forwarder and re-establish log ingestion from the EPP server to the SIEM.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of the SSH key pair necessary for accessing the EPP server, which was deployed as an AMI by a company representative without providing SSH access.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Gaining access to the backend of the EPP server through a remote session.
- Testing the Sumo Logic connection to ensure proper log forwarding to the SIEM server.
- The customer was advised to monitor the connection as it involved a relay between the EPP server and their Sumo Logic server.

## Notes
- Customers typically do not receive SSH access unless a waiver is signed.
- It is advisable to create a snapshot of the instance before performing any remote sessions to ensure data safety.
- Future deployments should ensure that key pairs are properly assigned and documented to avoid similar access issues.
