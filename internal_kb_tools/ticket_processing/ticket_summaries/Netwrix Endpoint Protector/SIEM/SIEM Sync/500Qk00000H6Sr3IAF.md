## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H6Sr3IAF
- **Case Number:** 424080
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Squalio Latvia
- **Contact Name:** Toms Vesperis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** 5940

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading their Netwrix Endpoint Protector server to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS in March 2024, the system stopped sending logs to the FortiSIEM Collector. Despite all necessary ports being open, there was no connection observed in the firewall logs.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- **Integration:** FortiSIEM Collector
- **Previous Configuration:** Log sending was functioning correctly prior to the upgrade.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed firewall logs to check for any connections (allowed or blocked) from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server to the FortiSIEM Collector.
2. Confirmed that all necessary ports were open between the two servers.
3. Attempted to recreate the SIEM integration setup without success.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not explicitly identified; however, it was likely related to the configuration settings being disrupted during the upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by saving the SIEM configuration again within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. This action re-established the connection and allowed logs to be sent to the FortiSIEM Collector successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure to verify configuration settings after any major system upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Regularly check firewall settings and connectivity between integrated systems to ensure proper log transmission.
