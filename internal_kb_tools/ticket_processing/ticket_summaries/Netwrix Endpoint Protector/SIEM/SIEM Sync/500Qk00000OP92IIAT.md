## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OP92IIAT
- **Case Number:** 443072
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrivatBank
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
After migrating the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server using System Backup v2, logs from the EPP stopped being sent to the customer's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, despite the integration settings remaining unchanged.

## Environment Details
- The new EPP server retained the same IP address as the old server.
- The old server was terminated after the migration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that logs were not being sent to the SIEM server.
2. Verified that the new server had the same IP address as the previous server.
3. Checked the connection to/from the EPP server.
4. Ensured all settings were migrated successfully.
5. Set the `support_syslogng` parameter to 1.
6. Conducted a `tcpdump` to monitor traffic.
7. Performed `ping` and `telnet` tests, which were successful.
8. Observed that logs started being sent to Qradar after the above steps.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the configuration of the syslog service on the new EPP server. Setting `support_syslogng` to 1 enabled the proper logging functionality required for sending logs to the SIEM.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Setting the `support_syslogng` parameter to 1, which allowed the logs to be sent to the SIEM server successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that a snapshot of the Endpoint Protector appliance is prepared before making backend changes, as this serves as a safety measure for reverting to previous settings if necessary.
- Always verify the configuration settings after a server migration, even if the settings appear unchanged.
