## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DsLBJIA3
- **Case Number:** 416850
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Joby Aviation
- **Contact Name:** Vatsal Gupta
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to receive any logs from the Endpoint Protector (EPP) on their AWS server. Despite the EPP server establishing a connection, no logs were being transmitted over the designated port (6514) to the rsyslog server.

## Environment Details
- **Server Type:** AWS
- **Log Transmission Protocol:** Rsyslog
- **Port Used for Logs:** 6514

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the connection status using the `netstat` command, confirming that the EPP server was attempting to connect.
2. Checked the configuration settings for the rsyslog server to ensure it was set up to receive logs on port 6514.
3. Reviewed firewall settings to ensure that port 6514 was open and not being blocked.
4. Confirmed that the EPP server was configured correctly to send logs to the rsyslog server.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the rsyslog server settings, which prevented it from properly receiving logs over port 6514.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correcting the configuration settings on the rsyslog server to ensure it was properly set up to receive logs from the EPP server. This included verifying the port settings and ensuring that the necessary permissions were in place.

## Notes
- Ensure that the rsyslog server is correctly configured to receive logs on the specified port to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check firewall settings to confirm that the required ports are open for communication between servers.
- Document any changes made to server configurations for future reference and troubleshooting.
