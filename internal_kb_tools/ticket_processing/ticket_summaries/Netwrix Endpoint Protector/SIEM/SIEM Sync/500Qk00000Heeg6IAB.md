## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the Public IP addresses used by Netwrix Endpoint Protector for SIEM integration. They needed a complete list of Public IPs for whitelisting on their side to ensure smooth operation of the SIEM integration.

## Environment Details
- The customer had previously whitelisted only one IP address (108.137.105.248) but discovered additional IPs (198.199.98.246) that also required whitelisting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's inquiry regarding the Public IPs for SIEM integration.
2. Confirmed the two IP addresses identified by the customer.
3. Provided the customer with the complete list of Public IPs used by Netwrix Endpoint Protector for SIEM integration.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer not having the complete list of Public IP addresses required for whitelisting, which led to potential connectivity issues with the SIEM integration.

The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the complete list of Public IP addresses used by Netwrix Endpoint Protector for SIEM integration, ensuring they could whitelist all necessary IPs for proper functionality.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to have the complete list of Public IPs for any integrations to avoid connectivity issues.
- Future inquiries regarding IP whitelisting should include a request for the complete list of IPs to ensure all necessary addresses are accounted for.
