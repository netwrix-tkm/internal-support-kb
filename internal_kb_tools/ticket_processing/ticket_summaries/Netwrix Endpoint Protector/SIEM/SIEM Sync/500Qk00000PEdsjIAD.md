## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000PEdsjIAD
- **Case Number:** 445366
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Laykon Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Faruk SarÄ±
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether it is possible to send SIEM logs in JSON format instead of CEF using Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They were informed that this could potentially be achieved through a feature called Unify, which was rumored to support API integration.

## Environment Details
- The current version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector supports SIEM log integration only in syslog format.
- JSON output is not available at this time.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that Netwrix Endpoint Protector currently supports SIEM log integration only in syslog format.
2. Verified that there is no current support for sending SIEM logs in JSON format directly from Endpoint Protector.
3. Reviewed the product roadmap for future enhancements, including API integration.
4. Provided links to the product roadmap and the Netwrix Ideas Portal for feature requests.
5. Engaged a product specialist to gather more information about Endpoint Protector Unify.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the customer's inquiry was the misunderstanding regarding the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector and the status of the Unify feature, which has been officially sunset and is no longer under active development.

## Solution
The customer was informed that:
- Netwrix Endpoint Protector only supports SIEM log integration in syslog format and does not offer JSON output at this time.
- The Unify feature is no longer available for future sales or development.
- They were directed to the product roadmap and the Netwrix Ideas Portal for tracking planned enhancements and submitting feature requests.

The customer acknowledged the information provided and expressed understanding regarding the discontinuation of Unify, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly about the limitations of current features and the status of any previously mentioned capabilities that may no longer be available.
- Encourage customers to utilize the Netwrix Ideas Portal for submitting feature requests to ensure their needs are considered in future product developments.
