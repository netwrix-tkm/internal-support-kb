## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HsW7fIAF
- **Case Number:** 425980
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sonoma Biotherapeutics
- **Contact Name:** Taeyoung Goo
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Taeyoung Goo from Sonoma Biotherapeutics, inquired about the specific folder to which Netwrix forwards logs when configured to send them to a SIEM server. They had set up a SIEM server and were forwarding logs but needed clarification on the log storage location.

## Environment Details
- **SIEM Server:** Built on Azure VM (Ubuntu 24.04) using Rsyslog.
- **Network Configuration:** Inbound port 514 TCP opened for log forwarding.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial response provided guidance to check the location settings on the customer's SIEM solution.
2. Customer shared their configuration settings for the Rsyslog server and requested feedback.
3. Support suggested modifying the setup to use syslog-ng instead of Rsyslog, as the EPP server was compatible with syslog-ng.
4. Customer attempted to switch from Rsyslog to syslog-ng but encountered issues starting the syslog-ng service.
5. Support offered to conduct a remote session to verify communication between the EPP server and the SIEM server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's initial configuration using Rsyslog, which was not compatible with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's logging requirements. The support team identified that the EPP server was designed to work with syslog-ng, leading to the recommendation for the customer to switch.

## Solution
The customer was advised to switch from Rsyslog to syslog-ng for log forwarding. After confirming the correct configuration and ensuring that the EPP server was communicating properly with the SIEM server, the customer confirmed that the issue was resolved and requested to close the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to verify compatibility between their logging solutions and the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- Future inquiries regarding log forwarding should include details about the logging server configuration and any network settings to expedite troubleshooting.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need to check their SIEM solution's settings for proper log storage configuration.
