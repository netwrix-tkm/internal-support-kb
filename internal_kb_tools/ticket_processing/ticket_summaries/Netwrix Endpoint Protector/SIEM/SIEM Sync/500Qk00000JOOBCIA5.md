- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync

## Problem Description
The customer reported that logs from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) were not being sent to their SIEM, QRadar. The SIEM integration was confirmed to be toggled on, and no changes had been made to the configuration prior to the issue arising.

## Environment Details
- **SIEM:** QRadar
- **Integration Status:** Toggled on

1. Confirmed that the SIEM integration was toggled on.
2. Attempted to toggle the SIEM integration off and back on without any improvement.
3. Escalated the issue and forwarded results to the engineering team in a Word file.
4. Waited for further instructions from R&D.
5. Suggested various troubleshooting steps, including:
   - Restarting the syslog-ng service.
   - Checking the TLS listener settings.
   - Verifying the configuration files in `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/`.
   - Ensuring the correct IP and port were being used for log transmission.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being on the customer's side; they were sending logs to the incorrect address.

## Solution
The customer corrected the log transmission address, which resolved the issue. After this adjustment, logs began to flow correctly to the SIEM.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct log transmission address is configured in the EPP settings to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to verify the configuration after any changes to the environment or integration settings to prevent disruptions in log transmission.
