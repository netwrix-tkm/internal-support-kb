## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fod3xIAB
- **Case Number:** 421102
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Laykon Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Faruk SarÄ±
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** SIEM
- **Feature:** SIEM Sync
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Wazuh SIEM integration, stating that although the integration was completed in the Appliance settings, logs were not being sent to the SIEM.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings in the Appliance -> SIEM Integration section.
2. Checked network connectivity to ensure that the SIEM server was reachable.
3. Reviewed firewall settings to identify any potential blocks on the required ports.
4. Confirmed that the Wazuh agent was running and properly configured to send logs.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the customer's network blocking traffic on port 514, which is required for log transmission to the SIEM.

## Solution
The resolution involved advising the customer to adjust their network firewall settings to allow traffic on port 514. Once the port was opened, logs began to flow to the SIEM as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that port 514 is open for traffic in any future SIEM integrations to prevent similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to conduct a network audit to confirm that all necessary ports are open and properly configured for log transmission.
