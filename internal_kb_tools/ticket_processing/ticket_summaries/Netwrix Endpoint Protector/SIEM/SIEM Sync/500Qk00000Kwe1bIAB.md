## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to see logs from their EPP server on the SIEM collector. They were unsure how to troubleshoot the issue further and mentioned missing SSH credentials to access the Ubuntu server.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted on an on-premise server in Azure.
- The logs were being sent in the syslog-ng format, while the SIEM collector was expecting the rsyslog format.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer was not receiving any logs in the SIEM server.
2. Identified that the logs were being sent in syslog-ng format.
3. Suggested the customer configure the SIEM server to accept syslog-ng format logs.
4. Awaited feedback from the customer regarding the configuration changes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch in the log formats. The EPP server was sending logs in syslog-ng format, while the SIEM collector was configured to expect rsyslog format logs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to configure their SIEM server to accept logs in syslog-ng format. Once the configuration was updated, the customer was able to receive logs successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the log format expected by the SIEM collector matches the format being sent by the EPP server to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to have access credentials for the server to facilitate troubleshooting and configuration changes.
