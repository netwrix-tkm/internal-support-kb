## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with gathering logs for their policies related to E-discovery and content-aware protection, as they needed to create digestible reports from this data.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific policies in question are related to E-discovery and content-aware protection (CAP).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Guided the customer on how to access the logs generated by CAP policies and E-discovery scans.
2. Increased the number of displayed log records from 200 to 5000 to facilitate better visibility and reporting.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's unfamiliarity with accessing and interpreting the logs generated by the policies they had implemented. There was also a limitation in the number of records displayed by default, which hindered their ability to gather comprehensive data.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with instructions on where to find the logs and increasing the display limit of log records. This allowed the customer to view a larger dataset, making it easier to compile the necessary reports.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of how to access logs and adjust display settings for better data visibility.
- Consider providing documentation or training resources for customers to help them understand log gathering and reporting processes more effectively.
