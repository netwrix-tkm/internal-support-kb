## Problem Description
The customer reported that the file shadow feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector was unable to create files with `.doc` and `.docx` extensions.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The specific feature involved was the Allowlist / Denylist functionality.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings for the file shadow feature.
2. Checked the allowlist and denylist entries to ensure that `.doc` and `.docx` extensions were not inadvertently blocked.
3. Reviewed logs for any error messages or warnings related to file creation.
4. Conducted tests to create files with other extensions to confirm that the issue was isolated to `.doc` and `.docx`.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the file repository settings, which inadvertently restricted the creation of files with `.doc` and `.docx` extensions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the file repository settings to allow the creation of `.doc` and `.docx` files. This involved:
- Updating the allowlist to include the necessary file extensions.
- Ensuring that no conflicting denylist entries were present.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review allowlist and denylist configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to check file repository settings if they encounter issues with specific file types not being created or accessed.
