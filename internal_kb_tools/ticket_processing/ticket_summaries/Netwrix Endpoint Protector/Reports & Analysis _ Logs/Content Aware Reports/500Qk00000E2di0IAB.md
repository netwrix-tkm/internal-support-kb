## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2di0IAB
- **Case Number:** 417122
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Black Sesame Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Kurt Fan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Reports & Analysis / Logs
- **Feature:** Content Aware Reports
- **Version:** 5.9.5.0 (fix targeted for this version)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite having Data Loss Prevention (DLP) enabled, they were unable to see destination details for files uploaded. The system was expected to provide visibility into where files were being uploaded, but this information was missing.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with DLP features enabled.
- Reporting V2 was initially disabled, which contributed to the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs from the customer's system for analysis.
2. Enabled Reporting V2 as suggested by the R&D team.
3. Noted that enabling Reporting V2 improved visibility slightly but did not resolve the issue completely, as some entries still lacked destination details.
4. Reported findings to R&D, who indicated that monitoring text/plain files could lead to false positives.
5. Informed the customer about the expected fix in version 5.9.5.0.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the monitoring of text/plain files, which resulted in numerous false positives and obscured the actual destination details. Additionally, the Reporting V2 feature was not initially enabled, which limited the visibility of destination details.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Enabling Reporting V2, which allowed for improved reporting capabilities.
- Informing the customer that a fix for the false positives related to text/plain file monitoring would be included in the upcoming server version 5.9.5.0.
- The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any further issues after the update.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that Reporting V2 is enabled for accurate reporting of destination details.
- Monitoring text/plain files should be approached with caution, as it may lead to false positives.
- For older logs, destination details may not be available once Reporting V2 is enabled; only new logs will reflect the changes.
