- **Case Number:** 430871
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kepsure Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Dharmik Bhayani
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Reports & Analysis / Logs
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they have enabled shadow copy for email and browsers and are receiving logs. However, they do not want logs from their domain, novasolingredients.com, and inquired if it is possible to exclude this domain from logging in Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector with shadow copy enabled for email and browsers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to review the configurations of the Content Aware Policy and Deep Packet Inspection settings.
2. Tested the logging behavior with the current configurations.
3. Verified that internal email domains added to the Allowedlist did not generate event logs under a Report Only CAP policy.
4. Confirmed that content sent to other email domains was reported as expected.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a malfunction of the Endpoint Protector system; rather, it was a misunderstanding of how the logging and Allowedlist functionalities work. The system operates as designed, where domains on the Allowedlist do not generate logs.

## Solution
The case was resolved by confirming that Endpoint Protector functions as intended. The customer was informed that to exclude logs from a specific domain, that domain must be added to the Allowedlist. Since the system was working correctly, the case was closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers understand the functionality of the Allowedlist in Endpoint Protector to prevent similar inquiries in the future.
- It is important to communicate clearly that domains must be explicitly added to the Allowedlist to avoid logging events related to those domains.
