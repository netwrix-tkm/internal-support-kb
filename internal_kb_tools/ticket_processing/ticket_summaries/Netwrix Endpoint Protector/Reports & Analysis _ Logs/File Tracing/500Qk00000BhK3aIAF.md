- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dreamplug Technologies Private Limited
- **Contact Name:** Sherla Vamshi Krishna
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Reports & Analysis / Logs
- **Feature:** File Tracing
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in identifying which files were being shared from their laptops and whether those documents could be downloaded.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Mac laptops, while the documentation referenced features available for Windows systems.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Advised the customer that user activity could be viewed in the Reports and Analysis - File Tracing tab.
2. Confirmed that documents themselves could not be downloaded.
3. Provided a link to the user manual for further reference, specifically chapter 5.7.3.
4. Clarified the availability of the File Tracing feature on Mac systems.
5. Discussed the possibility of file shadowing and its implications for document accessibility.

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from the customer's expectation that files could be downloaded directly from the File Tracing feature, which is not supported. Additionally, the documentation primarily addressed Windows systems, leading to uncertainty regarding Mac compatibility.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Confirming that the File Tracing feature is available for Mac systems, but with limitations on downloading files.
- Explaining that if file shadowing is enabled, a small copy of the document may be generated on the server, but it is not a direct copy and may not be accessible in the same manner as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to customers that the ability to download documents directly from the File Tracing feature is not available.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the differences in functionality between Windows and Mac systems regarding the Netwrix Endpoint Protector features.
- Future communications should emphasize checking the user manual for specific feature details and limitations.
