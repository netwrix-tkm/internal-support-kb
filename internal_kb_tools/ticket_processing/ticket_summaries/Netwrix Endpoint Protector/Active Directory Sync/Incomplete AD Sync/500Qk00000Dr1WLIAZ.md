## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Dr1WLIAZ
- **Case Number:** 416759
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liebherr
- **Contact Name:** Markus Grasbon
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** Incomplete AD Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue during the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically with the Active Directory (AD) synchronization. Although the AD sync setup was successful and groups and users were created in Endpoint Protector, the user-group associations appeared random and incorrect.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue occurred during the AD synchronization process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the connection to the Domain Controller (DC) was successful.
2. Checked the logs to confirm that groups and users were being created as expected.
3. Randomly selected 10 users to verify their group memberships, which appeared incorrect.
4. Deleted the existing AD connector and all users and groups in Endpoint Protector.
5. Reconfigured the AD sync and waited for the synchronization to complete.
6. Repeated the verification of user-group associations, which still appeared random.
7. Consulted with a technical expert (Andreas Zetea-Ster) who could not identify the root cause.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. The behavior of random user-group associations persisted despite multiple attempts to reconfigure the AD sync.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer confirmed that the problem had been addressed. Specific details on the resolution were not provided, but it is implied that further adjustments or updates to the Endpoint Protector may have rectified the synchronization issue.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the AD sync configuration is thoroughly reviewed and validated during setup.
- Future cases involving random user-group associations should consider potential issues with the AD connector configuration or the synchronization process itself.
- Regular updates and checks on the Endpoint Protector may help prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
