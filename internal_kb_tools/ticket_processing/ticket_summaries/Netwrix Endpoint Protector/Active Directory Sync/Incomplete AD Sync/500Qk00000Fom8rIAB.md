## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fom8rIAB
- **Case Number:** 421106
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IHK Region Stuttgart
- **Contact Name:** Florian Bartl
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** Incomplete AD Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that while user data is correctly transferred from Active Directory (AD) to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) during synchronization, if the user data is deleted from the EPP web interface, it does not get re-transferred upon initiating another AD sync.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Sync Source:** Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that user data was being correctly transferred from AD to EPP during initial sync.
2. Attempted to delete user data from the EPP web interface and re-initiated the AD sync.
3. Checked for any error messages or logs during the sync process.
4. Reviewed previous cases related to AD sync issues, particularly concerning system administrators.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure in the synchronization process where deleted users in the EPP were not being re-imported from the AD during subsequent syncs. This behavior was consistent with a previously reported issue regarding AD sync for system administrators.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by recovering the normal users that had been deleted from the EPP. This allowed the synchronization process to function correctly, ensuring that user data from AD was re-imported into the EPP as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any deletions in the EPP are followed by a thorough check of the sync settings and logs to confirm that the expected behavior is occurring.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should be advised to check for any existing cases related to incomplete AD syncs, as there may be underlying patterns or solutions that can be applied.
