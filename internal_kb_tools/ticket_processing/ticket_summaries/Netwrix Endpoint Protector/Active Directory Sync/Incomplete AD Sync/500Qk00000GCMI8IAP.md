## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GCMI8IAP
- **Case Number:** 421965
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Profertil - Argentina
- **Contact Name:** Pablo Tizon
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** Incomplete AD Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that local users created in the Netwrix appliance were unable to reset their passwords due to the absence of an "old password." This issue arose because the users were authenticated through Active Directory (AD) sync, which did not provide a mechanism for password resets.

## Environment Details
- The appliance was configured to sync users from Active Directory.
- Password expiration settings were initially set to 30 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the password expiration settings and confirmed they were set to expire every 30 days.
2. Identified that users synced from AD were being prompted for password changes despite not having local passwords.
3. Suggested changing the password expiration setting to "never expire" for the affected users.
4. Awaited customer approval for the proposed change and monitored the situation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the password expiration policy set on the appliance, which conflicted with the AD sync configuration. Users synced from AD were treated as local accounts, leading to confusion regarding password resets.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the "ignore AD authentication" setting on the appliance. This change allowed the affected users to log into the console without being prompted for a password reset, as they were authenticated directly through AD.

## Notes
- It is recommended to set the password expiration policy to "never expire" for users synced from AD to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Monitor user accounts regularly to ensure that AD sync settings align with local account policies to avoid authentication conflicts.
