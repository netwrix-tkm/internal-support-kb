## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H4yv5IAB
- **Case Number:** 424022
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Joby Aero, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Vatsal Gupta
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** Incomplete AD Sync
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with Content Aware Alerts where groups were not syncing properly. Users in the groups were not being added when applying policies by group, specifically when using Entra.

## Environment Details
- The customer uses Entra for managing alerts.
- The issue was observed in the alerts section where only a few users were selected from the groups.
- The problem did not occur with Content Aware Policies, and local groups worked correctly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that users were correctly assigned to the groups in Active Directory.
2. Conducted tests with local groups, which worked as expected.
3. Held a remote session to gather MySQL data for two users.
4. Investigated MySQL connections with assistance from Augustina, confirming they were correct.
5. Replicated the issue internally and confirmed the same behavior.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the same user logging in from two different devices simultaneously (a Windows machine and a macOS machine). This led to conflicts in user verification when groups were selected in the policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the observed behavior was normal. The user was frequently switching between machines, which affected how the system verified their group membership based on the last seen timestamps of the devices.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor user login behavior, especially when users frequently switch between devices, as this can lead to unexpected results in group syncing.
- Future investigations should consider user device connectivity and session management to avoid similar issues.
