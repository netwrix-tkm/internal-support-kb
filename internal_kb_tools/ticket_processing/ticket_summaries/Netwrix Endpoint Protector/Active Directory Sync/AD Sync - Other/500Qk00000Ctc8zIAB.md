- **Case Number:** 414654
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** East Alabama Medical Center
- **Contact Name:** Lisa Countryman
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with stale devices in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) system. Despite removing unlicensed, offline, and deleted devices from Active Directory, these devices were reappearing in the EPP console, causing inaccuracies in reporting.

## Environment Details
- The sync with Azure Active Directory was set to occur every 15 minutes.
- The devices in question were confirmed to be no longer present in the organization or in Azure Active Directory.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed whether the EPP agent was uninstalled from the devices that were deleted from the console.
2. Investigated the "Last seen" column in the Device Control -> Computers section of the EPP console.
3. Checked the synchronization settings with Azure Active Directory.
4. Gathered information on the timing of the repopulation of stale devices after sync events.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of an outdated server version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The server was not properly handling the removal of devices from the EPP console, leading to stale devices being repopulated during synchronization.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by upgrading the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server to the latest version and applying the necessary hotfixes. This update ensured that the synchronization process correctly reflected the current state of devices in Active Directory.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP agent is uninstalled from any devices that are removed from the console to prevent future repopulation issues.
- Regularly check for updates and apply hotfixes to the server to maintain optimal functionality and prevent similar issues.
- Monitor the synchronization settings and results to ensure that stale devices do not reappear unexpectedly.
