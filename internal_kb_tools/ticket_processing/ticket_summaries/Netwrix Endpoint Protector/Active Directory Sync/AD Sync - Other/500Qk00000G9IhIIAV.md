## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G9IhIIAV
- **Case Number:** 421839
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HDR
- **Contact Name:** Michael Block
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync - Other
- **Version:** 1.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where user accounts that were manually created in EPP could not be re-added to the Active Directory (AD) group after being deleted. The synchronization process failed to recreate these accounts if they had the same name as previously deleted accounts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Sync Method:** Active Directory Sync

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the status of user accounts in the database.
2. Checked for any existing entries in the `sf_guard_user` table marked as deleted.
3. Executed the following SQL commands in the MySQL database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sf_guard_user WHERE deleted = 1;
   DELETE FROM sf_guard_user WHERE deleted = 1;
   ```
4. Restarted the MySQL service.
5. Attempted to sync AD Administrators from System Settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the presence of database entries for user accounts that were marked as deleted but still retained the same names as the new accounts being added. This prevented the synchronization process from successfully re-adding the accounts.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by executing SQL commands to delete the entries of the deleted user accounts from the `sf_guard_user` table in the MySQL database. After clearing these entries, the MySQL service was restarted, and the AD synchronization was performed successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that any user accounts that are deleted in EPP are also cleared from the database to avoid conflicts during synchronization.
- Regularly monitor the `sf_guard_user` table for any entries marked as deleted to prevent similar issues in the future.
