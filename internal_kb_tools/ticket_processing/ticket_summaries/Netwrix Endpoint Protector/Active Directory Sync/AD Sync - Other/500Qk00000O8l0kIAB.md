- **Case Number:** 442349
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AconSeg
- **Contact Name:** Jonatan Pregliasco
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the synchronization of Active Directory (AD) administrators. Initially, the system successfully imported the designated AD admins. However, after adding new members to the AD Admin Group and attempting to synchronize again, the new admins did not appear in the "System Administrators" section, despite receiving a confirmation message stating "AD administrators have been synchronized!"

## Environment Details
- The system is integrated with Active Directory for user management.
- The synchronization process is managed through the "System Settings - Active Directory Authentication" interface.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the initial successful synchronization of AD admins.
2. Verified that new users were added to the designated AD Admin Group.
3. Attempted to synchronize AD administrators again using the "Syn AD Administrator" option.
4. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by duplicate admin entries in the database, which prevented the new administrators from being displayed in the "System Administrators" section.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by removing the duplicate admin entries from the database. After this cleanup, the synchronization process successfully imported the new AD administrators, and they appeared correctly in the "System Administrators" section.

## Notes
- Ensure to regularly check for duplicate entries in the database when managing AD synchronization to prevent similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to implement a validation step during the synchronization process to alert users of potential duplicates before the sync is completed.
