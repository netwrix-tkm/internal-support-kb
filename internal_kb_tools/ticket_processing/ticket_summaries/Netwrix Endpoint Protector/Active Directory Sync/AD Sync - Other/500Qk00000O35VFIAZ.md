- **Case Number:** 442009
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ropes and Gray LLC
- **Contact Name:** Matt Joyce
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4

## Problem Description
The customer, Matt Joyce from Ropes and Gray LLC, reported an issue with syncing a newly created Microsoft Active Directory (AD) group named "CIGWL Information Governance Watchlist" into the Device Control groups of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The customer needed to set access restrictions on devices based on this group.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Directory Service:** Microsoft Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested a remote session to investigate the issue further.
2. During the remote session, deleted the initial AD sync configuration.
3. Created a new AD sync configuration to ensure proper syncing of the group.
4. Verified the status of the new sync job to confirm it completed successfully.

## Root Cause
The initial AD sync configuration was likely misconfigured or incomplete, preventing the newly created group from appearing in the Device Control groups.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting the initial AD sync configuration.
- Creating a new AD sync configuration, which successfully synced the "CIGWL Information Governance Watchlist" group into the Device Control groups, allowing the customer to set access restrictions on devices as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure that any new AD groups are properly synced by verifying the sync job status after creation.
- If issues persist with group syncing, consider deleting and recreating the sync configuration as a potential solution.
- Future users should check the documentation provided in the support ticket for guidance on setting up Directory Services and AD sync configurations.
