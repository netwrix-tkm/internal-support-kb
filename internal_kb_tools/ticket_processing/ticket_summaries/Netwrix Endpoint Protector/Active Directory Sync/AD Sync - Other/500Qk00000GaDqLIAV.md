- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync - Other

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in setting up an SSL certificate for agent server communication and web server communication using Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). They reported that there was no option to request a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was using Active Directory for certificate management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team confirmed that the generation of certificates and keys is outside the scope of their support.
2. The customer was informed that they could only import existing certificates and keys into the DLP server.
3. Follow-up communications were made to check if the customer still required assistance or if the issue had been resolved.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding SSL certificate management. The support team clarified that the generation of CSRs and private keys is not supported by their service.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with clear guidance that:
- The generation of SSL certificates and private keys must be handled outside of the Netwrix support scope.
- The customer should generate the CSR and private key using their own tools or processes before importing the certificate into the DLP server.

## Notes
- Customers should be made aware that the generation of SSL certificates and keys is not supported by Netwrix and must be done independently.
- It is advisable to provide documentation or links to resources on how to generate CSRs and manage SSL certificates for future reference.
