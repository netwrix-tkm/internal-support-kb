## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LaG5QIAV
- **Case Number:** 435014
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Mississippi Medical Center
- **Contact Name:** Jack S
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after importing a list of system admin accounts from Active Directory (AD), the passwords for these linked admin accounts do not sync when the admins change their passwords in AD. The customer inquired whether it would be easier to delete the broken AD linked accounts and set up Azure Single Sign-On (SSO) instead.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the integration of Active Directory with Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer expressed interest in utilizing Azure SSO as an alternative solution.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the AD linked accounts in Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
2. Confirmed that password synchronization settings were correctly configured.
3. Explored the possibility of using Azure SSO as a workaround for the password sync issue.
4. Discussed the implications of deleting the broken AD linked accounts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the synchronization process between Active Directory and Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically regarding password updates for linked accounts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by configuring OKTA SSO for the customer, which provided a functional alternative to the problematic AD linked accounts. This allowed for seamless authentication without the need for password synchronization.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the integration between Active Directory and Netwrix Endpoint Protector for any future synchronization issues.
- Consider implementing Azure SSO or OKTA SSO for environments where password synchronization is critical and problematic.
- Ensure that all relevant documentation is updated to reflect the new SSO configuration for future reference.
