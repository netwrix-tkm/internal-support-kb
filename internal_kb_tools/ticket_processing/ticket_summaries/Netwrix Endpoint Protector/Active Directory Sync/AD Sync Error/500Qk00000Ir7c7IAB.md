## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ir7c7IAB
- **Case Number:** 428332
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Delta Sucroenergia
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync Error
- **Version:** 13.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that two admin users from the admin group synced with Endpoint Protector (EPP) still appeared as User Type: EPP instead of Active Directory (AD) users. Consequently, these users were unable to log in using their AD passwords.

## Environment Details
- The server hosting the application is managed by the customer.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial troubleshooting was performed by the partner, which did not resolve the issue.
2. Suggested to toggle the "ignore AD Authentication" setting on and off to see if it would allow the users to authenticate with their AD passwords.
3. If the above step failed, the next step was to SSH into the server, delete the problematic users from the database, and attempt the sync again after a reboot.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the users being created as EPP types prior to the AD sync. Once a user is created as an EPP type, it does not automatically change to the AD type after syncing, which caused the authentication issues.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
1. SSHing into the server.
2. Deleting the two problematic users from the database.
3. Rebooting the server.
4. Performing the AD sync again, which successfully brought in the correct user types from AD.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are not created as EPP types if they are intended to be AD users to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the server settings and user types before performing sync operations to prevent authentication problems.
