## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EW8iMIAT
- **Case Number:** 418324
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HEIN, LEHMANN GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Michael Hartlieb
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Active Directory Sync
- **Feature:** AD Sync Error
- **Version:** Ubuntu 22

## Problem Description
After migrating the backupV2 from Ubuntu 18 to Ubuntu 22, the connection to the local Active Directory (AD) failed. The new server was unable to sync with the AD, while the old server continued to function without issues.

## Environment Details
- **Old Server:** Ubuntu 18
- **New Server:** Ubuntu 22
- **Network Configuration:** vSphere network switched online/offline multiple times

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the old server (Ubuntu 18) could connect to the Active Directory without issues.
2. Attempted to connect the new server (Ubuntu 22) to the Active Directory.
3. Checked system logs on the new server for any relevant error messages (none found).
4. Reviewed Web UI error messages indicating failure to bind to Active Directory.
5. Attempted to use both the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and the IP address for the AD connection.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure to connect to the LDAP server due to incorrect port usage and possibly DNS resolution issues when using the FQDN.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Using port **389** for the LDAP connection.
- Connecting to the Active Directory using the **IP address** instead of the FQDN.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct port is used for LDAP connections in future migrations.
- If issues arise with FQDN resolution, consider using the IP address as a temporary workaround.
- Regularly check system logs for any connection-related errors during server migrations.
