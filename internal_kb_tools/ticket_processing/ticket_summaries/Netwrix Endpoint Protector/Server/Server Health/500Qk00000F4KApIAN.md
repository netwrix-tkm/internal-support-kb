## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space despite having cleared the logs. The disk space usage was still concerning after the logs were removed.

## Environment Details
- **Disk Space System:** 17G
- **Disk Space EPP Server:** 16G
- **Logs on Disk:** 4.0K
- **Shadows on Disk:** 168M

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer cleared the logs to free up disk space.
2. The customer checked the disk space usage, which still indicated low available space.
3. No additional troubleshooting steps were documented in the case.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was determined that the logs cleared did not significantly impact the overall disk space usage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing additional disk space on the appliance. Specific actions taken to clear disk space were not detailed, but it was confirmed that the disk space was successfully cleared.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly monitor disk space and perform maintenance to prevent low disk space issues.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should consider checking for other files or data that may be consuming disk space beyond logs and shadows.
