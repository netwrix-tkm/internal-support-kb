- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CeV2zIAF
- **Case Number:** 414020
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Comerica Bank
- **Contact Name:** Maria De La Garza
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
Comerica reported that the Content Aware Report was not ordered in descending order by the "Date/Time(Client)" column upon initial opening. Events from 7/2 appeared after events from 7/1, indicating a sorting issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in both the QA environment and the SE environment (8yx79ru.hosted.endpointprotector.com).
- The QA environment had been rolled back to a state prior to the first hotfix application, retaining only logs from before the first hotfix and after the second hotfix.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the sorting behavior of the "Date/Time(Client)" column in the Content Aware Report.
2. Checked the logs in the QA environment to confirm the rollback state and the absence of logs that could have been caught in the backend.
3. Monitored the issue over time to see if it would reoccur after the rollback.

## Root Cause
The issue was initially caused by rolling back a server version, which led to some events being displayed out of date. The rollback resulted in the logs not being processed correctly, affecting their order in the report.

## Solution
The issue did not reproduce after the rollback, and it was determined that the sorting issue was a temporary effect of the server rollback. The ticket was closed with the understanding that if the issue reoccurs, it can be reopened for further investigation.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the sorting behavior of reports after any server changes or rollbacks.
- If similar issues arise, check the server version and log processing status to ensure that all logs are being handled correctly.
- Sorting preferences in the report may not be saved if the user navigates away from the report tab, which could lead to confusion regarding the displayed order.
