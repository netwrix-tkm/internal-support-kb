- **Case Number:** 429032
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Haleon
- **Contact Name:** Erin Perkins
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when attempting to access the General dashboard or Device Control dashboard in Haleon's production environment, an "Oops an Error Occurred" message was displayed.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Affected Dashboards:** General Dashboard and Device Control Dashboard

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the existence and permissions of the `/EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/` directory.
2. Checked the ownership and permissions of the files within the dashboardData directory.
3. Ensured that the following files were present:
   - `capDashboard.json`
   - `eDiscoveryDashboard.json`
   - `dcDashboard.json`
4. If files were missing or permissions were incorrect, the following commands were executed:
   - `chmod 0755 /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData`
   - `chown www-data:www-data /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData`
5. If the issue persisted, the files were deleted from the `/EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/` directory.
6. Reran the cron job using:
   - `php /EPPServer/appliance/operations/prepareDcDashboard.php`

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by missing or improperly configured backend files necessary for the dashboards to function correctly. The cron jobs responsible for updating these files had not executed properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the existing files in the `/EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/` directory and rerunning the cron job to recreate the necessary files. After this action, the dashboards became accessible again without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that the cron jobs are running as scheduled to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the permissions and ownership of the dashboardData directory and its files to maintain proper functionality.
- Document any changes made to the environment for future reference and troubleshooting.
