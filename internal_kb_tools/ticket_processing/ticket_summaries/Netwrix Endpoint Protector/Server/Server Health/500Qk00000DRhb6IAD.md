- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Taft Stettinius & Hollister
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Lemieux
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Problem Description
The server was found to be in a crashed state after an upgrade to version 5.9.1.0 and the application of a hotfix for ADV-2024-002. It was failing to load the EPP web portal.

## Environment Details
- The server had recently undergone an upgrade and hotfix application.
- Console access revealed repeated error messages indicating issues with network connectivity.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Accessed the server console to check for error messages.
2. Noted the following repeated error messages:
   - `"cifs_mount failed w/return code = -2"`
   - `"Error connecting to socket. Aborting operation"`
3. Attempted to diagnose network adapter configurations.
4. Investigated the GRUB configuration for potential misconfigurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure related to the second network adapter, which had become disconnected, leading to network connectivity problems and the inability to load the EPP web portal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Reconnecting the second network adapter.
2. Reconfiguring the GRUB bootloader to ensure proper system startup and network initialization.

## Notes
- Ensure that all network adapters are properly connected and configured after server upgrades or hotfix applications.
- Monitor server health closely after applying updates to catch potential issues early.
- Document any changes made to network configurations for future reference.
