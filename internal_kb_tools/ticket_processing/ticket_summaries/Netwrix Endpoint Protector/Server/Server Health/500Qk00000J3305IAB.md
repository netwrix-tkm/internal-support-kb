## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the management console via a bookmarked URL. The URL had previously worked but suddenly stopped functioning.

## Environment Details
- **URL:** [https://41fir3s.hosted.endpointprotector.com/](https://41fir3s.hosted.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps

## Root Cause
The server did not pass health checks, which likely caused the management console to become inaccessible.
