## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the nginx webserver failed to start after adding a valid license via the GUI and restarting the system. The startup process displayed the message "[FAILED] Failed to start A high performance web server and reverse proxy server," resulting in the website being unreachable.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Server Type:** nginx webserver

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The client was contacted via email to schedule a remote session for further investigation.
2. Awaited the client's response regarding availability for the remote session.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the configuration file for nginx. Specifically, the `setup.nginx.conf` file was located in an incorrect directory, preventing the webserver from starting properly.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by moving the `setup.nginx.conf` file from its initial location to the correct directory. After this adjustment, the nginx webserver was able to start successfully, and the website became reachable.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `setup.nginx.conf` file is placed in the correct directory during installation or configuration to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify the configuration files after any updates or changes to the system to ensure that all services start correctly.
