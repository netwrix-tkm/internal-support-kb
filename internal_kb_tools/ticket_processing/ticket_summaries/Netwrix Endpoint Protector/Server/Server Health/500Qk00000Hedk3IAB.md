- **Case Number:** 425460
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hitachi Systems India Pvt. Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Divya Ramachandran S
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health

## Problem Description
The Cososys server was not syncing properly with the NTP (Network Time Protocol) server, leading to potential discrepancies in time-sensitive operations.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the Issue:** 6.2 days at the time of resolution

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The issue was reported by the customer, indicating that the server was not syncing with the NTP server.
2. The support team assigned the NTP to a different NTP server to resolve the syncing issue.
3. Follow-up communications confirmed that the date and time were in sync after the change.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was determined that the original NTP server was not functioning correctly, which led to the syncing issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reassigning the NTP settings to a different, functioning NTP server. This change allowed the Cososys server to sync correctly, as confirmed by subsequent checks.

## Notes
- Ensure that the NTP server being used is reliable and functioning correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular monitoring of server health and time synchronization can help preemptively identify and resolve such issues.
