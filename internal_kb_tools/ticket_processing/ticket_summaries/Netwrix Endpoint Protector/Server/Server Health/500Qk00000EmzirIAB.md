- **Case Number:** 418847
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Flywire
- **Contact Name:** Amro Zein
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health

## Problem Description
The customer reported persistent 5xx errors on their application, accompanied by slow loading times and unresponsive buttons. The application typically became responsive only after multiple refresh attempts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to check the MySQL version and ensure that partitions were activated.
2. Requested the customer to provide specific MySQL commands to gather information about the database setup:
   - `mysql -V`
   - `show create table cf_log;`
   - `show create table olog;`
3. Suggested reviewing log paths for each version to identify which patch might have caused the issue.
4. Recommended reverting the server to version 5.5.0.0 if a snapshot was available and applying patches one at a time while monitoring logs and UI functionality.
5. Provided new AMI images to the customer for deployment.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the 5xx errors and application slowness was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was suggested that issues related to MySQL configuration and partitioning could have contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by supplying the customer with new AMI images, which they successfully deployed. This action eliminated the errors and improved application performance.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the application closely after deploying new images or patches to ensure stability.
- Future cases involving similar 5xx errors should consider checking MySQL configurations and partitioning as potential factors.
- The customer ultimately decided to decommission the service, indicating a shift in their operational strategy.
