- **Case Number:** 434816
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech

- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their EPP server was displaying a warning indicating that the server's logs were full. Attempts to download older Audit Log Backup files were unsuccessful, as no activity occurred when the download was initiated. Additionally, the customer noted that their SFTP connectivity to the backup server was broken, preventing the transfer of audit log backup files.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server.
- The server was experiencing disk space issues due to full logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to guide the user to download older Audit Log Backup files.
2. Verified that no pop-up or activity occurred during the download attempt.
3. Confirmed that SFTP connectivity to the backup server was broken.
4. Scheduled a remote call with the user for further assistance.

## Root Cause
The disk space on the EPP server was occupied by "shadows," which are likely temporary files or backups that were not cleared. This accumulation of shadows contributed to the server's logs being full and the inability to download the audit log backup files.

## Solution
- The customer was instructed to copy all shadow files to their local computer.
- Once the shadows were copied, the support team deleted the shadows from the server, which cleared up the disk space.
- The "Restored External Storage" option was also utilized to manage the storage effectively.

## Notes
- Ensure that SFTP connectivity is regularly monitored to prevent similar issues with backup file transfers.
- Advise customers to periodically check and manage disk space on their EPP servers to avoid log overflow.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup processes for shadows or temporary files to maintain optimal server performance.
