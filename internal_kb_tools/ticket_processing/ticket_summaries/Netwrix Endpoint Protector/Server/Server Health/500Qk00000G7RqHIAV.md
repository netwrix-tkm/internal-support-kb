- **Case Number:** 421738
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Swiggy
- **Contact Name:** Dhanush Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that there were over 10,000 machines listed as unlicensed or offline in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console. They requested assistance to validate and remove these machines from the console via backend operations.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer required backend SQL commands to delete unlicensed and offline machines without impacting the existing data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to understand the issue and gather requirements.
2. Suggested using the GUI to delete unlicensed and offline computers, but the customer insisted on backend operations.
3. Scheduled multiple remote sessions to run SQL commands for data cleanup.
4. Developed and tested SQL commands to mark unlicensed and offline machines as deleted.
5. Conducted remote sessions to execute the SQL commands and monitor the results.
6. Adjusted SQL commands based on feedback and results from previous attempts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the accumulation of unlicensed and offline machines in the console, which had not been cleaned up due to the lack of appropriate backend SQL commands to perform the deletions effectively.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing the following SQL command on the backend of the EPP Server Appliance:
```sql
UPDATE clientmachine SET deleted = 1 WHERE lastseen < '2024-06-01' AND lastseen IS NOT NULL AND (trialversion < 1 OR trialversion IS NULL) LIMIT 1000;
```
This command was run multiple times to ensure all relevant machines were marked as deleted. The backend cleanup was successfully completed, and no further response was received from the customer, leading to the closure of the case.

## Notes
- It is crucial to perform a backup of the current state of the Endpoint Protector appliance before executing any SQL commands to avoid data loss.
- Future cases involving large data cleanup should consider the performance implications of running multiple SQL commands and may require coordination with development teams for optimal command formulation.
- Ensure that the customer is aware of the potential impact of backend operations on their data and system performance.
