## Problem Description
The customer, Patric Schleicher, reported that they were unable to reach their server at the provided URL: [https://du13cnm.hosted.endpointprotector.com/](https://du13cnm.hosted.endpointprotector.com/). 

## Environment Details

- Reset the user's password to `epp2011`, allowing the customer to log in successfully.
