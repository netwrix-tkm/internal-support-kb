- **Case Number:** 414112
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** 1.1 (hotfix)

## Problem Description
The customer reported a suspected bug occurring after the application of a hotfix, which resulted in computers not communicating with the server.

## Environment Details
- The Endpoint Protector (EPP) is hosted on CoSoSys' side.
- The customer was experiencing connectivity issues, specifically error 504 (Bad Gateway).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the issue was made via email communication.
2. Suggested scheduling a remote session to check connectivity and collect logs.
3. Attempted to gather information about the server's IP address configuration on the agents.
4. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the connectivity issue.
5. Confirmed that agents can function even if they cannot connect to the server.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration of the server's IP address on the agents after the hotfix was applied. The agents were still pointing to the old server IP, which caused the communication failure.

## Solution
The resolution involved changing the server's IP address on the agents to the correct one. This adjustment restored communication between the computers and the server, resolving the connectivity issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that after applying any hotfix, the server's IP address is correctly configured on all agents to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify connectivity and configuration settings immediately after updates or changes to the system.
