## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Caz9OIAR
- **Case Number:** 413856
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston
- **Contact Name:** Joseph Valle
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Health
- **Feature:** Device Control
- **Version:** 5.8.1.0 (upgraded to 5.9.3.0 during resolution)

## Problem Description
The customer reported a low disk space warning when accessing the 'Devices' section under 'Device Control'. The interface became unresponsive, with the loading cursor spinning for an extended period before displaying the warning. Additionally, the customer expressed concerns regarding a recent vulnerability email and potential server updates.

## Environment Details
- The server was initially running version 5.8.1.0 of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The system drive was observed to be at 28% capacity, which increased to 78% after accessing the 'Devices' section.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the disk space issue by checking the server's capacity before and after accessing the 'Devices' section.
2. Suggested accessing the backend to identify what was consuming disk space.
3. Proposed clearing old patch files and backup files to free up space.
4. Discussed the upgrade process to version 5.9.3.0, which includes fixes for device duplication issues.
5. Gained permission from the customer to access the backend and perform necessary actions.
6. Initiated a remote session to assist with the upgrade and cleanup process.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by a large number of duplicate devices created by the Endpoint Protector server, which led to excessive disk space consumption and performance degradation when accessing the 'Devices' section.

## Solution
- Cleared disk space by removing unnecessary old patch files and backup files from the backend.
- Upgraded the server from version 5.8.1.0 to 5.9.3.0 to address the device duplication issue.
- After the upgrade, the customer was able to access the console without issues.

## Notes
- It is crucial to monitor disk space regularly, especially when many devices are managed.
- Ensure that the server is updated to the latest version to benefit from fixes and improvements.
- If the console becomes unresponsive, check for duplicate devices and consider a server reboot if necessary.
- The agents will continue to function even if the console is unresponsive, but rule changes cannot be made until access is restored.
