## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KQXJUIA5
- **Case Number:** 431640
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cheyenne Regional Medical Center (CRMC)
- **Contact Name:** Aaron Loken
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple issues with their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server:
- The server was unable to retrieve the latest updates.
- The Logs Report page was timing out and not loading.
- Manual Audit Log backups were running for an extended period without producing any logs, indicating a potential failure in the backup process.

## Environment Details
- The server is running on MySQL and Ubuntu, specific versions were collected during troubleshooting sessions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to gather necessary information for R&D escalation.
2. Received initial feedback from R&D and scheduled follow-up remote sessions.
3. Addressed the Logs Report page issue during a remote session, which was resolved by applying backend procedures provided by R&D.
4. Collected additional logs and query outputs related to the Audit Log Backup issue for further investigation by R&D.
5. Gathered MySQL and Ubuntu versions, along with the structure of relevant tables (olog, ofiletrace, cf_log, cf_log_details, dr_object).
6. R&D provided a database script and steps for creating partitions, which were implemented during a subsequent remote session.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issues was identified as the lack of proper partitioning in the database tables (specifically the `olog` and `ofiletrace` tables), which was affecting the performance of the Audit Log Backup process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Activating the necessary database partitions as per the steps provided by R&D.
- Running the migration script to create partitions in the affected tables.
- Verifying the successful creation of partitions and ensuring that the Audit Log Backup process was functioning correctly thereafter.

## Notes
- Ensure that database tables are properly partitioned to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for updates and apply them to maintain server performance.
- Monitor the Audit Log Backup process to confirm successful execution and log generation.
