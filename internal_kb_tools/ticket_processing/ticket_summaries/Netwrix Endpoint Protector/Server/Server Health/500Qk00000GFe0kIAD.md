- **Case Number:** 422112
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, requested support for optimizing their EPP (Endpoint Protector) server following a migration from an m5.2xlarge to a c6i.4xlarge AWS instance.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Instance Type:** m5.2xlarge
- **New Instance Type:** c6i.4xlarge
- **Product in Use:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a support session with the customer to discuss optimization.
2. Reviewed the server configuration and performance metrics post-migration.
3. Analyzed resource allocation and utilization on the new AWS instance.
4. Implemented recommended optimizations based on the new instance specifications.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to adjust the EPP server settings and configurations to align with the performance characteristics of the new AWS instance type (c6i.4xlarge), which has different resource allocations compared to the previous instance.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by optimizing the EPP server settings to better utilize the resources available on the c6i.4xlarge instance. This included adjustments to memory allocation, CPU usage, and other performance parameters to enhance server efficiency.

## Notes
- It is important to review and optimize server settings after any migration to a different instance type to ensure optimal performance.
- Future migrations should include a checklist for server optimization to prevent similar issues.
