## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to reach the service, receiving an `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT` error when attempting to access the URL: [ryp97b8.hosted.endpointprotector.com](https://ryp97b8.hosted.endpointprotector.com).

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the backend server of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the URL and confirmed the error message (`ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`).
2. Attempted to connect to the backend server but could not establish a connection.
3. Restarted the server after obtaining permission from the DevOps team.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified; however, it was determined that the server was unresponsive and required a restart to restore functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a server restart. After the restart, the service became accessible, and the error was eliminated.

## Notes
- Future cases involving similar timeout errors should consider a server restart as a potential solution.
- Always ensure to obtain necessary permissions from the DevOps team before attempting to connect to or restart backend services.
