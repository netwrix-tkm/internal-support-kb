## Problem Description
The customer reported that the disk space on their server was full, causing the system to log the user out after 3 minutes of inactivity when accessing the panel.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a server managed by Sazcılar Otomotiv.
- The server was experiencing insufficient hardware resources due to low disk space.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the disk space was full and that the system logged users out after 3 minutes.
2. Scheduled a remote session to clean up unnecessary logs and increase disk space.
3. Deleted shadow copies older than 60 days to free up space.
4. Resized the `sda5` partition to allocate more disk space.
5. Coordinated with the account manager to create a Salesforce account for the customer.
6. Set the ticket status to "Awaiting Sales" until the account was created.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was insufficient disk space on the server, which was exacerbated by the presence of old shadow copies that consumed significant storage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting shadow copies older than 60 days, which freed up disk space.
- Resizing the `sda5` partition to provide additional space for the server's operations.
- Once the account was created in Salesforce, the ticket was marked as resolved.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space and manage shadow copies to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup processes for old logs and shadow copies to maintain sufficient disk space.
- Ensure that all necessary accounts are created in Salesforce promptly to avoid delays in ticket resolution.
