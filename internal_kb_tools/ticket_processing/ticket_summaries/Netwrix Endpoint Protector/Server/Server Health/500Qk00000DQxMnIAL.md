- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Health
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a specific patch needed to be applied three times, as it repeatedly prompted for installation. Additionally, there were concerns regarding email alerts not functioning correctly, as a recent test did not send an alert for a device connection.

## Environment Details

- **Collector Code:** Server
- **Age of the Issue:** 1.3 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that the patch was applied successfully each time it was prompted.
2. The customer conducted a test to verify the functionality of email alerts, which failed to send an alert for a connected device.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, the repeated prompts for the patch installation suggest a potential issue with the patch not being retained or recognized by the system after installation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the patch had been applied successfully. Further investigation may be required to determine why the patch was prompting for reinstallation multiple times, but the immediate concern regarding the patch was addressed.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the patch installation process closely to ensure that it is retained after application.
- For future cases involving email alerts, ensure that the alert configuration settings are correctly set up and that there are no underlying connectivity issues that could affect email delivery.
