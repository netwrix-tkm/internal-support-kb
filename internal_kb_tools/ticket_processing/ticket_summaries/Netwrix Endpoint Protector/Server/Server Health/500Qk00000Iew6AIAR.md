## Problem Description
The customer reported that their server was down again and requested assistance to determine the cause of the recurring issue.

## Environment Details
The server is hosted on AWS and is accessible via the URL: [https://896h1sm.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/](https://896h1sm.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Andrei Pop, reached out to the customer to schedule a remote connection for troubleshooting.
2. The customer confirmed that the server is hosted on AWS and provided the access URL, indicating no need for a remote connection to their local machine.
3. The support engineer accessed the server directly and began investigating the issue.
4. After analysis, the engineer identified that the server was not efficiently using its resources.
5. The engineer optimized the server's resource usage.
6. The engineer requested confirmation from the customer to check if they could log in to the server after the adjustments were made.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be related to inefficient resource usage on the server, which led to its downtime.

## Solution
The server was optimized to use available resources more efficiently, which resolved the downtime issue. The support engineer confirmed that the server was operational and requested the customer to verify access.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Client refresh time in "Device Control > Global settings" is set to at least 300 seconds to maintain optimal performance.
- Monitor server resource usage regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
