## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with the installation of an SSL certificate for the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) platform, emphasizing the urgency due to ongoing security enhancement activities.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved accessing the backend of the server through the EPP VM console.
- The customer was using a previously configured machine with the same IP address for the new setup.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to access the backend of the server through the EPP VM console.
2. Restarted the machine, but the issue persisted.
3. Tried to access the GRUB menu; however, selecting the console or boot option returned to the initial page.
4. Shut down the old machine and created a new one using the same IP address.
5. Added the SSL certificate to the new machine.
6. Successfully accessed the EPP UI using both IP and Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
7. Uploaded the license.
8. Updated the EPP server to the latest version (5.9.4.1).

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from configuration problems with the old machine, which prevented proper access to the server's backend. Creating a new machine and correctly configuring it resolved the access issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Creating a new machine with the same IP address as the old one.
- Importing the SSL certificate successfully.
- Ensuring access to the EPP UI was functional via both IP and FQDN.
- Updating the server to the latest version to ensure compatibility and security.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the SSL certificate is correctly imported and that the server is updated to the latest version to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the configuration of the server and its components before proceeding with SSL installations or updates.
