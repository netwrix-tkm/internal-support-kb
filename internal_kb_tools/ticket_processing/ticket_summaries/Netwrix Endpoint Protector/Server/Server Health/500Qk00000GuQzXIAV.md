## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Device Control Tab displayed an incorrect count of 11,078 identical network printers, with no other devices shown. They confirmed that this number was inaccurate, as they did not possess that many network printers. However, when searching for specific device types, such as "bluetooth," the system correctly listed all available Bluetooth devices.

## Environment Details
- The appliance was running on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the count of network printers displayed in the Device Control Tab.
2. Conducted searches for specific device types (e.g., Bluetooth) to confirm the system's ability to list other devices.
3. Reviewed the configuration settings of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to identify any discrepancies.
4. Discussed potential upgrade paths for the server to a more recent version of Ubuntu.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it was implied that the system may have been misconfigured or experiencing a bug related to the display of network devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer confirmed that the problem had been addressed, although specific steps taken to resolve the issue were not detailed in the correspondence. It is suggested that the customer may have applied a configuration change or update that corrected the device listing.

## Notes
- The customer was advised on how to upgrade their server from Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS to a more recent version, which may help prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is important to monitor the Device Control Tab for any discrepancies in device counts, especially when dealing with a large number of similar devices.
