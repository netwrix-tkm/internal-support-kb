- **Case Number:** 425055
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Logiq Consulting
- **Contact Name:** Matt Burns
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Access Error
- **Feature:** Server Access
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested access and permission to install the Azure Backup Agent and Tenable Agent on a virtual machine (VM). They specifically needed SSH access to perform these installations.

## Environment Details
- The request was made for a VM managed under the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer had previously signed an agreement for backend access.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's request for SSH access to install third-party applications.
2. Notified the customer that third-party applications are not supported on the Endpoint Protector server.
3. Offered to send an agreement for backend access to allow the customer to proceed with the installations.
4. Scheduled a meeting to facilitate the installation process after confirming the agreement was signed.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for backend access to install third-party applications, which is not typically supported by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform without proper agreements and permissions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Installing the requested Azure Backup Agent and Tenable Agent on the VM after the necessary permissions were granted through the signed agreement.
- The installation was completed successfully during a scheduled meeting with the customer.

## Notes
- Future requests for installing third-party applications on the Endpoint Protector server should be accompanied by a signed agreement to ensure compliance with company policies.
- Always confirm the customer's availability for meetings to facilitate installations and provide necessary support.
