## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IMMKVIA5
- **Case Number:** 427202
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TLT-Turbo GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Benedikt Schallert
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the web server for Netwrix Endpoint Protector was offline, preventing access to the web interface. Despite rebooting the appliance multiple times, the issue persisted, and the customer was unable to download the client package necessary for software deployment.

## Environment Details
- The customer was in the process of implementing Endpoint Protector.
- The server had been updated prior to the issue occurring.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer rebooted the appliance twice.
2. The customer confirmed that they could ping the server and establish a TCP connection to port 22 (SSH).
3. The customer noted that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were closed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as closed ports 80 and 443, which are essential for web server functionality. The specific reason for the ports being closed was not detailed in the communication.

## Solution
The technical support engineer suggested allowing port 443 to see if the web interface became accessible. After confirming that port 443 was indeed open, the web server became reachable, resolving the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that ports 80 and 443 are open for web server access in future implementations of Endpoint Protector.
- Regular monitoring of server ports can help preemptively identify similar issues before they affect access to critical services.
