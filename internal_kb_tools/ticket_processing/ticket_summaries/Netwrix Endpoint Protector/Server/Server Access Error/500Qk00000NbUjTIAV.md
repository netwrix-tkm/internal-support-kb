The customer, Armando Basurto Moreno from Censys, requested assistance with the password reset process for accessing the DLP Endpoint Protector system.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Flaviu Moldovan, reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session for troubleshooting.
2. A remote session was arranged via Zoom to assist the customer with the password reset.
3. During the session, the support engineer reset the customer's password from the backend.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a need for a password reset, which was not something the customer could perform on their own.

## Solution
The support engineer successfully reset the customer's password from the backend during the remote session. After the reset, the customer was able to log back into the system without any further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the backend password reset option for future cases where they are unable to access their accounts.
- It may be beneficial to provide documentation or guidance on how customers can reset their passwords independently, if applicable.
