- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EVy9WIAT
- **Case Number:** 418314
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** VAI Marketing Management
- **Contact Name:** Andre Le Roux
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to open the web interface of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, indicating a server access error.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to a corrupted database that affected the functionality of the web interface.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment revealed a corrupted database with no available backups.
2. DevOps team suggested various recovery options, including:
   - Removing `ib_logfile*` from the MySQL directory.
   - Trying all options for `innodb_force_recovery` from 1 to 6.
   - Checking for backups in `/var/eppfiles/backup/patches`.
3. A remote session was conducted to attempt database recovery.
4. Commands were executed to perform a MySQL dump while excluding four specific tables:
   - `eppdatabase.cf_ilog`
   - `eppdatabase.cf_log`
   - `eppdatabase.log`
   - `eppdatabase.ofiletrace`
5. A backup of the MySQL directory was created, and the MySQL folder was recreated.
6. The SQL dump was imported back into MySQL.
7. The event logs were checked for functionality.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a corrupted database, which prevented the web interface from loading properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Running the MySQL service in forced recovery mode (`innodb_force_recovery = 2`).
- Executing a MySQL dump while excluding the corrupted tables.
- Recreating the MySQL directory and importing the dump back into the database.
- Restoring the functionality of the web interface, although four tables still needed to be recreated.

## Notes
- The following tables still need to be recreated for full functionality:
  - `ofiletrace`
  - `cf_log`
  - `log`
  - `cf_ilog`
- Future cases involving database corruption should prioritize having backups available to facilitate recovery.
- Ensure to document any commands used for recovery for future reference.
