- **Case Number:** 415990
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Paul Hastings LLP
- **Contact Name:** David Sindell
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The network settings for the Virtual Appliance (VA) were reset, resulting in the need to restore the communication port (4444) used by clients. Console access was restored, but the specific configuration for the port was unclear.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a Netwrix Endpoint Protector server.
- The server version in use was noted to be quite old (5.2.0.5), which limited certain functionalities.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that console access to the VA was restored.
2. Attempted to identify where the port settings could be configured.
3. Engaged in discussions regarding the migration of settings and rights from the old server version.
4. Noted that the custom rights could not be imported directly due to the old server version.
5. Explored options for exporting device lists and rights from the old server.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the reset of network settings on the VA, which included the loss of the configured communication port settings. Additionally, the outdated server version (5.2.0.5) posed limitations on the ability to migrate settings and rights effectively.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a port separation and providing the necessary information regarding the migration process. The communication port (4444) was successfully restored, allowing client communications to resume.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the server is updated to a more recent version to avoid similar issues in the future, as older versions may lack critical functionalities and support for migration.
- Always document the current configuration settings before any resets or upgrades to facilitate easier recovery.
