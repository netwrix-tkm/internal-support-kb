## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the web console at the specified URL, indicating a recurring issue similar to a previous ticket (#00425339).

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The web console URL provided was: [https://xm861dp.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/](https://xm861dp.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the accessibility of the web console URL.
2. Checked AWS health checks and found that 1 out of 3 health checks had failed.
3. Rebooted the server hosting the web console.

## Root Cause
The failure of 1 out of the 3 AWS health checks rendered the web console inaccessible.

## Solution
Rebooting the server resolved the issue, allowing access to the web console once again.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor AWS health checks regularly to prevent similar accessibility issues in the future.
- If the problem recurs, consider checking server performance and health checks before proceeding with a reboot.
