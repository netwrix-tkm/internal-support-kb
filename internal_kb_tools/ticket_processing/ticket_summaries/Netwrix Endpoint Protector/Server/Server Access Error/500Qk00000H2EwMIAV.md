## Problem Description
The customer reported that after activating the Server Certificate Stack, their website became inaccessible.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Attempted to access the website from different browsers and devices to rule out local issues.
4. Reviewed the server configuration settings to ensure proper SSL certificate installation.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding a valid SSL certificate to the Epp server. This restored access to the website.

- Ensure that a valid SSL certificate is in place before activating the Server Certificate Stack to prevent similar access issues in the future.
- Regularly check and renew SSL certificates to avoid service interruptions.
