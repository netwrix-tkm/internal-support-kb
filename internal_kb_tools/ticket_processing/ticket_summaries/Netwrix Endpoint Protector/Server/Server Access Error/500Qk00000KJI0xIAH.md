## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KJI0xIAH
- **Case Number:** 431320
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baader Bank
- **Contact Name:** Florian Wolfschaffner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after successfully uploading their own SSL certificate, it was flagged as insecure by the browser. The browser displayed a message indicating the use of an older TLS version (TLS 1.0) with a specific cipher suite, despite the certificate being created with a higher encryption standard.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server.
- The server was initially configured to use TLS 1.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the SSL certificate upload process.
2. Checked the TLS version currently in use on the EPP server.
3. Identified that the server was using TLS 1.0, which is outdated and insecure.
4. Modified the server configuration to use TLS 1.2.
5. Instructed the customer to regenerate the SSL certificate after the TLS version change.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the EPP server was configured to use an outdated TLS version (1.0), which did not support the higher encryption standards of the newly uploaded SSL certificate.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the server's TLS configuration from version 1.0 to 1.2. After this modification, the customer was instructed to regenerate the SSL certificate, which was then confirmed to be functioning correctly and was no longer flagged as insecure by the browser.

## Notes
- Ensure that all servers are configured to use at least TLS 1.2 to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update security protocols to comply with current standards and best practices.
- Document any changes made to server configurations for future reference and troubleshooting.
