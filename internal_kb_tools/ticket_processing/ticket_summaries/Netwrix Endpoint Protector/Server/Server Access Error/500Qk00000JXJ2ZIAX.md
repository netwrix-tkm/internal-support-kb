## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix server console became inaccessible, continuously reloading after SSO authentication. This issue began on the morning of December 16, 2024, following an upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 on December 13, 2024.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem introduced by the recent upgrade to version 5.9.4.1, which affected the SSO authentication process, causing the server console to reload indefinitely.
