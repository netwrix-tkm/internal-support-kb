- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NGa2LIAT
- **Case Number:** 439791
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Robins Kaplan
- **Contact Name:** Nicoleta Cornea
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they could not access the Netwrix admin portal, receiving a "502 Bad Gateway" error when attempting to log in.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the SaaS version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific URL affected was: [Netwrix Portal](https://g8nrjbx.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/login).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician requested permission to log into the backend of the server to investigate the issue.
2. Upon accessing the server, it was determined that the PHP service had stopped due to a memory issue (oom-kill).
3. The PHP service was restarted to restore functionality.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the PHP service being stopped due to an out-of-memory (oom-kill) condition, which prevented access to the admin portal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by restarting the PHP service, which restored access to the admin portal. The technician confirmed that the console was functioning properly after the restart.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the hosted environment continuously and ensure alerts are configured to notify both the support team and the customer in case of service interruptions.
- Endpoint clients remain functional and retain their settings locally even if the admin console is unavailable, as they do not require constant connectivity to the server for basic operations.
