- **Case Number:** 412582
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Sakshi Sable
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Access Error
- **Feature:** DLP Dashboard
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to access the DLP (Data Loss Prevention) dashboard on their server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to accessing the backend server UI, which was only displaying configuration settings without providing access to the full server console.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team acknowledged the issue and requested additional details from the customer.
2. The customer was asked to provide error messages and screenshots related to the access issue.
3. The support team inquired if the customer could ping and telnet the server.
4. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
5. The server was rebooted from the cluster, which allowed access to the DLP console.
6. The customer reported that they still faced issues with backend server access, specifically needing the GRUB passphrase to reset the server username and password.

## Root Cause
The inability to access the DLP dashboard was primarily due to incorrect server credentials and the requirement for a GRUB passphrase to reset the password. Additionally, security policies restricted SSH access to the backend server.

## Solution
- After rebooting the server, access to the DLP console was restored.
- The support team informed the customer that access to the backend server would require signing a disclaimer due to security policies.
- The management team was engaged to analyze the request for backend access and provide the necessary credentials if approved.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the security policies regarding backend access and the need for a disclaimer.
- Monitor disk space alerts closely, as they can lead to access issues if not addressed promptly.
- Future requests for backend access should be accompanied by a clear explanation of the need and potential impacts on service availability.
