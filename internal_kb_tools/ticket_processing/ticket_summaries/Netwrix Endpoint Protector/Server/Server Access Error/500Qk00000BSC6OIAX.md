## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BSC6OIAX
- **Case Number:** 411000
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Timberland Bank
- **Contact Name:** JJ Johnson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported authentication issues characterized by failed logins on the server and failed traffic from some hosts. This problem was believed to be related to a recent change requiring secure communications for all internal network traffic.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Engaged in a remote session to investigate the issue.
2. Reviewed server logs to identify patterns in failed logins and traffic.
3. Assessed the configuration settings related to secure communications.
4. Discussed potential environmental factors that could affect authentication, such as load balancers or certificate issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the authentication issues was identified as a certificate problem. The client was intermittently able to retrieve the certificate from the server but subsequently encountered 401 errors when attempting to communicate using that certificate.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session by:
- Correcting the certificate configuration to ensure proper secure communication.
- Verifying that all hosts were correctly configured to use the new secure communication settings.

## Notes
- Future implementations of secure communication should include thorough testing of certificate configurations to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to monitor server logs closely after making significant changes to network security settings to quickly identify and address any arising issues.
