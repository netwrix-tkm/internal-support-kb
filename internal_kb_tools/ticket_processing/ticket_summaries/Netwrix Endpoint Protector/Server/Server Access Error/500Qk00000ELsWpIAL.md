## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ELsWpIAL
- **Case Number:** 417900
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** French Defence Ministry Paris (MINISTERE DEFENSE) / DGSE
- **Contact Name:** Luc Vantroost
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported two main issues: 
1. Sporadic instabilities with a server leading to a user being unable to access their USB key, despite the Endpoint agent indicating synchronization.
2. A request for a resized VM for a second team that was not processed, resulting in prolonged boot times of over 1 hour and 30 minutes.

## Environment Details
- The issues were occurring on a server running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The USB key had been associated with a user for an extended period.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the synchronization status of the Endpoint agent on the user's workstation.
2. Attempted to delete the USB key/user association in the Endpoint console and recreate it, which temporarily resolved the access issue.
3. Tested a VM downloaded from the Netwrix site to compare boot times after importing databases.
4. Analyzed the disk size of the VM generated by COSOSYS versus the one downloaded from Netwrix.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the USB key access issue was identified as a failure in the user/USB key association within the Endpoint console, leading to sporadic access problems. The VM boot time issue was attributed to the larger disk size of the VM generated by COSOSYS, which likely contained more data and configurations than the smaller VM tested.

## Solution
- For the USB key access issue, the solution involved deleting the existing key/user association in the Endpoint console and recreating it, which restored access for the user.
- For the VM boot time issue, it was recommended to resize the VM appropriately and ensure that the disk size was optimized for performance, potentially by reducing unnecessary data or configurations.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the USB key/user associations regularly to prevent similar access issues.
- Future VM requests should include a review of disk size and configurations to avoid prolonged boot times.
- A meeting was scheduled with the customer to discuss any ongoing issues, indicating a proactive approach to customer support.
