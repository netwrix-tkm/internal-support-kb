- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to change their password due to an expired password notification. When attempting to change the password, the system rejected the current password with the message: "The password provided is different from the existing password."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The user logged in and was prompted to set a new password.
2. The user copied and pasted the new password into the corresponding field.
3. The system did not accept the new password, indicating that it did not save.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch between the password being entered and the existing password, likely due to a formatting issue when copying and pasting the password.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Resetting the root password for the user account.
2. Changing the password expiration time to prevent immediate expiration issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are advised to manually type their passwords instead of copying and pasting, as this can sometimes introduce hidden characters or formatting issues.
- Monitor password expiration settings to avoid similar issues in the future.
