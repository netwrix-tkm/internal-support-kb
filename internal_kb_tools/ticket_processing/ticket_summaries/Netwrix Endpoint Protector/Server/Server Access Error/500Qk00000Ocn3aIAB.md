- **Case Number:** 443668
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DockYard
- **Contact Name:** Victor Oates
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the EPP (Endpoint Protector) server.

## Environment Details
- High swap memory usage was noted, which may have contributed to the server's inaccessibility.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified high swap memory as a potential issue.
2. Requested access to the server.
3. Rebooted the server to alleviate high memory usage.
4. Confirmed accessibility via both IP and FQDN after the reboot.
5. Reset the password on the new EPP server.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by high swap memory usage, which likely led to the server becoming unresponsive.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by rebooting the server, which cleared the high swap memory condition. After the reboot, the server was accessible again, both through its IP address and fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Additionally, the password for the new EPP server was reset as part of the resolution process.

## Notes
- Monitor swap memory usage regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that server access is verified post-reboot to confirm resolution.
- Consider implementing alerts for high memory usage to proactively address potential server inaccessibility.
