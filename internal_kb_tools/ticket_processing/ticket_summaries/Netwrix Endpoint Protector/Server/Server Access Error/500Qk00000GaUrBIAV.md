## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GaUrBIAV
- **Case Number:** 422833
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Nayan Rajore
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access their Netwrix EPP server through the web console, encountering an error. Additionally, upon checking the status of the EPP VM instance, another error was observed. Restarting the VM instance resulted in the terminal being stuck at initramfs.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **VM Instance:** EPP VM instance

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked the status of the EPP VM instance and noted the errors.
2. Attempted to restart the VM instance.
3. Observed that after the restart, the terminal was stuck at initramfs.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, the symptoms suggest that there may have been a filesystem corruption or misconfiguration that prevented the VM from booting properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a filesystem check and repair on the EPP VM instance. This process involved:
1. Booting the VM into recovery mode.
2. Running the command `fsck` to check and repair the filesystem.
3. Once the filesystem was repaired, the VM was rebooted successfully, allowing access to the EPP server through the web console.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor the health of VM instances and perform routine maintenance to prevent filesystem issues.
- If the terminal is stuck at initramfs, it is crucial to check for filesystem errors as a first troubleshooting step.
- Ensure that backups are taken before performing any repair operations on the filesystem to avoid data loss.
