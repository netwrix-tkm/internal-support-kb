## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ICzDUIA1
- **Case Number:** 426806
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Advisory Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Anoush d'Orville
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported intermittent login errors when attempting to access the Netwrix Endpoint Protector portal. The errors included messages indicating incorrect username or password, or a general login process error.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using auto-fill functionality from 1Password to enter their credentials.
- The login URL was: [https://5jfh4tl.hosted.endpointprotector.com/](https://5jfh4tl.hosted.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested details about the authentication method being used (e.g., SSO solutions like OKTA or Azure SSO).
2. Suggested the customer manually enter their password instead of using the auto-fill feature to see if the issue persisted.
3. Awaited further communication from the customer regarding the status of the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a potential conflict with the auto-fill functionality of the password manager (1Password) and the authentication process. Additionally, the customer implemented Okta for authentication, which resolved the issue.

## Solution
The customer successfully resolved the issue internally by implementing Okta for authentication. After this change, the login errors ceased, and the customer confirmed that everything was functioning as expected.

## Notes
- It is advisable to check for conflicts with password managers when users report login issues, especially if they are using auto-fill features.
- Encourage customers to manually enter their credentials during troubleshooting to rule out issues related to auto-fill.
- Ensure to follow up with customers after suggesting changes to confirm whether the issue has been resolved before closing the ticket.
