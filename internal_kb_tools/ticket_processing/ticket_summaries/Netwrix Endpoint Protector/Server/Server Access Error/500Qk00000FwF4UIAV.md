- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to log in to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) due to connection timeouts when attempting to connect to `pngrch7.hosted.endpointprotector.com`. Additionally, the installer was also experiencing issues connecting to the same endpoint.

## Environment Details

4. Engaged the development operations (DevOps) team to investigate server status and performance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a server-related problem that required a reboot. The server was likely experiencing performance issues or was unresponsive, leading to the connection timeouts reported by the customer.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the DevOps team rebooting the server hosting the endpoint. After the reboot, the customer was able to successfully log in to the EPP and the installer was able to connect without issues.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor server performance regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
