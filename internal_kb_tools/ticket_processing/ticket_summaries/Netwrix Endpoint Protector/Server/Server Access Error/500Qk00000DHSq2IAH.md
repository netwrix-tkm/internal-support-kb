- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Singapore- Black Sesame Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Helin Lu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their EPP server dashboard displayed an error, and after rebooting the server, it became stuck in maintenance mode. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, the server would not boot normally.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer rebooted the server multiple times.
2. The server was checked for errors and was found to be stuck in maintenance mode.
3. The support technician checked the disk using the `e2fsck` command to identify any filesystem issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, the server's inability to boot normally after being stuck in maintenance mode suggests potential filesystem corruption or disk errors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running the `e2fsck` command on the disk, which checked and repaired any filesystem errors. This action allowed the server to exit maintenance mode and boot up normally.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly check the server's filesystem integrity to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that backups are taken before performing disk checks or repairs to avoid data loss.
