- **Case Number:** 422504
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access their EPP server console, encountering a "500 Internal Server Error" message. The error indicated that something was broken on the server side.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Service in Question:** MySQL service

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the status of the MySQL service, which was running but unresponsive.
2. Attempted to restart the MySQL service, but it did not start even with recovery options.
3. Investigated the server logs for any additional error messages or clues.
4. Removed the `iblogfile` from the MySQL directory as a potential fix.
5. Restarted the server to ensure all services were properly initialized.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a problem with the MySQL service, which was running but not functioning correctly. The presence of a problematic `iblogfile` was preventing the service from operating as expected.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the `iblogfile`, which allowed the MySQL service to start correctly. After the removal, the service was restarted, and upon rebooting the server, the MySQL service continued to run without issues.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the MySQL service after any changes to ensure stability.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking for corrupted files or logs that may affect service performance.
- Regular backups of the MySQL data and configuration files are recommended to prevent data loss during troubleshooting.
