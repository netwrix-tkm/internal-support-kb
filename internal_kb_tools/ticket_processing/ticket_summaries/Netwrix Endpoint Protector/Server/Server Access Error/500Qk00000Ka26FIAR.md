## Problem Description
The customer reported experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to access the EPP server. Immediate assistance was requested to resolve the issue remotely.

## Environment Details
- **Server Type:** EPP server
- **Error Type:** 500 Internal Server Error
- **File Path:** /var/lib/mysql/

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs to identify the cause of the 500 Internal Server Error.
2. Attempted to restart the MySQL service, which failed due to the presence of corrupted log files.
3. Identified the log files `ib_logfile0` and `ib_logfile1` as potential culprits for the service failure.
4. Moved the identified log files from the `/var/lib/mysql/` directory to allow the MySQL service to start.

## Root Cause
The 500 Internal Server Error was caused by corrupted MySQL log files (`ib_logfile0` and `ib_logfile1`), which prevented the MySQL service from starting properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by moving the corrupted log files (`ib_logfile0` and `ib_logfile1`) from the `/var/lib/mysql/` directory. After this action, the MySQL service was able to start normally, and the EPP server became accessible again.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the MySQL logs regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a backup strategy for log files to facilitate recovery in case of corruption.
- Ensure that the MySQL service is properly configured to handle log file management to avoid potential service interruptions.
