## Problem Description
The customer reported encountering a "500 Internal Server Error" while trying to access the Netwrix Endpoint Protector portal, indicating that something was broken on the server side.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a server with multiple partitions, specifically the 5th partition was full, which contributed to the error.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the client's machine with the assistance of Botond-Robert Biro.
2. Verified the status of the partitions and found that the 5th partition was full.
3. Removed old backups, shadow copies, and upgrade patch backups from the 5th partition after obtaining client approval.
4. Checked the partition usage post-cleanup, which showed that approximately 10% of the partition was now occupied.
5. Attempted to access the portal again, which was successful.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the "500 Internal Server Error" was identified as the 5th partition being full, which prevented the server from processing requests properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing unnecessary files from the 5th partition, including old backups and shadows, which freed up space.
- After the cleanup, the client was able to access the portal without any further issues.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space on server partitions regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that old backups and unnecessary files are managed effectively to maintain optimal server performance.
