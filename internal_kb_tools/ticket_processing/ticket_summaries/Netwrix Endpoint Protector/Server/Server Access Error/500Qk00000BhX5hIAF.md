## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BhX5hIAF
- **Case Number:** 411608
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that users were unable to log in to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console, resulting in a loss of connection.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server had been online for 175 days prior to troubleshooting.
- High resource allocation was previously configured on the EPP server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to address the issue.
2. Optimized the EPP server resources to align with current needs, reducing previously excessive resource allocation.
3. Rebooted the EPP server to refresh its state.
4. Updated the Active Directory (AD) Admin Authentication settings with the correct LDAP configuration.
5. Disabled the "Ignore AD Authentication" option for all admin users.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by excessive resource allocation on the EPP server, which led to slow UI response times and ultimately prevented user logins. Additionally, incorrect LDAP settings and the "Ignore AD Authentication" option being enabled contributed to the authentication failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Optimizing server resources to appropriate levels.
- Rebooting the server to clear any potential stale states.
- Correcting the LDAP settings for AD Admin Authentication.
- Disabling the "Ignore AD Authentication" option, allowing proper authentication for admin users.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor server resource allocation regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that LDAP settings are verified and correct to avoid authentication problems.
- Consider scheduling regular server reboots to maintain optimal performance, especially for servers that have been running for extended periods.
