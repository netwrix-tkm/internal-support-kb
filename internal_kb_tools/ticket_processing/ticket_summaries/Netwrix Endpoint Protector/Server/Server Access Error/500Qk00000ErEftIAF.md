- **Case Number:** 419011
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arista Networks, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Bharani M
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after a network configuration change, the server became unreachable. Attempts to reboot the server on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) were unsuccessful, and the user interface displayed an error indicating that Nginx failed to load.

## Environment Details
- Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Service: Nginx
- Network Configuration: Recently modified

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to reboot the server on the GCP end.
2. Checked the status of the Nginx service, which was not starting.
3. Noted that only one network interface (eth0) was active.
4. Re-installed the server image.
5. Upgraded the server.
6. Migrated the server to a different configuration.
7. Swapped IP addresses to see if connectivity issues were resolved.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure of the Nginx service to start, which was likely related to the recent network configuration changes. The server was only utilizing one network interface (eth0), which may have contributed to the connectivity issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by re-installing the server image, upgrading the system, migrating to a new configuration, and swapping IP addresses. After these steps, the server became operational and accessible.

## Notes
- Ensure that network configurations are thoroughly tested before implementation to avoid similar issues.
- Monitor the status of critical services like Nginx after any network changes to quickly identify and resolve potential failures.
- Consider documenting the configuration changes made to facilitate troubleshooting in the future.
