- **Case Number:** 441671
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FC Brasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested a password change for two servers due to one server being locked with an unknown password and the other server having forgotten the password.

## Environment Details
- **Servers Involved:**
  - [Vaas Server](https://lsj8a61.hosted.endpointprotector.com)
  - [Norteenergia Server](https://bts8awj.hosted.endpointprotector.com)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Request:** Customer requested password changes for both servers.
2. **Clarification:** Support technician confirmed with the customer about the user accounts and obtained permission to access the server backend.
3. **Password Reset:** Passwords for both servers were reset to a temporary password ('epp2011').
4. **Follow-Up:** Customer reported that the Vaas server password reset did not work, while the Norteenergia server was successful.
5. **Verification:** Support technician checked and confirmed that both accounts were able to log in and change their passwords successfully.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the customer not having the correct password for the Vaas server, which led to the request for a reset. The initial reset attempt for the Vaas server did not take effect, causing confusion.

## Solution
The passwords for both servers were reset to 'epp2011'. After the reset, the customer was instructed to have the users log in and change their passwords. A follow-up confirmed that the users were able to log in successfully and create a new user account.

## Notes
- Ensure to verify the success of password resets with the customer immediately after the action is taken.
- Always confirm the specific user accounts that require password resets to avoid confusion.
- Document any temporary passwords used and remind customers to change them upon first login.
