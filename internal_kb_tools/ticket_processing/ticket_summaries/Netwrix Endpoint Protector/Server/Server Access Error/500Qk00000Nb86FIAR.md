- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MRM-Mccann
- **Contact Name:** Hemant Mistry
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported being unable to access the Server Admin Console after changing the DNS settings in the Server Management section. They encountered a "Connection Refused" error when attempting to access the server via a web browser.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on an Azure virtual machine.
- The DNS settings were modified, which affected connectivity to the server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the DNS change and its impact on server accessibility.
2. Suggested reverting the DNS settings to the previous configuration.
3. Inquired if the new DNS was correctly tied to the internal IP of the Azure image.
4. Attempted to access the server console remotely but found the customer lacked SSH access.
5. Created an Azure DevOps (ADO) task for the development team to investigate potential issues with the netplan configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the netplan configuration being overwritten when the DNS settings were changed. This led to the server becoming inaccessible.

## Solution
The resolution involved collaborating with the DevOps team to recreate the netplan configuration, which restored access to the Server Admin Console.

## Notes
- It is important to note that changing DNS settings can overwrite netplan configurations, leading to connectivity issues. 
- Future changes to DNS should be carefully planned, and it may be advisable to have backup access methods (like SSH) available to revert changes if necessary.
- Ensure that any DNS changes are validated against the internal IP configurations to prevent similar issues.
