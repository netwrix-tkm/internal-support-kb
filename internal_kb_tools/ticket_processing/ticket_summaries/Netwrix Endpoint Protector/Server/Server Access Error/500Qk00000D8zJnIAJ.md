## Problem Description
The user was unable to change their current password when prompted during login, receiving an error message stating, "The password provided is different from the existing password," despite entering the correct password.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a test server, but the user provided information from their production server for context.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer suggested checking if the user had access to another admin account to change the password via System Configuration -> System Administrators.
2. The user confirmed they did not have another admin account and requested to schedule a remote session for assistance.
3. The support engineer scheduled a remote session to reset the password from the backend.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was likely related to a password mismatch or a potential issue with the password management system that prevented the user from successfully changing their password.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a password reset during the scheduled remote session. The support engineer reset the user's password, allowing them to log in successfully.

## Notes
- Users should ensure they have access to an admin account for password management to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If no admin account is available, a remote session may be necessary to reset passwords from the backend.
- It is advisable to verify the password being entered for any discrepancies, such as case sensitivity or extra spaces, even when copying and pasting.
