## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BnWLTIA3
- **Case Number:** 411861
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Zeon Europe GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Nigel Trego
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Access Error
- **Feature:** Server Access
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had no access to the console of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, despite being able to ping the server's IP address.

## Environment Details
- The issue was occurring on a server with an IP address that was reachable via ping.
- The customer was using two virtual appliances (VAs) that exhibited the same issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer could ping the server's IP address.
2. Asked the customer to check for error messages when trying to connect to the console.
3. Suggested using the telnet command to check connectivity on port 443, which resulted in a "connection refused" message.
4. Inquired whether the customer could SSH into the unit, which they confirmed but needed credentials.
5. Conducted a remote session to investigate the backend and found that the nginx service was not functioning correctly.
6. Attempted to restart the nginx service during the remote session.
7. Discussed the need to check the version of the EPP server for further troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the nginx service not starting correctly, which was likely due to IP restrictions and expired credentials for accessing the console.

## Solution
- The nginx service was restarted successfully during the remote session.
- The customer was advised to check the version of the EPP server and to ensure that the IP restrictions were appropriately configured.
- The customer was also guided to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) with Azure AD and to install the necessary certificates to resolve browser access issues.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor the device tab for any devices that may not have populated after the changes.
- A new case was opened for the issue of missing devices in the web interface to ensure it was tracked separately.
- It is important to ensure that all credentials and IP configurations are up to date to prevent similar access issues in the future.
