## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ORc3NIAT
- **Case Number:** 443186
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Denave India Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Amit Tomar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the One-Time Password (OTP) was not being accepted during the login process, preventing access to the server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) rather than OTP.
- The current time server was not synchronized, which affected the 2FA functionality.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested additional information and a screenshot of the error from the customer.
2. Conducted a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue.
3. Disabled 2FA in the database using the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   UPDATE sf_guard_user SET use_google_authentication=0 WHERE id=...;
   ```
4. Checked the EPP console and confirmed that the current time server was not synchronized.
5. Advised the customer to configure an appropriate NTP server to ensure time synchronization.
6. Followed up with the customer to confirm if the NTP server was configured.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration of the NTP server, which led to the current time server not being synchronized. This misalignment caused the 2FA to fail, resulting in the OTP not being accepted.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Disabling the 2FA temporarily to allow access to the EPP interface.
2. Instructing the customer to configure the NTP server correctly.
3. After the NTP server was configured, the customer confirmed that the 2FA was functioning as expected, and the OTP was accepted.

## Notes
- Ensure that the NTP server is properly configured in future cases involving 2FA to prevent similar issues.
- The customer was advised to reopen the ticket if any further issues related to 2FA arise after the configuration changes.
