- **Case Number:** 426635
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sardar Vallabhbhai Sahakari Bank Ltd
- **Contact Name:** NIRAV THAKER
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with connecting to the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system due to an IP address being removed automatically. When attempting to add the IP address back, an error message was displayed.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The specific environment details such as operating system or network configuration were not provided.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide the error message image, which was not visible in the initial communication.
2. The support team inquired whether the Endpoint Protector (EPP) user interface was available prior to the issue and what operations were performed that might have led to the change.
3. The customer was directed to check the installation guide for configuring a new virtual image, as it was suspected that this might be related to the issue.
4. A remote session was arranged to further investigate the problem.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a configuration problem related to the automatic removal of the IP address from the DLP settings, which may have been triggered by changes in the virtual environment or network settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following the procedure outlined in the internal documentation (Procedure 63). This involved reconfiguring the DLP settings to ensure that the IP address could be added back successfully without being removed automatically.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to the virtual environment or network settings are documented and communicated to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is recommended to regularly check the DLP configuration after any system updates or changes to the network to prevent automatic removals of critical settings.
