- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H0ZK9IAN
- **Case Number:** 423798
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Auriga Lab
- **Contact Name:** Auriga Notifications
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Auriga Srl, reported that their client was unable to access the management console of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) unless they downgraded the TLS settings in their browser to the lowest level (TLS 1.0). Despite updating the software to the latest version, the issue persisted.

## Environment Details
- The client was using a browser with TLS settings that were incompatible with the EPP management console.
- The EPP was initially running on an older version before the attempted upgrade.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to update the Endpoint Protector software to the latest version.
2. The support team communicated with the customer to gather more information about the issue.
3. The customer created a new virtual machine (VM) with Ubuntu 22 for the migration of the EPP.
4. The support team provided detailed migration steps to ensure a successful transition to the new VM.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as compatibility problems between the TLS settings of the browser and the version of the Endpoint Protector that was being used. The older version of EPP did not support higher TLS versions, which led to access issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by migrating the Endpoint Protector to a new image running on Ubuntu 22. This new setup allowed for proper TLS support, enabling the client to access the management console without needing to downgrade their TLS settings.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Endpoint Protector is always updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues with modern browsers.
- When migrating to a new server or VM, verify that both the old and new appliances are running the same version of the software to facilitate a smooth migration.
- Monitor the new setup for a few days after migration to ensure stability and functionality.
