## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ilb3OIAR
- **Case Number:** 428041
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Astorg Group SÃ rl
- **Contact Name:** Julien Millet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that none of their accounts were able to access the Endpoint Protector admin console, receiving a message stating, "The username or password entered is incorrect." The customer requested assistance with password reset as there was no link available for self-service password recovery.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on Netwrix systems and does not have access to the customer's domain controllers.
- The customer mentioned a potential correlation with a server restart performed by Netwrix the previous week.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the issue and confirmed that a support engineer would assist during business hours.
2. Provided a link for a remote session to further investigate the issue.
3. Reset the password for the admin account to "epp2011."
4. Inquired whether Active Directory (AD) authentication was enabled for the accounts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified, but it was implied that the password reset may have been necessary due to the server restart, which could have affected user authentication settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the password from the backend. The customer confirmed that they were able to log in successfully after the password reset. Additionally, the customer was informed about the possibility of enabling Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) authentication to avoid similar issues in the future.

## Notes
- The customer does not have AD authentication enabled due to their server being hosted on Netwrix systems.
- It was confirmed that AzureAD authentication could be enabled, which would not require a connection to the customer's domain controllers.
- Future cases should consider the implications of server restarts on user authentication and account access.
