- **Case Number:** 434625
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Viskase Companies
- **Contact Name:** Martin Polaszewski
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue applying a new license file for their Netwrix Endpoint Protector, encountering an ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error specifically on the EPP UI page, while other webpages remained accessible.

## Environment Details
- The server is running Nginx, PHP, and MySQL.
- The customer confirmed that there are no firewalls blocking the connection between the client and the EPP server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted access using different web browsers.
2. Verified that the HTTP client download page was accessible.
3. Checked network configuration using `ifconfig`, which appeared normal.
4. Confirmed that necessary services (nginx, php, mysql) were running.
5. Rebooted the EPP server twice.
6. Edited the `epp.nginx.conf` file to add support for TLSv1.3 (TLSv1 and TLSv1.2 were already present).
7. Changed the listening port from 443 to 8443 in the `epp.nginx.conf` file, but the UI still returned the same error.
8. Verified with the customer that ports were not blocked and that there was no firewall interference.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration in the `epp.nginx.conf` file. Specifically, the presence of TLSv1 was causing communication issues between the UI and EPP clients.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Editing the `epp.nginx.conf` file to remove TLSv1 and retain only TLSv1.2.
2. Clearing system disk space from 77% to around 50% to optimize performance.
3. Optimizing server resources to improve UI performance.
4. Applying all necessary backend security upgrades.

After these changes, both the EPP UI and clients were able to communicate successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `epp.nginx.conf` file is correctly configured with supported TLS versions to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly monitor disk space and optimize server resources to maintain performance.
- Always verify firewall settings and network configurations when encountering connectivity issues.
