## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ISIW2IAP
- **Case Number:** 427368
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** EnergoBit (Romania)
- **Contact Name:** IT Ebt
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The client, SC Energobit SA, reported an issue with accessing the Endpoint Protector console after attempting to upgrade an expired certificate using the "regenerate certificate" option. The operation failed, resulting in a complete loss of access to the console, which persisted even after restarting the virtual machine (VM).

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to regenerate the expired certificate through the Endpoint Protector console.
2. Restarted the virtual machine to see if access could be restored.
3. No further troubleshooting steps were documented prior to resolution.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the failure of the certificate regeneration process, which left the system in a state where access to the console was denied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by uploading the certificates again from the backend. This action restored access to the Endpoint Protector console.

## Notes
- Ensure that certificates are renewed before expiration to avoid similar access issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to have a backup of the current certificates before attempting any regeneration or updates.
