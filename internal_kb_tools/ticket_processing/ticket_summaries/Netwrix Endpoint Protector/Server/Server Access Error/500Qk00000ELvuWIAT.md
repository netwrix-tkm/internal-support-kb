## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ELvuWIAT
- **Case Number:** 417904
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** 17.1

## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported that the EPP console login UI freezes for one minute after entering an incorrect password. The server displays an error message stating, "Unfortunately, the login process encountered an error. Please try again," requiring the user to wait before attempting to log in again.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Server:** Specific server details not provided, but the issue was observed in the EPP UI.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by attempting to log in with an incorrect password in the EPP UI.
2. Compared the behavior with the expected outcome, which should only display "The username or password you entered is incorrect" without freezing.
3. Gathered additional information from the customer regarding their environment and any recent changes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, the freezing behavior appears to be specific to the customer's environment, as the EPP UI did not exhibit the same issue when tested in a different setup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the customer, indicating that they may have implemented a workaround or configuration change that addressed the freezing behavior. No specific solution steps were documented.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the freezing issue may not be a widespread problem, as it did not occur in the support technician's testing environment.
- Future support technicians should consider checking for any unique configurations or environmental factors that may contribute to similar issues in customer environments.
