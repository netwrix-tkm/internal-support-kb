## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M9JgJIAV
- **Case Number:** 436576
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreStack
- **Contact Name:** Nayan Rajore
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the Netwrix EPP server starting from 11 AM IST on the day of the incident. This server is critical as it is part of their production environment.

## Environment Details
- **Customer:** CD Cloud Enablers (Corestack)
- **EPP Server URL:** [Netwrix EPP Server](https://1fxchun.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to connect to the backend of the EPP server but could not establish a connection.
2. Restarted the server, which restored access to the user interface (UI).
3. Increased server resources as advised by Leroy Luff, who noted that the existing resources were insufficient to accommodate 400 users.

## Root Cause
The exact root cause of the initial access issue was not identified. However, it was determined that the server resources were inadequate for the number of users, which likely contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a restart of the server, which restored access to the UI. Additionally, increasing the server resources helped ensure that it could handle the load of 400 users effectively.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor server resource usage, especially in production environments with a high number of users, to prevent similar access issues in the future.
- Regular maintenance and resource assessments should be conducted to ensure optimal performance of the EPP server.
