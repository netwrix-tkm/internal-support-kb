## Problem Description
The customer, AsiaBank, reported receiving an "ERROR 502 Bad Gateway nginx" message after upgrading their EPP server. The issue arose two days post-upgrade, leading to server downtime that required a reboot through the hypervisor to temporarily resolve.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.1
- PHP-FPM service was down.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment**: Confirmed the issue with the customer and noted the server was down.
2. **Remote Session**: Conducted a remote session to perform server optimization and restart the PHP-FPM service.
3. **Monitoring**: Advised the customer to monitor the server for a few days after the initial fix.
4. **Configuration Changes**: Increased PHP memory limit to 512M and decreased MySQL memory to 3G.
5. **Follow-Up Sessions**: Scheduled additional remote sessions to apply further troubleshooting steps provided by the R&D team.
6. **Data Migration**: Assisted the customer in migrating data with System Backup v2 to a new machine.
7. **Issue Reoccurrence**: The issue reappeared on the new server, prompting further investigation and updates to the ADO.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the PHP-FPM service crashing, likely due to high resource usage on the server. This led to the server becoming inaccessible and returning the 502 Bad Gateway error.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Restarting the PHP-FPM service, which allowed access to the EPP UI.
- Increasing the PHP memory limit to 512M to accommodate the server's workload.
- Monitoring the server for a few days to ensure stability.
- Conducting a successful migration of data to a new server, which initially resolved the issue but later required additional monitoring.

## Notes
- The customer reported that they stopped using the tool due to the recurring issues and were considering a proof of concept for a competitive product.
- It is crucial to monitor resource usage on the server and adjust PHP configurations accordingly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure to keep backups and snapshots before making significant changes to the server configuration.
