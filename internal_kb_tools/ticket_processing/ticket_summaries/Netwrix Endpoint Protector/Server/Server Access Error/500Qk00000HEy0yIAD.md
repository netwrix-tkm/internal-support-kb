## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HEy0yIAD
- **Case Number:** 424461
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motorola Solutions Inc
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Harris
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an urgent issue where, after rebooting the Endpoint Protector server, it obtained a DHCP address instead of the configured static IP address. Attempts to revert to the static IP resulted in an "invalid gateway" error, despite the customer being confident that the gateway was correct. The appliance was inaccessible, and the solution was air-gapped, preventing screensharing.

## Environment Details
- The solution is air-gapped, meaning no external network access is available for troubleshooting.
- The issue occurred on a virtual machine running a Linux-based operating system.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to change the IP address back to static but encountered an "invalid gateway" error.
2. Verified the correctness of the gateway configuration.
3. Explored potential network interface naming issues due to the reboot.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration of the network interface naming after the reboot, which was likely influenced by the system's handling of network interfaces in the Linux environment.

## Solution
The customer successfully resolved the issue by loading the virtual machine in a Linux environment and executing the following steps:
1. Removed conflicting udev rules:
   ```bash
   rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70*
   ```
2. Edited the GRUB configuration to disable predictable network interface names:
   ```bash
   vim /etc/default/grub
   ```
   - Added `net.ifnames=0` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line.
3. Updated GRUB and rebooted the appliance:
   ```bash
   update-grub
   reboot
   ```
4. After rebooting, verified that the network interfaces were correctly named and configured.

## Notes
- If similar issues arise in the future, the following steps can be used to address network interface naming problems:
  - Remove conflicting udev rules.
  - Modify the GRUB configuration to disable predictable network interface names.
  - Always ensure to update GRUB and reboot the system after making changes.
- It is advisable to document any changes made to the network configuration for future reference.
