## Problem Description
The customer reported a critical vulnerability detected by their vulnerability scanner, Outpost24, indicating that their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server is using Ext JS version 2.0.2, which reached end-of-life on December 31, 2012, and is no longer supported by the vendor.

## Environment Details
- **Vulnerability Scanner:** Outpost24
- **Affected Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Vulnerable Component:** Ext JS 2.0.2

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Discussed potential upgrade options with the client.
4. Advised the client to upgrade the EPP server and apply the latest security updates.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the use of an outdated version of Ext JS (2.0.2), which had reached its end-of-life in 2012 and is no longer supported by the vendor. This lack of support led to the identification of critical vulnerabilities by the client's vulnerability scanner.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the client upgraded their Endpoint Protector server to a supported version and applied all necessary security updates. This action eliminated the critical vulnerability reported by the scanner.

## Notes
- It is crucial for clients to keep their software updated to avoid vulnerabilities associated with unsupported versions.
- Regular vulnerability scans should be conducted to identify and address potential security issues promptly.
- Future clients should be informed about the importance of maintaining software support and the risks associated with using outdated components.
