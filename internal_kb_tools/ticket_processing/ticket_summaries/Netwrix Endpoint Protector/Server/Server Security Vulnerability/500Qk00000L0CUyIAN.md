- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Endpoint Protector server, running version 5.9.4.0, was not connected to the internet and requested an offline update file to upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 due to identified vulnerabilities.

## Environment Details
- The server is operating in an offline environment, which restricts direct internet access for updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Informed the customer that an offline patch for version 5.9.4.1 was not yet available.
3. Documented the need for the offline patch and communicated the next steps to the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's server being in an offline environment, which prevented them from accessing the internet to download the necessary update. Additionally, the offline patch for version 5.9.4.1 had not been released at the time of the request.

## Solution
Once the offline patch for version 5.9.4.1 became available, it was sent to the customer along with a guide for installation. This resolved the customer's issue, allowing them to upgrade their Endpoint Protector server.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor for the release of offline patches for future updates, especially for customers operating in offline environments.
- It is important to communicate clearly with customers about the availability of updates and any limitations related to their environment.
