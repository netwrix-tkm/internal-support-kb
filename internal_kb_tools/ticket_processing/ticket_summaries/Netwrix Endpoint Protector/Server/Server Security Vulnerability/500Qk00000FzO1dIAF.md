- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported several critical security vulnerabilities on their AWS-hosted EPP server, specifically an OpenSSH regression vulnerability. They were unable to find available updates on the dashboard and expressed concerns about updating the server due to a previous incident where the server became unbootable.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** AWS-hosted EPP server
- **Vulnerability Identified:** OpenSSH regression vulnerability
- **Recommended Action:** Update the package to version 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.10 or higher using the command `apt upgrade openssh-sftp-server`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to run the following commands to update OpenSSH:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install --no-install-recommends openssh-server openssh-client
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```
2. The customer reported that after executing the commands, there were still some backend updates pending.
3. The support team confirmed that it was normal for backend updates to be displayed and instructed the customer to apply them from the UI or follow the manual procedure for backend security updates.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from an outdated version of OpenSSH on the server, which was flagged as a critical vulnerability by the security tool Wiz. The customer's previous experience with server updates led to hesitation in applying necessary updates.

## Solution
The resolution involved applying backend security updates related to the OpenSSH vulnerability. The customer successfully executed the recommended commands, which addressed the vulnerability without causing any issues with server bootability.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all backend updates are applied regularly to avoid similar vulnerabilities in the future.
- Customers should be encouraged to back up their systems before applying updates, especially if they have experienced issues in the past.
- Documenting the update process and any encountered issues can help in troubleshooting future cases.
