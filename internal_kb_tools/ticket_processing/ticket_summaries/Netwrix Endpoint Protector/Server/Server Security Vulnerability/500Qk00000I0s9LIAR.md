## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I0s9LIAR
- **Case Number:** 426414
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Insight Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Alex Alexander
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported vulnerabilities identified during an audit, specifically concerning open ports and internal IP disclosures. The findings included:
1. Open ports 80 and 443.
2. Internal IP disclosure on port 80.
3. SSL self-signed certificate revealing internal IP on port 443.

## Environment Details
- The device in question is configured to use a self-signed SSL certificate.
- The internal IP address disclosed was 10.200.1.18.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server version with the customer to check for any patches related to the reported issues.
2. Attempted to reproduce the issue with the "Content-location http header" but did not see the header appear.
3. Suggested the customer create and apply their own SSL certificate to mitigate the self-signed certificate issue.
4. Engaged the engineering team to assess the internal IP disclosure issue.

## Root Cause
The vulnerabilities were primarily due to the use of a self-signed SSL certificate, which does not provide adequate security and can expose internal IP addresses. Additionally, the web server configuration was set to disclose specific information through HTTP headers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a valid SSL certificate from a known Certificate Authority (CA) to the server, which eliminated the errors related to the self-signed certificate. The customer was advised to configure their web servers to prevent the disclosure of internal IP addresses in HTTP headers.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always use SSL certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities to avoid similar vulnerabilities.
- Ensure web server configurations are reviewed regularly to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Follow up with the security team for any ongoing concerns related to internal IP disclosures.
