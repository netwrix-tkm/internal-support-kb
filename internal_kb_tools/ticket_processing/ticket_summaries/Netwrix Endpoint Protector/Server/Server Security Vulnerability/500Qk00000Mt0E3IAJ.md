## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Mt0E3IAJ
- **Case Number:** 438685
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PSI CRO AG
- **Contact Name:** Jovan Salsone
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server was scanned by Tenable, revealing a total of 253 vulnerabilities, including several critical ones. They inquired whether assistance was needed for patching these vulnerabilities or if they could use the secondary root account provided by Netwrix.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the server using Putty with support from Andre Pop.
2. Attempted to apply patches manually.
3. Tested for available patches again, receiving a message indicating no available patches.
4. Reviewed the scan results, which indicated 28 critical vulnerabilities.
5. Confirmed that the latest version of Endpoint Protector was installed and that backend security updates were checked.
6. Advised the customer to run another Tenable scan after applying backend updates.
7. Scheduled a remote session to assist further with troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The initial vulnerabilities were due to outdated software and unpatched backend security updates on the Endpoint Protector server. Despite applying some patches, the system still reported vulnerabilities due to additional backend updates that were not applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Applying the necessary backend security updates after confirming the system was running the latest version of Endpoint Protector.
2. Conducting a follow-up scan to verify that the vulnerabilities were addressed.
3. Closing the ticket once the customer confirmed that the vulnerabilities were resolved.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that all backend security updates are applied after any major version updates to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Always confirm the version of the software and the operating system before proceeding with troubleshooting.
- For future cases, ensure that a snapshot of the EPP appliance is created before applying updates, as this provides a rollback option in case of issues.
