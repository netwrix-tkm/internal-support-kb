- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Offline patch)

## Problem Description
The customer reported a security vulnerability identified during penetration testing, specifically regarding default or easily guessable database user credentials in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) application. The inability to SSH into the EPP appliance prevented the customer from changing these credentials to more secure options.

## Environment Details

2. Confirmed that SSH access to the EPP appliance was not available for credential changes.
3. Engaged with the development team to discuss potential solutions and upcoming patches.
4. Monitored the status of the 5941 Offline patch, which was expected to address the identified vulnerabilities.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the use of default or easily guessable database user credentials within the EPP application, which posed a significant security risk. The inability to access the appliance via SSH further complicated the situation, preventing immediate remediation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the 5941 Offline patch, which included enhancements related to database security, including improvements to password handling. This patch allowed the customer to validate the changes and ensure that the vulnerabilities were addressed.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to change default credentials and implement a strong password policy to mitigate security risks.
- Future updates to the EPP application should be monitored closely for improvements related to security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure SSH access is configured correctly to allow for necessary administrative changes in the future.
