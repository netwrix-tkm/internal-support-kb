## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CPwLHIA1
- **Case Number:** 413406
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Privatbanka, a.s.
- **Contact Name:** Jan Andrasko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0 and Hotfix 1.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Privatbanka, reported that after applying an offline patch (ADV-2024-002) to their airgapped EPP server, there was no indication in the GUI that the patch had been successfully applied.

## Environment Details
- The server is airgapped, meaning it does not have internet access.
- The customer applied offline patches up to version 5.9.3.0 and the security hotfix 1.1.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the customer to check for the patch under `Dashboard > Live Update > View Applied EPP Software Updates`.
2. Confirmed that the customer could not see the expected button on the Live Update page, possibly due to the airgapped nature of their server.
3. Investigated if the customer had completed the preliminary steps required for accessing the View Applied Patches menu.
4. Discussed the need for a remote session to check the backend of the server if necessary.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer not completing the preliminary step of filling in the Administrator fields and sending the request before moving the appliance to an airgapped network. This prevented access to the View Applied Patches button/menu.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the customer needed to ensure all preliminary steps were completed prior to moving the appliance to an airgapped environment. A remote session was scheduled to check the backend of the server for further verification.

## Notes
- It is important for customers operating in airgapped environments to complete all necessary setup steps before disconnecting from the network.
- Future hotfixes may have limitations; for instance, reports indicated that Hotfix #1 could cause the system to cease processing certain events, leading to a temporary pause in its distribution.
- Always verify the completion of preliminary setup steps when dealing with airgapped systems to avoid similar issues.
