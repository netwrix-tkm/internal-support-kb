- **Case Number:** 413404
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Rajesh Makwana
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue regarding the application of a hotfix firmware update related to Security Advisory â€“ ADV-2024-002, which addresses remote code execution vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify. Despite successfully applying the update from the DLP server console, the system continued to prompt for the update again.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The customer had already followed the necessary steps for the firmware update as per the security advisory.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to apply the firmware update multiple times, each time receiving a confirmation that the update was successful.
2. The customer logged out and logged back into the console to verify the update status.
3. Technical support suggested refreshing the web browser and checking if the update prompt persisted.
4. Support advised the customer to monitor the situation until the following Monday before taking further action.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a known behavior where the update prompt would continue to appear until the EPP server was updated to version 5.9.4.0. The engineering team confirmed that the update notification would disappear after this version was released.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that they should not reapply the patch and to monitor the situation until the next server update (version 5.9.4.0) was available. The customer was also provided with a link to download the offline patch for distribution to their customers.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to check for any pending server updates that may resolve persistent update prompts.
- It is important to communicate clearly that the appearance of the update prompt does not necessarily indicate that the update has failed, especially if the update was confirmed as applied successfully.
- Future updates should be monitored closely, and customers should be informed of any known behaviors related to update notifications.
