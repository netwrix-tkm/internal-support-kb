- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ernst & Young USA
- **Contact Name:** Doug Russell
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
A security vulnerability was identified due to deprecated cryptographic settings in the SSH configuration, which could potentially allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to exploit the system and decrypt session keys and messages.

## Environment Details
- The issue was reported on an EPP Server running Ubuntu.
- The SSH configuration file in question is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the SSH configuration settings for deprecated cryptographic algorithms.
2. Identified deprecated ciphers and key exchange algorithms that were still in use.
3. Conducted a remote session to modify the SSH configuration.
4. Commented out an outdated line in the configuration and added recommended secure settings.
5. Restarted the SSH service using the command:
   ```bash
   service ssh restart
   ```
6. Followed up with the customer to confirm if the changes resolved the vulnerability.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the use of deprecated cryptographic settings in the SSH configuration, which included insecure ciphers and key exchange algorithms that are no longer considered secure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the SSH configuration file to use secure ciphers and MACs as follows:
```bash
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
```
After making these changes, the SSH service was restarted to apply the new settings.

## Notes
- It is crucial to avoid using deprecated cryptographic settings in SSH configurations to maintain security.
- Future configurations should adhere to best practices as outlined in the NIST publication on SSH security.
- Regular audits of cryptographic settings should be performed to ensure compliance with current security standards.
