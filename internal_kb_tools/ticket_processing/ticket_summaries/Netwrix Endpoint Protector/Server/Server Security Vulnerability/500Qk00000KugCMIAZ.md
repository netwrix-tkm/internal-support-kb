- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AutoFi
- **Contact Name:** Jayme Villafranca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer sought clarification on credential updates mentioned in the security advisory ADV-2025-001 after upgrading their CoSoSys-hosted server to the patched version 5.9.4.1. They wanted to know if the recommended credential updates applied only to configurations in the Endpoint Protector ADMIN portal or if they also affected credentials used by end users on their macOS devices.

## Environment Details
- The customer uses Endpoint Protector exclusively on end-user macOS devices.
- No Endpoint Protector is running on servers or Windows devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer upgraded their CoSoSys-hosted server to version 5.9.4.1 as per the advisory.
2. The customer inquired about the scope of the credential updates specified in the advisory.
3. The support team consulted the security team for clarification on the credential updates.

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from the advisory's language regarding credential updates, leading the customer to question whether these updates were necessary for local configurations on end-user devices.

## Solution
The security team provided clear answers confirming that the credential updates mentioned in the advisory were related solely to features configured in the Endpoint Protector ADMIN portal and did not apply to any credentials that end users may have interacted with on their endpoints. This clarification resolved the customer's concerns.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly the scope of security advisories to avoid confusion regarding their applicability to different environments.
- Future advisories should specify whether updates pertain to server-side configurations or if they also impact end-user configurations to prevent similar inquiries.
