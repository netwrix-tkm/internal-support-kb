## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ClU5OIAV
- **Case Number:** 414246
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Diakonie Herzogsägmühle Peiting
- **Contact Name:** Michael Ebert
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had installed a security update three times, but it still appeared as required in the system.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to install the security update multiple times.
2. Technical support confirmed that the option to install would remain in the list and could be ignored.
3. Support verified that the patch was being applied and could be confirmed in the list of applied updates.
4. Support provided links for updating the EPP clients for both MacOS and Windows.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to the system indicating that the update was still required even after multiple installations. This was a known behavior where the installation status did not refresh immediately in the user interface.

## Solution
A hotfix (adv-2024-002) was deployed to address the issue. The support team confirmed that the patch was successfully applied to the server. The customer was advised that they could ignore the installation prompt and that multiple applications of the patch would not cause any issues.

## Notes
- Customers should be informed that the installation prompt may remain visible even after successful updates; this is a UI refresh issue.
- It is important to ensure that EPP clients are also updated to maintain security compliance. Links for client updates were provided to the customer:
