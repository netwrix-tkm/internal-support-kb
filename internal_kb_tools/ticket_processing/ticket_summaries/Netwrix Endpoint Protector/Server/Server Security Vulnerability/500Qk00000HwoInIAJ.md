- **Case Number:** 426167
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a vulnerability identified during a vulnerability assessment (VA). They do not currently have a server certificate and need assistance in generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to obtain a certificate from their internal Certificate Authority (CA).

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP).
- The EPP server does not have a server certificate installed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was informed that to resolve the vulnerability, they need to paste the certificate information under "Appliance > Maintenance > Server Certificate".
2. Clarification was sought on whether the customer wanted to generate an SSL certificate from the EPP server.
3. The customer confirmed the intention to generate an SSL certificate and inquired about generating a CSR from the EPP server.
4. The support team clarified that EPP does not generate SSL certificates and provided guidance on obtaining a certificate signed by a trusted third-party CA.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the absence of a server certificate on the EPP server, which was necessary to address the identified vulnerability.

## Solution
The support team advised the customer to:
- Create a CSR from the EPP server to obtain a certificate from their internal CA.
- Once the certificate is created, navigate to the EPP UI and paste the certificate content in the "Appliance > Maintenance > Server Certificate" section.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the EPP server has a valid server certificate to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Future requests for CSR generation should clarify that EPP does not generate SSL certificates and that customers must obtain them from a trusted CA.
