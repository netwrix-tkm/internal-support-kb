## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue regarding the EPP client hotfix version 6.2.2.2005 related to a security advisory (ADV-2024-002). They successfully received an offline patch but were unable to locate the required EPP client version for installation.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using EPP clients on Ubuntu 22 with version 2.4.2.1 installed.
- The latest available version for the Ubuntu client was 2.4.2.1007.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was informed about the need to update the EPP client to version 6.2.2.2005.
2. The customer successfully downloaded updated EPP clients but encountered issues with the Ubuntu client.
3. The customer reported that after updating, the EPP console displayed duplicate entries for computers due to version discrepancies.
4. A request was made to increase the EPP client version to resolve the duplication issue.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a version mismatch between the installed EPP client (v2.4.2.1) and the latest version available (v2.4.2.1007). The console displayed the older version, leading to duplicate entries in the EPP console after the client updates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming the availability of the required EPP client version. The customer was advised to update the EPP client to the latest version (2.4.2.1007) to eliminate the duplication issue in the EPP console. The customer confirmed that the problem was resolved and the ticket could be closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that clients are updated to the latest version to avoid duplication issues in the EPP console.
- Always verify the version displayed in the console matches the installed version on endpoints to prevent confusion and potential support issues.
