## Problem Description
The customer reported a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-3094) affecting Linux systems and sought to verify if their hosted Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS system was impacted. They were unable to log into the Linux environment due to only having an initial password for the web interface.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS
- **VM Hosting:** The system is hosted as a virtual machine.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to log into the Linux environment but was unable to do so.
2. The support engineer suggested upgrading the server from Ubuntu 14.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 to mitigate the vulnerability.
3. The customer was guided to import a new VM image compatible with their Hyper-V version.
4. The customer faced issues with the VM import due to version compatibility with Hyper-V.
5. A remote session was scheduled to assist with the deinstallation of the vulnerable XZ Utils package.

## Root Cause
The initial version of the operating system (Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS) was outdated and vulnerable to the reported security issue. Additionally, the presence of an outdated version of XZ Utils (below 5.6.1) contributed to the vulnerability.

## Solution
- The server was successfully upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04.
- The XZ Utils package was removed from the server during a remote session.
- The customer confirmed that the necessary ciphers were now functioning correctly after the migration.

## Notes
- Ensure that all systems are regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- For future cases involving security vulnerabilities, consider recommending immediate upgrades to supported versions of operating systems.
- Maintain clear communication with customers regarding the importance of timely updates and the potential risks of using outdated software.
