- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cleerly
- **Contact Name:** Kenneth Bittala
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (ADV-2024-002) and inquired about the necessary steps to apply a hotfix (5.9.1.0) to their server and whether any updates were required for the agents before applying the hotfix.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted by Netwrix, and the customer has access only to the admin console.
- The current server version is 5.9.1.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer inquired about the need to patch agents before applying the server hotfix.
2. Technical support recommended either upgrading the server to 5.9.3.0 or applying the hotfix while keeping the server at 5.9.1.0.
3. Provided download links for the agents containing the fix for Windows and MacOS.
4. Advised the customer to hold off on applying the hotfix until further notice due to ongoing development of a new hotfix.
5. Confirmed that the server fix should be applied first, followed by the agents.
6. After the hotfix was released, the customer confirmed compatibility with their server version and proceeded with the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The initial concern was due to a vulnerability in the server software that required immediate attention through a hotfix. The confusion regarding the agent updates stemmed from previous experiences where agent updates were necessary before server updates.

## Solution
- The hotfix (adv-2024-002) was successfully deployed to the server.
- The agents were updated afterward, with specific instructions provided for both Windows and MacOS.
- The customer was informed that the hotfix is compatible with server versions 5.9.0.0 to 5.9.3.0.

## Notes
- It is crucial to apply the server hotfix before updating the agents.
- Ensure that any firewall settings allow communication through the necessary ports (443, 80, 22, 389) for the EPP services.
- If issues arise during agent deployment, check for potential content filtering on VPN firewalls that may block EPP services.
