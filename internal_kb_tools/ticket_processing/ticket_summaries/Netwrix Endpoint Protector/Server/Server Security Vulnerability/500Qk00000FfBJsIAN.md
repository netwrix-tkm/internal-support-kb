## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FfBJsIAN
- **Case Number:** 420783
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Value Labs
- **Contact Name:** secops Valuelabs
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported vulnerabilities identified in the External Vulnerability Assessment Report for the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector (EPP) server. The vulnerabilities included potential confidentiality compromise via static key ciphers, susceptibility to BREACH and LUCKY13 attacks, and leakage of sensitive information through Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the External VAPT report to understand the vulnerabilities listed.
2. Assessed the EPP server configuration for TLS/SSL settings.
3. Evaluated the use of static key ciphers and their impact on server security.
4. Investigated the server's vulnerability to BREACH and LUCKY13 attacks.
5. Confirmed the leakage of FQDN and its implications for sensitive information.

## Root Cause
The vulnerabilities were primarily due to the server's configuration allowing the use of static key ciphers and not implementing adequate protections against known attacks like BREACH and LUCKY13. Additionally, the server was not configured to prevent the leakage of sensitive information such as FQDN.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Updating the server's TLS/SSL configuration to disable static key ciphers.
- Implementing security measures to mitigate the risks associated with BREACH and LUCKY13 attacks.
- Configuring the server to prevent the leakage of sensitive information, including FQDN.

## Notes
- It is crucial to regularly review and update server security configurations to address emerging vulnerabilities.
- Future assessments should include a comprehensive review of TLS/SSL settings and cipher suites to ensure compliance with security best practices.
- Consider conducting periodic vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential security risks proactively.
