- **Case Number:** 413240
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SingleSource Property Solutions / V300 DC+CAP
- **Contact Name:** Matt Abbondanza
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they received a notification regarding security advisory ADV-2024-002, which indicated that a patch (Hotfix#1) was available via Live Update for their on-prem solution running version 5.9.3.0. However, upon checking for updates, the customer found that no updates were available.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Current Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer checked for updates via Live Update but found none available.
2. The support team requested the customer's time zone and availability for a remote session to apply the hotfix.
3. The customer later confirmed that the hotfix became available and was applied.
4. After applying the hotfix, the customer reported that it still showed as available despite being installed.
5. The customer rebooted the server, which resulted in all administrator accounts being unable to log in except for the root account.
6. A remote session was scheduled to address the login issue and verify the hotfix application.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a failure in the update process where the hotfix was not properly recognized as installed by the system, leading to confusion about its application status. Additionally, the reboot caused a lockout of administrator accounts, indicating a potential misconfiguration or issue with user permissions post-update.

## Solution
The support team conducted a remote session to troubleshoot the login issues and confirmed that the hotfix was indeed applied. They provided a revised version of the hotfix to address the logging issues that were reported. The customer was advised to apply this new patch, which resolved the logging issues and confirmed that alerts were being generated correctly.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that the issue with the hotfix showing as available despite being installed is a known issue that will be addressed in the next server version (5.9.4.0).
- It is recommended to always have a backup or snapshot before applying updates, especially when dealing with critical security patches, to prevent potential lockout scenarios.
