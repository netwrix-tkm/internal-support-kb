## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NoQetIAF
- **Case Number:** 441259
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** STRATO GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Christian Unger
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Nessus scanner indicated that the operating system on the Endpoint Protector (EPP) Appliance was Ubuntu 18.04.6, which is no longer supported (EOL). The customer expressed concern about the lack of options to upgrade the system due to it being an appliance and requested information on whether the system would continue to receive patches or how to upgrade to a supported OS.

## Environment Details
- The EPP Appliance is running on Hyper-V virtualization.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the support request and confirmed the EPP Appliance was running on Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS.
2. Offered a new image of Endpoint Protector based on Ubuntu 22.04 and support for migrating the configuration using System Backup V2.
3. Confirmed the virtualization environment (Hyper-V) with the customer.
4. Provided the customer with a link to download the new virtual appliance image.
5. Scheduled a migration session to assist with the configuration and backup import.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the use of an outdated operating system (Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS) on the EPP Appliance, which had reached its end of life and was no longer receiving security updates or support.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Providing the customer with a new virtual appliance image of Endpoint Protector running on Ubuntu 22.04.
2. Assisting the customer in migrating their configuration (excluding logs and shadows) to the new appliance using System Backup V2.
3. Successfully completing the migration process, which was confirmed by the customer.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the importance of keeping their operating systems up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Future migrations should be planned in advance, and customers should be informed about the potential downtime during the migration process.
- It is advisable to check for any minor version updates (e.g., from 5.9.4.1 to 5.9.4.1) that may need to be applied during the migration to ensure compatibility and security.
