- **Case Number:** 439267
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liebherr IbÃ©rica, S.L.
- **Contact Name:** Victor Delgado
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested to change the LDAP security settings to ensure that the connection is signed. They indicated that the current configuration would not work after April 1st unless the LDAP client settings were updated to support signed connections.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using LDAP to connect admin users to the Endpoint Protector (EPP) UI for management purposes.
- The existing LDAP integration with EPP was confirmed to be operational.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to clarify the request regarding signed LDAP security.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the LDAP integration further.
3. Verified the Active Directory (AD) integration status, which was confirmed to be functioning.
4. Discussed the need for a new configuration for the LDAP server and the implications of the upcoming changes.
5. Provided instructions on how to secure the EPP UI by importing an SSL certificate under the Appliance section - Server Maintenance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the requirement for the LDAP connection to be signed, as mandated by the customer's LDAP manager. The existing configuration did not support signed connections, which would lead to a failure in authentication after the specified date.

## Solution
The customer was advised to:
- Change their LDAP settings to configure the new LDAPS server.
- Generate a new SSL certificate and import it into the EPP UI under the Appliance menu > Server Maintenance.
- Confirm the new configuration internally and ensure that the integration with EPP is updated accordingly.

The customer reported that after changing the settings for the new LDAPS server, the connection was working. They planned to verify the functionality further by the following Friday.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any LDAP configurations are compliant with security requirements, especially when changes are mandated by external parties.
- Follow up with the customer after a specified period to confirm that the changes have resolved the issue and that no further assistance is needed.
- If similar issues arise, ensure to check the LDAP integration status and any upcoming changes in security requirements.
