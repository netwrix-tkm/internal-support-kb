## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with applying an offline patch to the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector server to address vulnerabilities related to remote code execution.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer reported the need for an offline patch to address vulnerabilities (ADV-2024-002) in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector.
2. Netwrix Support informed the customer about issues with the initial hotfix deployment, which caused the system to stop processing certain events.
3. The distribution of the hotfix was paused until a revised version could be made available.
4. The customer was advised to wait for the revised hotfix and ensure a snapshot was created before applying any updates.
5. Once the revised hotfix was released, a remote session was scheduled to apply the patch.

## Root Cause
The initial hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector caused the system to cease processing certain events, leading to the decision to pause its distribution until a revised version could be provided.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully applying the offline patches to the server after the revised hotfix was released. The server was updated without further complications.

## Notes
- Ensure that a snapshot of the server is created before applying any patches or updates to prevent data loss.
- Monitor for any further issues related to hotfix deployments, as previous versions may have unintended side effects.
