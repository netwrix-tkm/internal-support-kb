- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hughes Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Zach Metz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Security Vulnerability
- **Version:** 6.0.1.6 or above

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their server was vulnerable to the ADV-2024-002 vulnerability. They scheduled a hotfix but needed confirmation on the compatibility and deployment of agents on all endpoints.

## Environment Details
- All endpoints were running version 6.0.1.6 or above.
- The customer was using automated deployment software for agent installation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided download links for the latest agents containing the fix:
   - MacOS: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar)
   - Windows: [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip)
2. Clarified installation procedures:
   - For macOS, agents can be installed over existing versions.
   - For Windows, recommended process: Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install new version.
3. Suggested testing the installation on a small group of computers before a full rollout.
4. Addressed concerns regarding a persistent update notification in the console.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to apply a hotfix for the ADV-2024-002 vulnerability, which required updated agents on the endpoints. The confusion regarding the update notification was due to a non-versioned patch that could be applied multiple times.

## Solution
- Deployed the hotfix (ADV-2024-002) on the server.
- Provided the updated EPP clients containing the hotfix for both MacOS and Windows.
- Conducted a remote session with the customer to ensure proper installation and functionality of the hotfix.

## Notes
- The persistent update notification in the console can be ignored as it relates to a non-versioned patch.
- Customers should be advised to hold off on upgrading EPP clients or reapplying the vulnerability patch until further notice from support.
- Future installations should follow the recommended uninstall and reboot process for Windows to avoid issues.
