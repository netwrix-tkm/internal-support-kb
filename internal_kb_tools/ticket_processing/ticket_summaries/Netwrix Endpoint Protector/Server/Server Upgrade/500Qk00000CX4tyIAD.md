## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CX4tyIAD
- **Case Number:** 413644
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer needed to upgrade their Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server from version 5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0 without internet access, as the server is a marine air-gapped machine.

## Environment Details
- The server is configured to be air-gapped, meaning it cannot access the internet.
- The customer had partitioning enabled on their server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a snapshot of the EPP server for backup.
2. Verified available disk space; identified that a previous low disk space message was due to a bug in version 5.8.1.0, which was resolved in version 5.9.0.0.
3. Upgraded the EPP server through offline patches in the following order:
   - 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
   - 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
   - 5.7.1.0 to 5.8.0.0
   - 5.8.0.0 to 5.8.1.0
   - 5.8.1.0 to 5.9.0.0
   - 5.9.0.0 to 5.9.1.0
   - 5.9.1.0 to 5.9.2.0
   - 5.9.2.0 to 5.9.3.0
4. Applied the offline server vulnerability patch.
5. Applied the offline client vulnerability patch.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the need to upgrade the EPP server without internet access, compounded by a previous bug in version 5.8.1.0 that incorrectly reported low disk space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully upgrading the EPP server through a series of offline patches, ensuring that each version was applied in the correct order. The final step involved deploying the hotfix adv-2024-002 to maintain server health.

## Notes
- Always create a snapshot of the server before starting the upgrade process.
- Ensure that all patches are downloaded and available offline before beginning the upgrade.
- For future upgrades, follow the version upgrade path strictly to avoid issues related to compatibility or bugs in intermediate versions.
