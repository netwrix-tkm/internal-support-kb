- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether they needed an active Device Control license to continue updating their Endpoint Protector test server, which is used solely for server updates and upgrades prior to deployment in production. The current license was set to expire soon.

## Environment Details
- **Server Type:** Endpoint Protector test server
- **License Type:** Device Control

2. Reached out to Team Lead and Sara Hall for guidance.
3. Involved the Customer Success Team in the email thread.
4. Customer Success issued a temporary extension license to the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's uncertainty regarding the necessity of an active license for performing updates on a test server, which is not typically required for non-production environments.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the Customer Success Team providing the customer with a temporary extension license, allowing them to continue updates on their test server without interruption.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to customers that test servers may not require active licenses for updates, especially if they are not being used in a production capacity.
- Future inquiries regarding licensing for test environments should be directed to the Customer Success Team for potential temporary solutions.
