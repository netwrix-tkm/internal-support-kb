- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KX3rjIAD
- **Case Number:** 431810
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** InnoMaint - Vijay Global Services
- **Contact Name:** Sivakumar Manoharan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to upgrade their server using an offline patch update. The upgrade process failed with an error message stating, "Cannot apply patch, wrong version." Additionally, there were issues with policy mapping to endpoints, which posed a risk to data protection.

## Environment Details
- The EPP Server is hosted on the AWS platform.
- The customer confirmed that no proxy server was being used.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message during the upgrade attempt.
2. Checked the Inodes and removed all file shadows.
3. Applied all backend security updates.
4. Confirmed that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were open and responsive.
5. Investigated the possibility of a proxy or firewall interfering with the connection to the live update server.
6. Conducted a remote session to troubleshoot the issue further.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to incorrect proxy settings in the user interface, which interfered with the connection to the live update server. This caused the live update page to time out and prevented the application of the patch.

## Solution
Disabling the proxy settings in the user interface resolved the issue, allowing the customer to successfully upgrade their EPP Server to version 5.9.4.1.

## Notes
- Ensure that proxy settings are correctly configured in the UI when troubleshooting similar upgrade issues.
- Always verify that the necessary ports are open and that there are no firewalls or proxies interfering with server communications.
- Document any changes made during troubleshooting for future reference.
