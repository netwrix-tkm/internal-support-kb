## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E0k2pIAB
- **Case Number:** 417027
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported uncertainty regarding the application of an offline hotfix on their EPP server. They attempted to apply the hotfix but found no clear indication that the update was successful.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Server Logs:** Admin Actions logs were checked for indications of the hotfix application.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to apply the offline hotfix.
2. They reviewed the EPP Server's logs under Admin Actions.
3. They located the log entry for "applyManualPatch."
4. They examined the log details, noting that the "Before" value was empty and the "After" value pointed to a specific manual patch file.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clear feedback in the server logs regarding the successful application of the offline hotfix. The empty "Before" value indicated that there was no previous version to compare against, leading to confusion about whether the hotfix was applied.

## Solution
The support team confirmed that the manual patch version indicated in the logs could be used to justify that the hotfix had been applied to the EPP server. The customer was advised to consider the log entry as confirmation of the successful application of the hotfix.

## Notes
- It is important for future reference to ensure that logs provide clear indications of version changes after applying hotfixes to avoid confusion.
- Customers should be encouraged to check log entries thoroughly and reach out for clarification if they encounter ambiguous log messages.
