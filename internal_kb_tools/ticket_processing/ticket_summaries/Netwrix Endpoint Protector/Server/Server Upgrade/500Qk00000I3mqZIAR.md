## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with their Server appliance failing to apply updates, receiving the error message: "An error occurred. Hash does not match."

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred during an attempt to upgrade the Server appliance.
- The customer was using version 5.9.4.0 of the software.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to apply updates through the standard update process but encountered the hash mismatch error.
2. The support engineer, Iosif Muntean, suggested scheduling a remote session to investigate further.
3. An offline patch was provided to the customer for the latest server update.
4. The customer was instructed on how to apply the offline patch:
   - Download the patch without extracting the files.
   - Navigate to Dashboard -> Live Updates and click on Offline Patch Uploader.
   - Select the downloaded file and click the Upload Patch button.
   - Wait for a confirmation message before checking if the update starts.
5. The customer reported that they still encountered the same error after applying the patch.
6. The support engineer recommended rebooting the EPP Server and trying the update process again.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a hash mismatch during the update process, which can occur due to corrupted update files or issues with the update mechanism itself.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing an offline patch that the customer successfully applied. After applying the patch and rebooting the server, the customer confirmed that the version showed as updated, despite initially receiving a failure message.

## Notes
- Ensure that the customer follows the instructions carefully when applying offline patches, including not extracting the files.
- It is advisable to reboot the server after applying updates to ensure that all changes take effect properly.
- Future cases involving hash mismatch errors should consider checking for file integrity and providing offline patches as a potential solution.
