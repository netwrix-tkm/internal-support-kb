## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JpsLDIAZ
- **Case Number:** 430596
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Addleshaw Goddard LLP
- **Contact Name:** Sean Reilly
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to upgrade the Ubuntu OS version for their Endpoint Protector (EPP) Server. They were advised by a support agent that a call would be necessary to facilitate this upgrade.

## Environment Details
- The upgrade was to be performed on a virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu OS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's request for an Ubuntu OS upgrade.
2. Investigated the possibility of performing the upgrade directly on the existing VM.
3. Determined that the Ubuntu upgrade could not be performed on the VM.
4. Identified that a new image with a newer Ubuntu OS would need to be installed, followed by a migration process.

## Root Cause
The inability to upgrade the existing Ubuntu OS on the VM was due to limitations in the virtual environment that prevented direct upgrades.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that:
- A new image with a newer version of Ubuntu OS must be installed.
- The migration to the new instance would be necessary.
- The ticket was closed with the understanding that the customer could reopen it or create a new ticket when they were ready to proceed with the migration.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that direct upgrades may not be possible in certain virtual environments and that a fresh installation followed by migration is often required.
- Ensure to schedule follow-up calls or support as needed when the customer is ready to proceed with the upgrade.
