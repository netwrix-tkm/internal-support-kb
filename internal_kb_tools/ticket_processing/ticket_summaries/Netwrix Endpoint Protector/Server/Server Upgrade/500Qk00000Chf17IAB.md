## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Chf17IAB
- **Case Number:** 414193
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust
- **Contact Name:** David Rolfe
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

## Problem Description
The customer, David Rolfe, reported that after successfully applying the 'Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 – Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)', the console still indicated that the patch needed to be applied again. David was unsure if the patch had been successfully applied despite it appearing in the list of applied patches.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted by CoSoSys and runs on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer confirmed the application of the hotfix.
2. Customer checked the console for the status of the patch.
3. Technical support confirmed that if the patch appears in the applied patches list, it was successfully applied.
4. Technical support informed the customer that the availability of the patch would remain in the "Check Now" list until the next patch release (5.9.4.0).

## Root Cause
The issue was due to the design of the console, which continues to display the patch in the "Check Now" list even after it has been successfully applied. This behavior is expected until a subsequent patch is released.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that the patch was indeed applied successfully, as indicated by its presence in the applied patches list. The technical support team reassured the customer that the patch would remain visible in the console until the next version was released.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that the console may continue to show previously applied patches until a new version is released. This is a normal behavior and does not indicate a failure in the patch application process.
- Future communications should clarify this behavior to prevent confusion among users regarding patch status.
