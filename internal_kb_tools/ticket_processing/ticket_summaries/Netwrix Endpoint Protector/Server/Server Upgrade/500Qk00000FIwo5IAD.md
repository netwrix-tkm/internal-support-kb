## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FIwo5IAD
- **Case Number:** 419938
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Black Sesame Technologies Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Helin Lu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server upgrade to version 5.9.4 was stuck at 75% completion. They requested assistance to identify the cause of the issue and to find a resolution.

## Environment Details
- The server was running a previous version of EPP prior to the upgrade attempt.
- The database size was approximately 15 GB, which could impact the upgrade process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment:** The support team reviewed the upgrade logs and confirmed that the process was still ongoing without any error messages.
2. **Database Size Check:** The team advised the customer to check the database size, as large databases can prolong the upgrade process.
3. **Remote Sessions:** Multiple remote sessions were scheduled to investigate the issue further, during which logs were gathered and analyzed.
4. **Log File Review:** The customer was asked to provide additional log files for further analysis.
5. **Database Restoration:** The support team suggested restoring the database from a backup to see if that would allow the upgrade to proceed.
6. **Reapplication of Upgrade:** After restoring the database, the upgrade to version 5.9.4 was reapplied.

## Root Cause
The upgrade process was likely hindered by the large database size and possibly corrupted or incomplete database entries that caused the upgrade to hang at 75%. The MySQL server connection issues were also a contributing factor.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by restoring the database from a backup and then successfully applying the upgrade to version 5.9.4.0. The support team confirmed that the upgrade completed successfully during the final remote session.

## Notes
- For future upgrades, it is recommended to ensure that the database is optimized and to monitor its size, especially if it is large.
- If similar issues arise, consider restoring from a backup and reattempting the upgrade.
- Always check for MySQL server connection stability and log any errors encountered during the upgrade process for further analysis.
