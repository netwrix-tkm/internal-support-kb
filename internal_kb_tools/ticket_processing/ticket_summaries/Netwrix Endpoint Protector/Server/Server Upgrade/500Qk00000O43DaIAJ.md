## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were using an outdated server version (Ubuntu 18.04) and wanted to update the Epp server operating system.

## Environment Details
- The server was running an older version of Ubuntu (18.04).
- The customer required a migration to a newer version of Ubuntu as the existing OS could not be upgraded directly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to clarify whether they wanted to upgrade or migrate the server.
2. Confirmed that a migration was necessary since the OS could not be upgraded.
3. Suggested a remote connection to assist with the migration process.
4. Provided detailed steps for the migration, including:
   - Downloading the new VM.
   - Importing it into the environment.
   - Updating both Epp servers to the new version.
   - Creating a backup on the old server.
   - Importing the backup into the new server.
   - Verifying the migration and updating the IP address.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the outdated server operating system (Ubuntu 18.04) that could not be upgraded directly, necessitating a migration to a newer version.

## Solution
The server was successfully migrated to a newer version of Ubuntu. The following steps were taken to resolve the issue:
- The customer followed the provided migration steps, which included downloading the new VM, importing it, and performing the necessary updates and backups.
- After completing the migration, the customer confirmed that everything was up and running smoothly.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that a snapshot of the VM is created before performing any updates to allow for recovery in case of issues.
- Customers should be informed that self-signed certificates may not be backed up and restored automatically; they need to be managed separately.
- Future migrations should always verify that the new server is fully operational before decommissioning the old server.
