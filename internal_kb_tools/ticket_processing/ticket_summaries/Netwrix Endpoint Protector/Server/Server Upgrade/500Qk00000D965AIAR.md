## Problem Description
The customer requested a revised hotfix for ADV-2024-002, which addresses remote code execution vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify.

## Environment Details
- The customer's server is airgapped and does not have internet access, which necessitated a manual download of the hotfix.

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Provided instructions for applying the patch via the dashboard.
3. Received a follow-up from the customer indicating that their server was airgapped and requested an offline version of the hotfix.
4. Supplied the customer with links to download the offline patches for both the EPP Server and the EPP Clients.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the customer's inability to access the internet, which prevented them from downloading the hotfix through the standard update process.
