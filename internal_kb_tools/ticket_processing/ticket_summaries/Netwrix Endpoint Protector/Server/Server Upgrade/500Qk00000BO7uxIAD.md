## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to view updates on their open tickets in the Salesforce UI, specifically regarding ticket number 00409840. The ticket was marked as "on hold," and the customer could not see any comments or provide feedback due to a broken link.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Salesforce ticketing platform transition.
- The server had multiple critical vulnerabilities related to OpenSSL, with the earliest reported vulnerability dating back to January.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue with the customer regarding the visibility of updates and comments on the ticket.
2. Raised the issue with Cristian and the Salesforce IT team.
3. Informed the customer that the ticket remains active and that a new image release is pending to address the vulnerabilities.
4. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to further investigate the issue.
5. Followed up with internal teams regarding the status of the ticket and the Salesforce functionality.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a problem with the "On Hold" tab in the customer Salesforce UI, which was not displaying the tickets correctly due to the transition to a new ticketing platform.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming with the internal team that the customer portal was functioning correctly after the necessary adjustments were made. The customer was informed that the ticket status was "on hold" due to the pending release of a new image to address the vulnerabilities.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly with customers during transitions to new platforms to manage expectations.
- Ensure that all links and functionalities are tested before transitioning to a new ticketing system to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Keep customers updated on the status of their tickets, especially when they are marked as "on hold."
