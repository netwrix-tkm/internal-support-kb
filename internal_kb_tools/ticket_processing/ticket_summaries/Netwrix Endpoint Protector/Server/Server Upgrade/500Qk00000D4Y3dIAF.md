## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D4Y3dIAF
- **Case Number:** 414938
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Doxim Striata LLC
- **Contact Name:** Danie de Jager
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to upgrade their Endpoint Protector (EPP) application, receiving an error message indicating that a hash does not match. Additionally, the customer was unable to log tickets via email and had to create an account on the Netwrix portal to submit the issue.

## Environment Details
- The EPP appliance is hosted in AWS.
- The customer needed to access the backend of the EPP appliance via SSH.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the migration of the ticketing system to the Netwrix portal.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the upgrade issue.
3. Accessed the backend of the EPP appliance via SSH after ensuring the customer's local IP was added to the allow-list.
4. Investigated the nginx configuration, which was set to allow access only on port 8443.
5. Noted that the server UI was accessible on port 443, which was unexpected given the configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an erroneous patch that had been applied to the EPP server, which resulted in a hash mismatch during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The resolution involved deleting the erroneous patch and its associated entries from the EPP server backend. After this cleanup, the customer was able to successfully apply the hotfix 1.1.

## Notes
- Ensure that any patches applied to the EPP server are verified to prevent similar hash mismatch errors in the future.
- When troubleshooting access issues, confirm that the correct ports are open and that the necessary IP addresses are allowed in the firewall settings.
