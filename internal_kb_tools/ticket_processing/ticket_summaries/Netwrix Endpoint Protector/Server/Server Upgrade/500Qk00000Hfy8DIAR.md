- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motorola Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Harris
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0 (upgraded to 5.9.4.0)

## Problem Description
The customer, Motorola Solutions, requested guidance on acquiring new server hardware for their online network and the process for deploying new on-premises boxes in their environment.

## Environment Details
- The customer is running VMware ESXi.
- The existing Endpoint Protector (EPP) server version is 5.9.3.0.
- The request involves migrating from old servers to new servers, not adding additional servers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to discuss the hardware request.
2. Provided the latest EPP server image (version 5.9.4.0) and MD5 checksum for verification.
3. Advised the customer to:
   - Create a snapshot of the old EPP server.
   - Install the new EPP server image on a VM and assign it a new IP.
   - Upgrade the old EPP server to version 5.9.4.0 if it was not already upgraded.
   - Create a System Backup v2 from the old EPP server and save the key for later use.
   - Download the System Backup v2.
   - Import the System Backup v2 into the new EPP server.
   - If the upload failed due to file size, SSH into the backend of the new EPP server to adjust the upload limit.
   - Verify that both servers matched in terms of computers, policies, settings, and licenses.
   - Allocate the IP of the old EPP server to the new EPP server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to upgrade the existing EPP server and migrate data to a new server setup, which required specific steps to ensure compatibility and successful data transfer.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Changing the System Backup v2 upload limit from 200MB to 500MB for the new EPP server, allowing the backup file to be uploaded successfully.
- Migrating the data from the old EPP server to the new one after ensuring both were on the same version (5.9.4.0).

## Notes
- Always ensure that both the old and new EPP servers are running the same version before migration.
- For air-gapped networks, the upload limit was noted to be 160MB; adjustments may be necessary based on specific network configurations.
- It is advisable to keep the ticket open for a period after resolution in case the customer encounters any further issues.
