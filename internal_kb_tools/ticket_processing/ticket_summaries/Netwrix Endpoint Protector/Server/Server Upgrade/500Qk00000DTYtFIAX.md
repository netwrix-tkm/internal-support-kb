## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with applying a pending security update (HWA-EPP4-U8800) for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Despite multiple attempts (approximately six), the update continued to reappear without successful installation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted installation of the security update HWA-EPP4-U8800 multiple times (approximately six).
2. Verified the system requirements and compatibility for the update.
3. Checked for any existing errors or logs related to the update installation process.
4. Ensured that the server was not experiencing any connectivity issues that could affect the update process.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was likely related to a failure in the update installation process that prevented the system from recognizing the update as successfully applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix (adv-2024-002) that addressed the underlying problems preventing the installation of the security update HWA-EPP4-U8800. This hotfix allowed the update to be successfully applied.

## Notes
- Ensure that all prerequisites for applying security updates are met before installation.
- Monitor the update installation process closely for any error messages or logs that may indicate issues.
- For future cases, consider deploying hotfixes as a potential solution if standard update procedures fail.
