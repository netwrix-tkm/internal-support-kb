- **Account/Company:** Walt Disney Pictures
- **Contact Name:** Guill Espinosa
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with migrating their server to Ubuntu 22.04 or higher and upgrading the Endpoint Protector (EPP) version to 5.8 or higher. The initial server upgrade attempt failed, prompting the creation of a new appliance from scratch.

## Environment Details
- **Current Server Version:** 5600
- **Target Server Version:** 5940
- **Endpoints:** Approximately 20
- **Hosting:** Hosted locally with different IP/hostname DNS
- **Logs:** No logs available

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Discussed migration and upgrade plans with the customer.
2. Attempted to upgrade the existing server, which failed.
3. Created a new appliance from scratch.
4. Conducted initial setup of the new appliance.
5. Requested SSH access for the customer to test the new setup.
6. Opened a Lexion request for SSH access.
7. Provided the customer with legal documentation for SSH access.
8. Followed up with the customer regarding testing and access needs.

## Root Cause
The initial server upgrade failed due to compatibility issues or configuration errors, necessitating the creation of a new appliance.

## Solution
The server was successfully migrated to the new appliance running Ubuntu 22.04 and EPP version 5.9.4.0. The customer was informed of the successful migration and was asked to confirm functionality.

## Notes
- The customer declined SSH access, indicating it was not needed.
- Ensure that all necessary ports are open for future installations:
  - Port 443 for the web UI
  - Port 80 for Live Update
  - Port 22 for SSH (only when needed)
- Security updates can be applied from the Live Update section, which is available in versions after 5.9.0.0.
