## Problem Description
The customer reported uncertainty regarding whether there were backend updates or if the listed library modules had been recently backed up. The inquiry was specifically about the layout and information presented in the system.

## Environment Details
- The system is built on Ubuntu, which is relevant for understanding the backend updates.
- The customer has sufficient space to apply backend security updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the layout to determine if backend updates were indicated.
2. Checked the list of library modules to ascertain their status.
3. Confirmed that there was sufficient disk space available for applying updates.
4. Clarified that the Security Backend Updates are related to the operating system (Ubuntu) on which the EPP server is built.
5. Explained that functionality and EPP application upgrades can be performed using the "Check Now" functionality.

## Root Cause
The confusion stemmed from the layout presentation of backend updates and the library modules, which did not clearly indicate the status of updates or backups.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that:
- The Security Backend Updates pertain to the underlying OS (Ubuntu).
- Functionality and EPP application upgrades can be accessed from the same section using the "Check Now" functionality.
- The customer was reassured that there was sufficient space to apply the necessary backend security updates.

## Notes
- Future communications should emphasize the distinction between backend updates and library module backups to avoid similar confusion.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the "Check Now" functionality for managing updates and upgrades effectively.
