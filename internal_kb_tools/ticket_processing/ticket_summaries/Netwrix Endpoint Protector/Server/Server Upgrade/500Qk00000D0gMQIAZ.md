- **Contact Name:** Kevin Pindjak
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with upgrading their server from version 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0, indicating that they believed the client software needed to be upgraded first.

## Environment Details
- Current server version: 5.7.1.0
- Target server version: 5.9.3.0
- Client software upgrade required prior to server upgrade.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to discuss the upgrade process.
2. Provided detailed instructions for the incremental upgrade process:
   - Upgrade the server to version 5.8.0.0.
   - Upgrade the server to version 5.9.0.0.
   - Upgrade the server to version 5.9.1.0.
3. Instructed the customer to upgrade the client software after the server reached version 5.9.1.0.
4. Advised on the final steps to upgrade the server to version 5.9.2.0 and then to 5.9.3.0.
5. Confirmed the completion of the upgrade process and scheduled a follow-up call to ensure everything was functioning correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need for an incremental upgrade process due to the significant version gap between the current server version (5.7.1.0) and the target version (5.9.3.0). The customer was unaware that the client software needed to be upgraded first before proceeding with the server upgrade.

## Solution
The server was successfully upgraded to the latest version (5.9.3.0) following the outlined incremental upgrade steps. The client software was also upgraded as part of the process, ensuring compatibility with the new server version.

## Notes
- It is crucial to follow the incremental upgrade path when upgrading from older versions to avoid potential issues.
- Always ensure that client software is upgraded before upgrading the server to maintain compatibility.
- Schedule follow-up sessions to confirm that all components are functioning correctly after major upgrades.
