## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that the update process for their new test EPP server was stuck at 37.5% while attempting to upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. The update process did not complete after waiting for almost a day.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred during the setup of a new test EPP server after transferring settings from the main EPP server, including CAP policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer's network team was contacted to check network access.
2. Verified if the update process could be resumed or if an offline patch could be applied.
3. Confirmed that the update was stuck and not progressing.

## Root Cause
The update process was blocked due to a lack of network access to the live update server (liveupdate.endpointprotector.com) at IP address 178.63.3.86:443.

## Solution
The customer's network team opened access to the required IP address. Once access was granted, the customer was able to successfully apply the live update patch, upgrading the server to version 5.9.4.0.

## Notes
- Ensure that network access to the live update server is available before initiating updates to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to monitor the update process and check network configurations if updates are stalled.
