## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cz1GPIAZ
- **Case Number:** 414836
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bob Card
- **Contact Name:** BOB CARD
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Problem Description
The customer scheduled an upgrade activity for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server on July 15, 2024, at 9:00 PM IST. They requested standby support in case any issues arose during the upgrade process.

## Environment Details
- **Current Server Version:** 5.9.1.0
- **Build Number:** 5930
- **Hotfix Deployed:** adv-2024-002

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the current server version with the customer.
2. Advised the customer to apply two patches from the console (Dashboard > Live Update > Check Now).
3. Monitored the upgrade process and provided support as needed.
4. Addressed issues when the second update became stuck and CLI access was lost.
5. Informed the customer to disregard the hotfix 1.1 upgrade as it would not affect future updates.

## Root Cause
The second update during the upgrade process became stuck, which prevented CLI access to the server. This issue was identified as a temporary glitch that could occur during the update process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the hotfix adv-2024-002 successfully, which allowed the upgrade to complete. The customer was advised that the lingering update notification would be resolved with the next server version release (5.9.4.0).

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the potential for updates to become stuck during the upgrade process.
- Advise customers to keep track of the server version and apply all necessary patches before scheduled upgrades.
- Future updates may resolve lingering notifications from previous upgrades, so customers should be informed about upcoming releases.
