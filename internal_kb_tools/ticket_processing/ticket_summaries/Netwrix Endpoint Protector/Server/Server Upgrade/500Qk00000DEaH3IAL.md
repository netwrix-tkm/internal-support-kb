## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DEaH3IAL
- **Case Number:** 415366
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NautaDutilh
- **Contact Name:** Koen Korteweg
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with updating their appliance. After navigating to Dashboard > Live Update and applying the available update, the notification indicating that an update is available did not disappear, leading to uncertainty about whether the update was successfully applied.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server
- **Age of the appliance:** 5.8

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was advised to check the "View Applied Updates" list from the Live Update section to confirm if the update was installed.
2. It was clarified that the update option would remain available because it pertains to version 5.9.3.0, which is a newer version than what the customer had.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a misunderstanding regarding the update notification. The update notification remained visible because it was for a newer version (5.9.3.0) that was not yet installed, despite the fact that the current update had been successfully applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix (adv-2024-002) that addressed the update notification behavior. The customer was informed that they could ignore the update notification if they had already installed the update.

## Notes
- Customers should be informed that update notifications may persist for newer versions even after successfully applying the current update.
- It is recommended to regularly check the "View Applied Updates" list to confirm successful installations.
