- **Account/Company:** eNoah iSolution India Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Manojkumar Mohan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to upgrade their server operating system from Ubuntu 18.04 to the latest version and to migrate existing data captured by the system.

## Environment Details
- Current OS: Ubuntu 18.04
- Target OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Existing EPP Server Version: 5.9.2.0
- New EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Request:** Customer requested AMI details from their sales representative.
2. **Session Scheduling:** Multiple remote sessions were scheduled to assist with the migration process.
3. **Backup Creation:** A System Backup V2 was created from the existing EPP console.
4. **VM Creation:** Attempted to create a new EPP VM in the AWS environment.
5. **Error Encountered:** Encountered "Instance reachability check failed" error during VM setup.
6. **Image Verification:** AWS support team investigated the image upload issue, suspecting file corruption.
7. **Alternative Image Request:** Requested an alternative image file in .vhd or .vhdx format.
8. **Successful Upgrade:** Upgraded the DLP server version to 5.9.4.0 during a session.
9. **Final Migration Steps:** Successfully imported the System Backup V2 into the new EPP VM and upgraded to version 5.9.4.1.

## Root Cause
The initial image file used for the VM creation was suspected to be corrupted, leading to the "validation check failed" status during the AWS instance setup.

## Solution
- Provided a new image file in .vhdx format along with a setup guide.
- Successfully created a new EPP VM in the AWS environment.
- Imported the System Backup V2 and confirmed the successful upgrade to version 5.9.4.1.

## Notes
- Ensure to take a snapshot of the existing VM before performing upgrades or migrations to allow for quick recovery if issues arise.
- Always verify the integrity of the image files before deployment to avoid complications during the setup process.
- The System Backup V2 does not include logs, audits, or system backups; ensure these are handled separately if needed.
