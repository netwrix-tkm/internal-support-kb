- **Case Number:** 413239
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS Associates India Pvt. Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Manpreet Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported a need to upgrade their CoSoSys Endpoint Protect to address security vulnerabilities related to remote code execution as outlined in Security Advisory ADV-2024-002.

## Environment Details
- Current version: 5.9.3.0
- Target version: 5.9.3.0 Hotfix #1
- Approximately 13,200 machines running version 5.9.3.5, with 800 machines on version 6.2.2.1.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to confirm the need for the hotfix.
2. Scheduled a remote session to apply the hotfix.
3. The hotfix was temporarily paused due to issues reported by other customers after initial patching.
4. A revised hotfix (Hotfix 1.1) was released to address the event processing issues.
5. Confirmed with the customer that they were ready for the hotfix to be applied.
6. Conducted a remote session to apply the hotfix and validate functionality.

## Root Cause
The delay in applying the hotfix was due to the discovery of issues with the initial patch that caused some systems to stop processing logged events. This led to a temporary pause in the distribution of the hotfix until a revised version could be released.

## Solution
The revised hotfix (Hotfix 1.1) was successfully applied during a scheduled remote session. The following steps were taken:
1. A snapshot of the server was created for safety.
2. The offline patch was applied during the session.
3. The entire user interface was checked to ensure all functionalities were operational post-application.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the system closely after applying the hotfix to ensure no further issues arise.
- Customers should be informed about the importance of updating their agents to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075.
- Future upgrades should include a follow-up session with support to validate functionality, especially if previous upgrades have caused issues.
