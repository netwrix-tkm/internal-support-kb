## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying Hotfix 1.1 twice, it continued to appear in the list of available updates, leading to confusion about whether the hotfix was successfully applied or if there was an underlying issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in the context of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The specific server version mentioned was Eppserver 5.9.3.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer applied Hotfix 1.1 two times.
2. Customer inquired whether the hotfix was successfully applied or if there was a problem.
3. Technical support confirmed the application of the hotfix and provided guidance on how to verify it.

## Root Cause
The hotfix was successfully applied, but it remained visible in the update list because it was still available for the Eppserver version 5.9.3.0. This was a normal behavior until a newer version (5.9.4.0) was released.

## Solution
The technical support engineer confirmed that:
- The hotfix was indeed applied successfully.
- The customer could verify the application of the hotfix by checking the "applied updates" section in the Live-Update interface.
- The visibility of the hotfix would be resolved once the update for version 5.9.4.0 was released and applied.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that certain updates may remain visible even after application, particularly when newer versions are pending release.
- It is advisable to check the "applied updates" section for confirmation of successful hotfix applications to avoid confusion.
