- **Case Number:** 424920
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
PrivatBank reported vulnerabilities in their Test EPP server running on Ubuntu 22. They were unable to apply security updates due to a restriction on opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic, as per their security policy.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22
- **Security Policy:** Prohibits opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to apply security updates via Live update.
2. Conducted a remote session to troubleshoot backend connectivity issues.
3. Confirmed that the server could not access the Ubuntu archive over port 80.

## Root Cause
The inability to apply security updates was due to PrivatBank's security policy, which prohibited unencrypted traffic over port 80, preventing the server from accessing the necessary update repositories.

## Solution
The customer managed to upgrade the security updates offline, circumventing the need for port 80 access. Specific steps taken for the offline update were not detailed in the case.

## Notes
- Future cases involving security updates in environments with strict security policies should consider offline update methods.
- Ensure to clarify the customer's security policies early in the troubleshooting process to avoid delays.
