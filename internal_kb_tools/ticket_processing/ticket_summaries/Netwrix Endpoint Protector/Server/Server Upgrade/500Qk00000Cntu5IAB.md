- **Case Number:** 414362
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Transcend Street Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Chandrasekhar Ongole
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer was running EPP version 5.6.0.0 and wanted to upgrade to the latest version (5.9.3.0). They encountered an issue requiring an offline patch for version 5.6.5.0 to enable database partitioning before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted in the customer's AWS account.
- The server was initially set up without a known SSH password.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reviewed upgrade documentation and identified the need for an offline patch.
2. Support recommended creating a snapshot of the AWS instance before proceeding with the upgrade.
3. A remote session was proposed to assist with the upgrade and SSH access was discussed.
4. The offline patch (EPP500575650.tar.gz) was provided to the customer.
5. The customer applied the patch via the Web console and proceeded with sequential updates to reach version 5.9.3.0.
6. The customer reported that the disk space remained at 100GB despite setting it to 300GB during the EC2 instance creation.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the need for an offline patch to enable database partitioning, which was required for the upgrade process. Additionally, the disk space issue was due to the operating system partitions not being expanded after increasing the AWS EBS volume size.

## Solution
- The customer successfully applied the offline patch and updated the server to version 5.9.3.0.
- The customer was advised to access the server via SSH to resize the partitions manually, as the support team could not provide SSH credentials due to legal processes.
- A remote session was scheduled to assist with any further issues and to help resize the partitions if necessary.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that SSH access is properly configured and that the password is documented during the initial setup of the server.
- Always create a snapshot of the instance before performing upgrades to safeguard against potential issues.
- If disk space is increased in AWS, ensure that the underlying operating system partitions are also resized to utilize the additional space.
