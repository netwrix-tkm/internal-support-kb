- **Case Number:** 433006
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hughes Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Zach Metz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to upgrade their server from version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1. Despite multiple attempts to apply the update immediately and schedule it, the server remained on version 5.9.4.0. The upgrade was necessary due to the ADV-2025-001 advisory.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 5.9.4.0
- **Target Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Advisory Reference:** ADV-2025-001

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to apply the update immediately.
2. Attempted to schedule the update.
3. Checked the patch application status.
4. Re-added the patch to the live server and verified the correct path.

## Root Cause
The patch did not apply initially because it was checked before re-adding it to the live server, which resulted in the system not finding the correct path for the update.

## Solution
After re-checking the patch application and ensuring the correct path was set, the patch was successfully applied. The customer confirmed that the upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 was successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that the patch is correctly re-added to the live server before checking its application status to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the correct path for patch updates to ensure successful application.
