- **Component:** Server

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the security update (EPP Server Hotfix #1.1) was not installing on their server, remaining stuck at the "Downloading patch" stage.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry for more details about the issue and any error messages encountered.
2. Requested a screenshot of the error message.
3. Suggested verifying if port 80 was open and if the URL `https://liveupdate.endpointprotector.com/` was allowed in the firewall.
4. Asked the customer to check under the menu "View Applied Updates" to see if the patch was present.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a firewall configuration problem that was blocking the necessary connection to the update server, preventing the patch from downloading successfully.

## Solution
The customer was advised to adjust their firewall settings to allow traffic through port 80 and to ensure that the update server URL was whitelisted. After making these changes, the patch was successfully downloaded and installed.

## Notes
- Ensure that firewall settings are reviewed before attempting to download updates in the future.
- It is advisable to check for any network restrictions that may affect the update process.
