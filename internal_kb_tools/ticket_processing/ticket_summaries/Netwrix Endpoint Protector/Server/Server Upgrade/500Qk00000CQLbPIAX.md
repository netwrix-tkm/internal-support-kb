## Problem Description
After installing Hotfix#1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800) for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, the system repeatedly prompts the user to install the same hotfix, indicating that it has not been recognized as installed, despite successful installations.

## Environment Details
- The issue was tested on a test system where the hotfix was installed twice without resolution.
- The customer reported that the hotfix was installed once on their production system.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to install the hotfix twice on their test system.
2. Screenshots were provided to demonstrate the repeated prompts for installation.
3. Netwrix support acknowledged the issue and confirmed they were investigating it.
4. A suggestion was made for a remote connection to remove the erroneous installation entry if desired.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a system recognition issue where the hotfix installation was not properly registered, leading to repeated prompts for installation. It was confirmed that applying the hotfix multiple times does not change the system's state.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the hotfix had been successfully applied after the first installation. Netwrix support indicated that further installations would not be necessary and offered to assist with removing any erroneous entries if the customer desired a clean state.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the hotfix installation process is monitored to confirm successful application.
- Customers should be informed that repeated installations of the same hotfix do not alter the system state and may lead to confusion.
- If similar issues arise, consider offering remote support to address any lingering installation prompts or entries.
