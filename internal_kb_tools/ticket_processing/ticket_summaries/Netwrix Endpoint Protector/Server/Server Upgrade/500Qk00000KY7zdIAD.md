- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with updating both the back-end and front-end of their Netwrix Endpoint Protector to version 5.9.4.1. This was a recurring problem, as previous attempts required manual intervention from support. The customer sought assistance to resolve the issue and enable autonomous updates in the future.

## Environment Details
- The updates were attempted on a server running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific version targeted for the update was 5.9.4.1.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to update to version 5.9.4.1 but encountered issues.
2. Support identified that the update might not have been available due to the drip release phase.
3. The customer was advised to wait for the update to be available in General Availability (GA).
4. A meeting was scheduled to address the security updates that did not apply after the upgrade.
5. During troubleshooting, it was noted that SSH access was not available during the initial call.
6. The dpkg was cleared, which allowed the updates to proceed successfully.

## Root Cause
The initial failure to update was likely due to the version not being available during the drip release phase. Additionally, issues with the dpkg cache may have contributed to the update failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the dpkg cache, which allowed the updates to work successfully. The server was upgraded to version 5.9.4.1 without further issues, and the necessary security updates were applied afterward.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSH access is available during troubleshooting sessions to facilitate remote support.
- Monitor the availability of updates during the drip release phase to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Clearing the dpkg cache can be a useful step when encountering update issues on the server.
