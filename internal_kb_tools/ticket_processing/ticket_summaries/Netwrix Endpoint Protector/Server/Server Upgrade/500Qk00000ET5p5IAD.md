## Problem Description
The customer reported that backend updates for the appliance were failing during the installation of Security and other updates, resulting in a kernel panic. Security updates alone were functioning correctly.

## Environment Details
- The system was reset to a functional state prior to the issue.
- The specific error encountered was a kernel panic during the update process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the update process for backend installations.
2. Attempted to apply the updates again after resetting the system.
3. Monitored the system for any error messages or logs during the update process.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the kernel panic during the installation of Security and other updates was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was determined that the issue was isolated to the specific combination of updates being applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following the backend update process correctly. The updates were applied successfully, and the server was restarted without further issues.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the system is in a stable state before attempting updates.
- Future updates should be monitored closely for any signs of kernel panic or other critical errors.
- If kernel panic occurs again, consider isolating the updates to identify which specific update may be causing the issue.
