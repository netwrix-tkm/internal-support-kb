## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kv6GWIAZ
- **Case Number:** 433108
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Navy Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Sean Briza
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested an offline patch for version 5.9.4.1 because the live update feature was not downloading the necessary updates.

## Environment Details
- The issue was suspected to be related to network configurations, specifically the blocking of Port 80, which is required for live updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's need for an offline patch to upgrade to version 5.9.4.1.
2. Suggested the customer check internally if Port 80 was blocked, which could prevent the live update from functioning.
3. Inquired if the customer could temporarily allow internet access to their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server to facilitate the upgrade via live update.
4. Awaited the release of the offline patch for version 5.9.4.1.

## Root Cause
The live update feature was not functioning due to the potential blocking of Port 80 on the customer's network, which is necessary for the update process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the production server using the offline patch once it was made available. The customer confirmed that the upgrade was successful, allowing the case to be closed.

## Notes
- It is important to verify network configurations, particularly firewall settings, when troubleshooting live update issues.
- Future customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to check if necessary ports are open and consider allowing temporary internet access for updates if feasible.
