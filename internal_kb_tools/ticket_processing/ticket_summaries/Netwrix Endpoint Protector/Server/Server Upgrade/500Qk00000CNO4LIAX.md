- **Case Number:** 413246
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Viskase Companies
- **Contact Name:** Martin Polaszewski
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that no patches were available when checking Live Update for the affected version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. This was related to a CVE advisory (ADV-2024-002).

## Environment Details
- The customer was running version 5.9.3.0 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the current version of the Endpoint Protector server.
2. Checked for available patches through Live Update.
3. Communicated with the customer regarding the availability of the hotfix.
4. Scheduled a remote session to apply the hotfix.
5. Applied the hotfix (adv-2024-002) during the remote session.
6. Verified that logs were being received after the hotfix was applied.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a vulnerability that required a hotfix to be applied. The logs had not been sent since June 28, leading to a backlog that affected system performance.

## Solution
The hotfix (adv-2024-002) was successfully deployed during a remote session with the customer. After applying the hotfix, the logs began to flow correctly, and the system performance was restored.

## Notes
- It is recommended to create a snapshot of the EPP server before applying any upgrades or hotfixes.
- If high CPU usage persists after applying the hotfix, it may be due to a large volume of logs being sent from the EPP clients. Monitor the situation and consider scheduling another remote session if issues continue.
