- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stephani Hungaria Gepgyarto Kft.
- **Contact Name:** Rendszergazda Rendszergazda
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with installing EPP Server Hotfix #1.1. Although the update appeared to install successfully, it reappeared in the available updates list after checking for updates, indicating that the installation did not complete properly. Additionally, two older product updates from 2022 were grayed out, and attempts to cancel them resulted in an error stating that the updates could not be canceled because they had begun running.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation process for EPP Server Hotfix #1.1.
2. Attempted to install the hotfix multiple times (approximately six attempts).
3. Checked for updates after each installation attempt to confirm if the hotfix was still listed as available.
4. Investigated the status of the two older 2022 product updates that were grayed out.
5. Attempted to cancel the grayed-out updates, which resulted in an error message.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a problem with the update installation process that prevented the hotfix from being fully applied, despite the system indicating a successful installation. The older updates being grayed out and unable to be canceled suggested that they were in a state that prevented further actions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the vulnerabilities associated with the updates were fixed. This likely involved either a patch or an update from Netwrix that addressed the underlying problems with the update installation process. After the fix was applied, the customer was able to successfully install the hotfix and the older updates.

## Notes
- Ensure that all updates are fully applied and that the system is checked for any lingering issues after installation.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking for any known vulnerabilities or patches that may affect the update process.
- Document any error messages encountered during the update process for future reference and troubleshooting.
