## Problem Description
The customer, Hefeng from Huawei, submitted a request for an offline patch to address security vulnerabilities (ADV-2024-002) in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify, as their environment is unable to connect to the Internet.

## Environment Details
- The environment is isolated and does not have Internet access, necessitating the need for an offline patch.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial response provided a link to the offline patch: `https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gzb`.
2. Customer reported that the provided link returned a "NOT FOUND" error.
3. Support engineer verified the link and provided a corrected link: `https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz`.
4. Advised the customer to create a VM snapshot before applying the patch.

## Root Cause
The initial link provided for the offline patch was incorrect (contained an extra 'b' at the end), leading to a 404 error when accessed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by supplying the correct link to the offline patch, allowing the customer to download and apply the necessary security updates.

## Notes
- Always verify the accuracy of URLs provided in support communications to prevent access issues.
- Remind customers to create VM snapshots before applying patches to ensure they can revert to a previous state if necessary.
