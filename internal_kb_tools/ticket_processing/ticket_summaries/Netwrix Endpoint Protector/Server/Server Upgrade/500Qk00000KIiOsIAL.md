## Problem Description
The customer reported that the update to version 5.9.4.1 of Netwrix Endpoint Protector failed with an error message indicating that issues occurred during installation, specifically stating: "WÃ¤hrend der Installation sind einige Probleme aufgetreten. Bitte Support benachrichtigen. (FEHLER: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update...)"

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message provided during the update attempt.
2. Attempted to re-initiate the update process to see if the error persisted.
3. Cleared any temporary files or caches that might interfere with the installation.
4. Checked server logs for additional error details related to the update failure.
5. Confirmed that the server met all prerequisites for the update.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the update process due to exceeding the maximum number of retries allowed for the installation. This could have been caused by underlying server issues or conflicts with existing configurations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the error from the server backend, which allowed the update process to proceed without further interruptions. After clearing the error, the update to version 5.9.4.1 was successfully completed.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the server's performance and logs during future updates to catch any potential issues early.
- Ensure that all prerequisites for updates are met before initiating the installation to minimize the risk of similar errors.
- If the error persists in future updates, consider increasing the maximum retry limit or investigating server health and configuration settings.
