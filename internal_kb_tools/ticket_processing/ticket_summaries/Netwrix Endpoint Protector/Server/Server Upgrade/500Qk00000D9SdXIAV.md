## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D9SdXIAV
- **Case Number:** 415171
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Los Angeles Police Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Stephen Tan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with applying the Endpoint Protector (EPP) Server Hotfix #1.1 through the Live Update feature. Although the update appeared to install successfully, it continued to show as available for installation upon checking for updates again.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Hotfix:** EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to install the hotfix multiple times, each time receiving confirmation that the installation was successful.
2. The customer checked for updates again after installation, only to find the hotfix still listed as available.
3. Support advised the customer to verify if the hotfix was applied by checking the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section in the Dashboard under Live Update.

## Root Cause
The hotfix was successfully applied to the system, but it remained listed as available for installation in the Live Update interface. This behavior is expected and does not indicate a failure in the installation process.

## Solution
Support confirmed that the hotfix was indeed applied successfully. They informed the customer that the hotfix would not disappear from the available updates list until the EPP Server was updated to version 5940. This clarification resolved the customer's concerns regarding the update status.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that certain updates may remain visible in the available updates list even after successful installation.
- Customers should be advised to check the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section to confirm the successful application of updates.
- Future updates to the EPP Server (specifically to version 5940) will remove the hotfix from the available updates list.
