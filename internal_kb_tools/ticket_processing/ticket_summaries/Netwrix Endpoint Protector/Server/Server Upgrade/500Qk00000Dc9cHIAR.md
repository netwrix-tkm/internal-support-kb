## Problem Description
The customer requested support for upgrading their Netwrix Endpoint Protector from version 5.4.0.0 to the latest available version. Due to security protocols, all workstations were without internet access, prompting the inquiry about using the offline patch uploader for the upgrade.

## Environment Details
- The environment consisted of multiple workstations (WMS) that were isolated from the internet for security reasons.

2. Discussed the offline patch uploader option with the customer.
3. Provided guidance on how to use the offline patch uploader for the upgrade process.
4. Executed the upgrade process on the server using the offline patch uploader.

## Root Cause
The need for an upgrade was driven by security concerns, and the lack of internet access on the workstations necessitated the use of an offline upgrade method.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully upgrading the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server to the latest version using the offline patch uploader. The upgrade process was completed without any reported issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the offline patch uploader is available and properly configured for future upgrades in environments with restricted internet access.
- Always verify the compatibility of the new version with existing systems before proceeding with the upgrade.
