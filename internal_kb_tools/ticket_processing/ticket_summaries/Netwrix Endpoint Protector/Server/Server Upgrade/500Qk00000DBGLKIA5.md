## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying EPP Server Hotfix 1.1 to their on-premises server, the update was still listed among pending updates, and the server and client versions did not change. The customer sought clarification on whether this was a glitch or if they needed to reapply the hotfix.

- **Hotfix Applied:** EPP Server Hotfix 1.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the application of Hotfix 1.1 was visible in the list of applied updates.
2. Advised the customer to disregard the pending status of the hotfix, as it was a known issue.
3. Provided instructions for uploading the client patch via Live Update.
4. Suggested checking the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section for confirmation of the hotfix application.
5. Offered to set up a remote session to assist further if needed.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known glitch where the hotfix remains listed as pending even after successful application. This behavior does not affect the functionality or security of the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming with the customer that the hotfix was applied successfully despite its pending status. The customer was advised to wait for the next server version release, which would address this glitch.

## Notes
- Customers may experience similar issues with hotfixes appearing as pending after application; this is a known behavior and does not require reapplication.
- Future updates or releases may resolve this display issue, so customers should be informed to monitor for new versions.
