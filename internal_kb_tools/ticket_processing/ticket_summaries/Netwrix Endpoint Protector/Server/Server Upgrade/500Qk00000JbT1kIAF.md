## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the VM setup process not prompting for login credentials, which is typically expected during installation. This was compounded by the customer's unfamiliarity with the EPP interface and configuration options.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the initial login credentials and guiding them through the necessary steps to change the root password. Additionally, the customer successfully upgraded to the latest version of EPP (5.9.4.0) and received comprehensive support on configuring E-Discovery policies and other related queries.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that customers are aware of the initial login credentials and the process for changing them during VM setup.
- When dealing with E-Discovery policies, recommend creating multiple policies to accommodate various document formats to reduce false positives.
- Encourage customers to keep their software up to date to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
