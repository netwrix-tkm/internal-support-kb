## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IJ1NpIAL
- **Case Number:** 427042
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dr. Wack Holding GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Siaoyun Chen
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS

## Problem Description
The customer reported significant performance issues with their current server, specifically regarding the slow opening of reports and delays when navigating menu items. An update to the appliance was suggested during a conversation with a representative.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
- **Maximum Records Returned in Report Search:** 200
- **Installed Endpoints:** 204
- **DNS Resolution Issue:** The DNS resolution in the Active Directory (AD) settings was not functioning, preventing LDAP server contact when using the DNS name.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the Ubuntu version and settings related to report search limits and installed endpoints.
2. Identified that the DNS name could not contact the LDAP server, while using the IP address worked.
3. Suggested using the IP address instead of the DNS name as a temporary workaround.
4. Recommended updating the server to a newer virtual appliance to improve performance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the performance issues was not definitively identified; however, it was noted that the DNS resolution in the AD settings was failing, which likely contributed to the slow performance when accessing reports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Migrating to a newer version of the virtual appliance as per the provided update instructions.
2. Following the steps to create a backup of the old server, import it to the new server, and ensure both servers were running the same version.
3. After successful migration, the old VM was shut down, and the IP address of the new VM was changed to match the old one.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always check DNS settings and ensure they are functioning correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular updates to the virtual appliance can help maintain performance and compatibility.
- Always create a snapshot of the VM before performing major updates or migrations to ensure a recovery point is available.
