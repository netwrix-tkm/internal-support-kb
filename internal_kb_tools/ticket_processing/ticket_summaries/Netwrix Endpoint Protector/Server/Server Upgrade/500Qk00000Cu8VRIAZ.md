## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cu8VRIAZ
- **Case Number:** 414675
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Brightidea
- **Contact Name:** Michael Corridon
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying hotfix 1.1, it was still listed as an available update despite receiving a notification that the update was applied successfully. The customer attempted to reapply the hotfix multiple times and rebooted the instance, but the issue persisted.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer applied hotfix 1.1 and received a successful update notification.
2. Customer checked for the hotfix in the update list and found it still available.
3. Customer attempted to reapply the hotfix two additional times.
4. Customer rebooted the instance to see if the update would register.
5. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a failure in the update registration process on the server side, which did not properly reflect the application of the hotfix despite it being successfully deployed.

## Solution
During the remote session, it was confirmed that the EPP Server hotfix was indeed applied successfully. The support engineer provided the customer with links to the EPP clients containing the vulnerability fix for deployment via an MDM tool. The ticket was left open for a week to ensure that the necessary logs were received from the customerâ€™s end.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the application of hotfixes through log files or system notifications to ensure they are correctly registered.
- For future cases, if a hotfix appears to be reapplied without success, consider checking server logs for any errors during the update process.
- Ensure that clients are updated with the latest vulnerability fixes to maintain system security.
