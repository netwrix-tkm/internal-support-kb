## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EgZEIIA3
- **Case Number:** 418602
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sidia Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Upgrade
- **Version:** 5.6.0.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Sidia Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia, reported the need to update their air-gapped server from version 5.6.0.0 to the latest version. However, they faced challenges because partitions were not enabled, and remote access to enable them was difficult due to the server's air-gapped nature.

## Environment Details
- **Server Type:** Air-gapped server
- **Current Version:** 5.6.0.0
- **Network Configuration:** No internet access, making remote sessions impossible.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server's current version and the requirement for an upgrade.
2. Discussed the implications of enabling partitions on an air-gapped server.
3. Explored the possibility of temporarily opening the server to the internet for the update.
4. Applied offline patches (specifically patch 5940) to facilitate the upgrade process.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was the lack of enabled partitions on the air-gapped server, which prevented the standard upgrade process from being executed remotely.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying offline patches to the server. This allowed the upgrade to proceed without needing to enable partitions or establish a remote session. The patches were successfully implemented, and the server was updated to the latest version.

## Notes
- For future reference, when dealing with air-gapped servers, consider the feasibility of applying offline patches as a workaround for updates.
- Ensure that all necessary patches are identified and tested before attempting an upgrade on similar systems.
- Be cautious when considering temporarily opening air-gapped servers to the internet; this should only be done if absolutely necessary and with proper security measures in place.
