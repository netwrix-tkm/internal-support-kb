- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Verbandsgemeinde (VG) Pirmasens (BiRoNet)
- **Contact Name:** Lars Burckhart
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the EPP Server Hotfix where, despite the update being marked as successfully installed, it continued to appear as available for installation. The update was shown multiple times in the "Applied EPP Software Updates" view.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Update in Question:** Security Update â€“ EPP Server Hotfix #1.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to install the update multiple times, but it continued to reappear as available.
2. The customer checked the "Applied EPP Software Updates" view, which showed the update listed nine times.
3. The customer confirmed that the latest backend updates were already installed.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known bug where the update would linger in the system even after being applied. This was not indicative of a failure in the installation process but rather a display issue within the update management system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by acknowledging that the multiple appearances of the update were a known issue. The technical support team advised the customer to ignore the multiple listings and reassured them that this would be addressed in an upcoming patch. The update would eventually disappear from the list once the patch was applied.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be informed that multiple applications of the same update do not result in multiple installations.
- It is important to monitor for future patches that may resolve lingering update issues.
- Communication with the customer should emphasize patience while awaiting the resolution in the next patch release.
