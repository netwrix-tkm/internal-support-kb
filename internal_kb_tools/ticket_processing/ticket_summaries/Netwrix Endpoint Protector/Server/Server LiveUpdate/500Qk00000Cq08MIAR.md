## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cq08MIAR
- **Case Number:** 414495
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hub International Limited
- **Contact Name:** Ebenezer Brew
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Live Update feature for key vulnerabilities was not functioning. Despite scheduling updates and attempting to apply all EPP software updates, the updates did not install, leading to processing errors.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer scheduled a live server update, but it did not install after the scheduled time elapsed.
2. The customer attempted to apply updates manually using the "apply updates/apply all EPP software updates" option, but encountered the same issue.
3. A meeting was scheduled between the support engineer and the customer to investigate the issue further.
4. During the meeting, the server was rebooted, which allowed the patch to be applied successfully.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case notes. However, it was determined that a server reboot was necessary to apply the pending updates, which suggests that the update process may have been stalled due to the server's state.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by rebooting the server, which allowed the pending updates to be applied successfully. After the reboot, the customer confirmed that events were processing normally.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the server is in a proper state to apply updates. If updates are not installing as expected, consider rebooting the server as a potential solution.
- Future cases involving update failures should include checking the server's status and considering a reboot if updates are stuck.
