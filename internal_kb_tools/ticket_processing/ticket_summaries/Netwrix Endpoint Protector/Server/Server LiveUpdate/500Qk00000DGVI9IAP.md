- **Case Number:** 415458
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Senior Helpers
- **Contact Name:** Flakron Salihu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported uncertainty regarding the application of recent security updates for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Despite clicking to apply the update and receiving confirmation that it was complete, the update continued to appear as available for installation, even after multiple attempts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server
- **Age of the Issue:** 3.8 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to apply the security update twice, both times receiving a confirmation message indicating the update was complete.
2. No additional troubleshooting steps were documented or attempted by the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a problem with the update deployment process, which did not properly reflect the successful installation of the hotfix, leading to confusion about the update status.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying Hotfix adv-2024-002, which corrected the update status reporting mechanism within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, ensuring that the updates would no longer appear as available after successful installation.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that customers are aware of the potential for update status discrepancies following security updates.
- Future updates should be monitored closely to confirm that the installation status is accurately reflected in the system.
- Encourage customers to report any similar issues immediately to facilitate timely resolution.
