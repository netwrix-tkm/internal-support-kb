- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with installing a hotfix for their EPP server. Although they had manually installed the hotfix due to a security problem, the system continued to show the hotfix as an available update, and they were unable to install it.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer had already applied a manual hotfix (adv-2024-002) but faced issues with the update queue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the hotfix was applied by checking the "View Applied EPP Software Updates" section in the Dashboard.
2. Advised the customer to disregard the lingering hotfix update in the queue, as it was a known issue.
3. Provided links for the latest client versions for manual installation:
   - MacOS: [EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar)
   - Windows: [EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip](https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip)

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known problem where the hotfix update remained in the queue even after being applied. This was not a bug but rather a feature of the system that was not functioning as intended.

## Solution
The resolution involved confirming that the hotfix had been applied successfully and instructing the customer to disregard the persistent update notification. The support team also indicated that the lingering patch issue would be addressed in a future server release (version 5.9.4.0).

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be informed that the hotfix may still appear in the update queue even after successful installation.
- It is important to keep the customer updated on future releases that may resolve lingering issues.
- Manual installation of client updates may be necessary if automatic updates are not functioning as expected.
