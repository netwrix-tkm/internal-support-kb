## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all necessary ports, such as port 22 for SSH, are allowed on the firewall to facilitate remote support and updates.
- Future cases involving server updates in air-gapped environments should consider the potential impact on data display and functionality, and ensure that all patches are correctly applied.
