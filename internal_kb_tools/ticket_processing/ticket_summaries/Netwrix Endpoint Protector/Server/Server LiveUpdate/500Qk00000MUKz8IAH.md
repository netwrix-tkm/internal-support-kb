- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that after updating their EPP server to version 5.9.4.1, they were unable to receive security updates for their Ubuntu 18.04 server. The system returned "No updates available," despite the last security updates being installed on March 30, 2024.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the customer's server version and the last installed security updates.
2. Investigated the availability of security updates for Ubuntu 18.04.
3. Confirmed that Ubuntu 18.04 reached its end of life (EOL) in May 2023, which would prevent further security updates.
4. Discussed potential upgrade paths with the customer, including migrating to a newer version of Ubuntu.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the end of life (EOL) status of Ubuntu 18.04, which meant that no new security updates were available for that version since May 2023.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that they could upgrade their server by migrating from Ubuntu 18.04 to a new instance running Ubuntu 22.04. Detailed instructions on the migration process were provided to the customer.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the EOL status of operating systems to ensure continued security updates.
- Customers should be advised to plan upgrades to supported versions of their operating systems to avoid similar issues in the future.
