The customer, Javaign Vinson from Chemline, reported issues applying patches for a vulnerability while logged into the security center. The necessary steps for applying the patches were not visible.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Contacted the customer to clarify which specific patch could not be applied and to confirm if they were referring to the EPP console.

3. Attempted to replicate the issue in a controlled environment to understand the visibility problem.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was noted that the patch was successfully applied while troubleshooting another ticket, indicating that the issue may have been transient or related to the specific session of the customer.

## Solution

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the specific patches they need to apply and confirm their access to the correct console.
- Monitor for similar issues where steps may not be displayed in the security center, as this could indicate a broader problem that may need further investigation.
- Document any transient issues thoroughly to assist in future troubleshooting efforts.
