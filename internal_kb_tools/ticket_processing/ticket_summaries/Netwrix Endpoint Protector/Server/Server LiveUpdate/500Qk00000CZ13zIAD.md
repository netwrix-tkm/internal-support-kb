## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CZ13zIAD
- **Case Number:** 413739
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cyberspace Security Solutions Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Hemalatha Gopal
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with updating important security updates for their Endpoint Protector (EPP) Server. Despite multiple attempts to apply the updates, the server was not reflecting the updates as completed.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Specific Update:** EPP Server Hotfix #1 - Important Security Updates for EPP Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to install the security updates multiple times without success.
2. Netwrix support requested additional details, including any error messages and screenshots of the web interface.
3. The customer confirmed that the updates were installed but still appeared pending in the Live Update tab.
4. Support advised the customer to check the "View applied updates" section under the Live Update menu to verify if the hotfix was present.
5. The customer confirmed that the hotfix was indeed listed under applied updates.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a display problem within the EPP Server interface, where the update status did not refresh to reflect the successful installation of the hotfix. The request to update again would persist until the EPP server was updated to version 5.9.4.0.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the hotfix had been successfully applied. The support team informed the customer that the notification to update would disappear after the EPP server was updated to the next version (5.9.4.0). The customer was advised to wait for the release of this version for the interface to reflect the correct update status.

## Notes
- It is important for users to check the "View applied updates" section to confirm successful installations of updates.
- The persistence of update notifications may occur until the server is updated to a newer version, which is a known behavior in the EPP system.
- Customers should be informed that there may not always be an immediate ETA for future version releases.
