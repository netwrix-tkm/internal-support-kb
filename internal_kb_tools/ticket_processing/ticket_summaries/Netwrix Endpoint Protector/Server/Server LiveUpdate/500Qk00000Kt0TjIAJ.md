## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during the installation of the update for Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically receiving the message: "Some problems occurred during installation. Please Contact Support. (ERROR: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update...)".

## Environment Details
- The server was running version 5.9.4.1 of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

3. Scheduled a follow-up meeting with the customer to discuss the issue further.
4. Checked if backend security updates were applied.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was determined that the update process encountered a maximum retry limit, which prevented the installation from completing successfully.

- Future cases should include verification of both the application version and any related backend updates to ensure comprehensive troubleshooting.
