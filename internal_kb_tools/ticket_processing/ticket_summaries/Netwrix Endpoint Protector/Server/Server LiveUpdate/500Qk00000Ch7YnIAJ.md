- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ch7YnIAJ
- **Case Number:** 414148
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMTS Technology GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Novak Vucetic
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the live update feature of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector on their server located in China. They requested an offline patch download link for new security updates, specifically for Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1 and Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1, as they require offline patches for updates.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically noted on a server located in China.
- The customer also mentioned a similar server in Europe that was experiencing the same issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team provided the customer with a download link for Hotfix #1.1:
   - [Download Link](https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz)
2. The customer was instructed to apply the patch and verify that logs were still being received after the update.
3. The customer confirmed successful application of the patch and inquired about the repeated availability of the same update in the available updates list.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need for offline patches for the server in China, which is a known requirement for their environment. The repeated availability of the same update in the available updates list was not indicative of a problem but rather a feature of the update mechanism.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Providing the customer with the correct offline patch (Hotfix #1.1).
- Confirming that the patch could be applied multiple times without adverse effects, as it would only perform the initial update actions again.
- Ensuring that the logs continued to be received post-update, which the customer confirmed.

## Notes
- The customer can ignore the repeated availability of the same update in the updates list, as it does not indicate a need for reapplication.
- It is important to ensure that customers in similar environments are aware of the necessity for offline patches and the implications of repeated updates in their systems.
