- **Case Number:** 414599

- **Account/Company:** STRATO GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Christian Unger
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to test their email server settings. An error message indicated that the IP and Port could not be null in the Proxy settings, preventing the email test from being executed.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was trying to configure SMTP settings for email alerts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to change the Proxy settings to a placeholder value but found that reverting to "none" cleared the field.
2. A remote session was proposed to assist with configuring the SMTP settings.
3. The customer was advised to check their firewall settings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the firewall settings on the customer's mail server, which was blocking the necessary connections for the email alerts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer reconfigured their firewall settings. Once the firewall was properly set up, email alerts began functioning correctly, and the email test could be executed without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that firewall settings are correctly configured to allow necessary traffic for email alerts in future cases.
- Monitor for any timeout issues that may arise during configuration changes, as the customer noted that saving settings previously took 30 seconds, indicating a potential timeout issue.
