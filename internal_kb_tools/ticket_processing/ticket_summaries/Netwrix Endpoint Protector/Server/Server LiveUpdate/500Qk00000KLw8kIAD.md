## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KLw8kIAD
- **Case Number:** 431428
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HQLAx
- **Contact Name:** Daniel HQLAx IT Support
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to update from version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They encountered an "Error 5" related to a checksum error, which was different from the Live Update process. After waiting a few minutes and retrying, the error message changed to indicate that the "Number of maximum retries reached, skipping this update."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to update the software from version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1.
2. Encountered "Error 5" with checksum error.
3. Waited a few minutes and retried the update.
4. Received a new error message indicating maximum retries had been reached.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a backend error related to the checksum verification process during the update. This prevented the update from completing successfully.

## Solution
The error was resolved by removing the backend error, which allowed the update process to proceed without further issues. The customer was able to successfully update to version 5.9.4.1 after this intervention.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor the checksum verification process during updates to prevent similar issues.
- Advise customers to wait a few minutes before retrying updates if they encounter initial errors, as this may allow for backend processes to reset.
- Document any backend errors encountered during updates for future reference and troubleshooting.
