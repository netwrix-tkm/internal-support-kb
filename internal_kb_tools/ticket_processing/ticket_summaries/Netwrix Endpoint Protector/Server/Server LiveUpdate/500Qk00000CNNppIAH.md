## Problem Description
The customer reported that a hotfix related to security advisory ADV-2024-002 was not appearing in the Live Update section of their Netwrix Endpoint Protector system, despite receiving an email notification about its availability.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a system running Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 5.9.3.0.
- The customer was using the Server component of the product.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer checked the Live Update page multiple times but did not see the hotfix listed.
2. A support engineer reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session to apply the hotfix.
3. The customer later confirmed that the hotfix appeared in the Live Update section after some time.

## Root Cause
The initial absence of the hotfix in the Live Update section was likely due to a delay in its availability being reflected for all users. It appears that the hotfix was posted prematurely or not fully propagated across all systems.

## Solution
The issue resolved itself as the hotfix eventually appeared in the Live Update section. The support team confirmed that the hotfix was successfully installed when the customer checked the Applied Updates section.

## Notes
- It is advisable to inform users that there may be a delay in the availability of updates in the Live Update section after an announcement is made.
- The customer suggested that a note be included in future communications to check back later if the update is not immediately visible, which could help reduce unnecessary support tickets.
