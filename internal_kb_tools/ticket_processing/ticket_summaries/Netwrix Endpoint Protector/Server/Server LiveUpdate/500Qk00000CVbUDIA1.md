- **Account/Company:** DEPARTEMENT DU VAL D'OISE
- **Contact Name:** SÃ©bastien LEGEAY
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the automatic upgrade process for "EPP Server Hotfix #1 - Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)." Despite attempting the upgrade twice, the system prompted for the update again after rebooting.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted the automatic upgrade process twice.
2. The customer manually tried to update using an offline patch, which reported a 100% success rate.
3. After rebooting the system, the update prompt reappeared, indicating the hotfix was not successfully applied.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known problem where the hotfix update continues to appear in the list of "Available EPP Software Updates" even after it has been applied. This behavior persisted after server reboots.

## Solution
The resolution involved deploying Hotfix adv-2024-002, which addressed the underlying issue with the update process. After this deployment, the hotfix was successfully applied, and the update prompt no longer appeared.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for similar issues in future updates, as this behavior may recur with other hotfixes.
- Ensure that customers are informed about potential known issues with updates and the steps being taken to resolve them.
- Document any further updates or patches that may be released to address similar problems in the future.
