## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CQEYHIA5
- **Case Number:** 413416
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wasserzweckverband Freiberg
- **Contact Name:** Uwe Passet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during a live update process, specifically receiving the message: "Database partitions are disabled! Please contact Support for assistance!" The error code associated with this issue was HWA-EPP4-U0055.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team scheduled a remote session via Zoom to investigate the issue further.
2. The customer was instructed to install Putty for SSH access to the server.
3. During the remote session, the customer attempted to establish an SSH connection but was unable to do so, despite the SSH server option being activated.
4. The support team suggested checking network configurations and ensuring that port 22 was open.
5. The customer was advised to check if a snapshot of the VM was taken prior to the server upgrade patches.
6. The support team provided offline patches to continue the upgrade without errors.
7. After applying the patches, the customer reported receiving a critical low disk space alert, despite the web frontend indicating available disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the initial error was identified as disabled database partitions, which prevented the live update from proceeding. Additionally, a false positive disk space alert was triggered after the update, indicating critical low disk space when there was actually available space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the necessary updates and patches to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The support team confirmed that the credentials used for SSH access were different and reserved for support team troubleshooting. The customer was instructed to continue applying patches to resolve the disk space alert.

## Notes
- Ensure that the customer has the correct SSH credentials for future troubleshooting.
- Advise customers to monitor disk space and perform regular backups to avoid similar issues.
- It is important to verify network configurations and port accessibility when troubleshooting SSH connection issues.
