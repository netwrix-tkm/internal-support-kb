- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OOpGTIA1
- **Case Number:** 443033
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NSM Magnettechnik
- **Contact Name:** Carsten Briesemann
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that backend security updates could not be installed via the Endpoint Management Console. The last successful updates were installed in December, and while missing updates could be searched, they could not be installed. The customer confirmed that their firewall was not blocking the updates.

## Environment Details
- The updates were being applied to an on-premises installation of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's inability to install backend updates.
2. Requested the customer's availability for a remote session to investigate further.
3. During the investigation, it was discovered that the boot partition was full.
4. Cleared space on the boot partition.
5. Attempted to apply the security patches again, which were successful after clearing the boot partition.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a full boot partition, which prevented the installation of new security updates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing space on the boot partition. Once sufficient space was available, the security patches were successfully applied.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the boot partition space regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that a snapshot of the server is created before performing significant changes or updates, as a precautionary measure.
