- **Case Number:** 414267
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung
- **Contact Name:** Felix Meessen
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 5.9 (September 2023)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a Live Update to Endpoint Protector 5.9 failed during the download step, returning an error message indicating that the update archive checksum did not match the received checksum from the Live Update server.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred during the installation of a patch (HWA-EPP4-U0061) for Endpoint Protector 5.9.
- The error message displayed was in German: "WÃ¤hrend der Installation sind einige Probleme aufgetreten. Bitte Support benachrichtigen. (FEHLER: 6 - Applied update returned: "Update Archive checksum does not match the received checksum from Live Update Server" while being applied.)"

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer contacted the customer to arrange a remote session via Zoom to address the issue.
2. The customer was instructed to have Putty installed for SSH access to the server.
3. A remote session was scheduled for July 12, 2024, to remove the erroneous patch.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a checksum mismatch between the update archive and the checksum received from the Live Update server. This discrepancy prevented the successful application of the update.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix (adv-2024-002) that corrected the checksum mismatch, allowing the update to be applied successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the checksum of updates is verified before deployment to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is recommended to have SSH access tools like Putty ready for remote troubleshooting sessions.
- Always confirm the integrity of the update files received from the Live Update server.
