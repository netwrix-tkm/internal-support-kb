- **Case Number:** 433204
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gemeinde Weyhe
- **Contact Name:** Jens Balk
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to update from Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1. The installation process encountered errors, specifically stating that the maximum number of retries for the update had been reached, and the update was subsequently skipped.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred during the upgrade process of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector software.
- The error message indicated a problem with the installation related to a MySQL database entry.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run the upgrade to version 5.9.4.1.
2. Observed the error message: "ERROR: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update..."
3. Investigated the MySQL database and found that the patch was finishing on a NULL entry.
4. Deleted the problematic NULL entry from the MySQL table.
5. Retried the upgrade process after the deletion.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a NULL entry in the MySQL database that was preventing the patch from completing successfully. This entry caused the installation process to fail and exceed the maximum retry limit.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the NULL entry from the MySQL table. After this action, the upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 was successfully completed without further errors.

## Notes
- Ensure to check the MySQL database for any NULL entries related to patches before attempting an upgrade in the future.
- It may be beneficial to implement a validation step in the upgrade process to catch such issues early on.
- Document any similar occurrences to build a knowledge base for future reference.
