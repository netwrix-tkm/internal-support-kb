## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D1OwsIAF
- **Case Number:** 414918
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AV Squad
- **Contact Name:** Joshua Gomez-Santizo
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with applying the hotfix HWA-EPP4-U8800 to their EPP server. Despite following the update process, the patch did not appear to save, and the update option remained available in the Live Update panel.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Hotfix:** HWA-EPP4-U8800 for RCE vulnerability

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the customer to check the "View Applied Update" list in the Live Update panel to confirm if the update was installed.
2. Clarified that the option to apply the update would remain available for version 5.9.3.0 until the server was updated to version 5.9.4.0.
3. Offered to schedule a remote session for further investigation if needed.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a failure of the update process but rather a misunderstanding regarding the update visibility. The update option remained available because the server was still on version 5.9.3.0, which allowed for the application of the hotfix.

## Solution
The customer was advised to verify the installation of the update in the "View Applied Update" list. Once they confirmed that the update was applied, the issue was considered resolved. The update option would disappear once the server was upgraded to version 5.9.4.0.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware that the update option may remain visible until they upgrade to a newer version of the software.
- It may be beneficial to provide clearer documentation regarding update visibility and confirmation steps to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future.
