## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to apply EPP Server Hotfix #1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800) for important security updates. Although the installation reported success, the update continued to reappear in the update checks, indicating a looping problem.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 5940

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. The support team confirmed that this was a known issue and was actively being worked on.

## Root Cause
The looping issue was identified as a known problem with the Hotfix #1 installation process, which caused the system to incorrectly report the update as not applied even after a successful installation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying Hotfix adv-2024-002, which corrected the looping behavior. The customer confirmed that the hotfix was successfully applied, and the looping issue was no longer present.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for similar looping issues with future hotfixes and ensure that customers are informed of known issues and their resolutions.
- Customers should always verify the application of patches through the specified dashboard to confirm successful installations.
