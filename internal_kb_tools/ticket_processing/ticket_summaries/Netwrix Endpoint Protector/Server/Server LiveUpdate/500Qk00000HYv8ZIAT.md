The customer reported that the Active Directory (AD) Sync was not functioning properly. Although the correct path was provided, the system was not displaying the different Organizational Units (OUs).

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the path provided for the Active Directory Sync.

4. Reviewed logs for any error messages or warnings related to the sync process.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was implied that the configuration settings for the AD Sync may not have been correctly set initially, leading to the failure in displaying the OUs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the correct path was set for the Active Directory Sync. After confirming the path, the sync process was successfully executed, allowing the different OUs to be displayed as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that the path for the Active Directory Sync is correctly configured before initiating the sync process.
- It may be beneficial to review the configuration settings periodically to prevent similar issues in the future.
