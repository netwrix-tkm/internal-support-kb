## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CWryLIAT
- **Case Number:** 413625
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Brokertech
- **Contact Name:** Mike Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 2.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the "EPP Server Hotfix #1 - Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)" update repeatedly appeared as available even after being applied multiple times. The update seemed to execute successfully, but upon checking again, it was still listed as available, raising concerns about potential security vulnerabilities.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to apply the update multiple times, with the update being reported as applied six times.
2. The support engineer, Flaviu Moldovan, reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. The customer reran the update process independently after the initial communication.

## Root Cause
The exact root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was likely related to a temporary glitch in the update application process that prevented the update from being recognized as successfully applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer reran the update process, which successfully applied the update and removed it from the list of available updates. The customer confirmed that the update had finally applied and/or disappeared from the update list.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the possibility of needing to rerun updates if they encounter similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to monitor the update application process for any anomalies in future cases to identify potential underlying issues.
