- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where backend updates were available, but clicking on "Apply Backend Updates" resulted in no action. The customer was unsure if the updates were being installed or if there was another underlying issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was previously encountered, and support had indicated that an update service was not running correctly at that time.
- The server version had not been upgraded since the last occurrence of the problem.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that they had not upgraded the server version since the last successful application of updates.
2. Support inquired if the server version had been updated, suggesting that if it had, a call might be necessary to address the issue.
3. The customer was advised to leave the updates as they were for the time being, unless absolutely necessary.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not definitively identified during this case. However, it was noted that the updates were previously applied successfully, and the lack of action when attempting to apply updates could be related to the update service potentially not running correctly, as indicated in the previous support case.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to leave the updates as they were for now, as they could potentially cause conflicts if applied unnecessarily. The customer agreed to monitor the situation and mark the issue as resolved for the time being.

## Notes
- It is recommended to check the status of the update service if similar issues arise in the future.
- Customers should be advised to avoid applying updates unless they are mandatory to prevent potential conflicts.
- Future support interactions should confirm whether any server version upgrades have occurred since the last successful update application.
