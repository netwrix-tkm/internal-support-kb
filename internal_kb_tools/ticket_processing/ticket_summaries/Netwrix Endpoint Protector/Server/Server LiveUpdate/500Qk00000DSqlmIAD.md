- **Case Number:** 415851
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alyeska Pipeline Service Company
- **Contact Name:** David Monroe
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested SSH access to facilitate troubleshooting, as the Zoom app was not an option in their critical infrastructure environment.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer regarding the SSH access request.
2. Legal documentation was sent to the customer for review and signature via DocuSign.
3. Follow-up emails were sent to the customer to check on the status of the legal review.
4. Once the signed document was received, the technical team prepared to provide an offline patch to create SSH credentials.

## Root Cause
The delay in granting SSH access was due to the requirement for legal documentation to be reviewed and signed before access could be provided.

## Solution
SSH access was successfully granted after the customer signed the necessary legal documents. The offline patch was provided to create the SSH credentials.

## Notes
- Ensure that legal documentation is prepared and sent promptly to avoid delays in similar requests.
- Follow up regularly with the customer to keep them informed of the status of their request.
- Document any changes or updates in the process to streamline future requests for SSH access.
