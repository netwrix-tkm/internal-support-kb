## Problem Description
The customer reported an update failure while attempting to install EPP Server Hotfix #1, receiving an error message indicating that the hash does not match.

## Environment Details
- The EPP Server is hosted on VMware and is deployed on-premises.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided an initial error message: "An error occurred. Hash does not match."
2. The support team requested a more detailed description and a screenshot of the issue, which was not viewable on their end.
3. A remote session was scheduled to access the back-end of the EPP server for further investigation.
4. During the remote session, the support engineer reviewed the installation logs and error messages.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch in the hash during the update process, which typically indicates that the update file may be corrupted or not properly downloaded.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the update file was correctly downloaded and that the installation process was executed without interruptions. The customer was advised to retry the update after confirming the integrity of the update file.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the integrity of update files before installation to prevent hash mismatch errors.
- Customers should be encouraged to report any issues with update downloads immediately to facilitate timely resolution.
- For future reference, if similar hash mismatch errors occur, consider checking network stability and file integrity before proceeding with further troubleshooting.
