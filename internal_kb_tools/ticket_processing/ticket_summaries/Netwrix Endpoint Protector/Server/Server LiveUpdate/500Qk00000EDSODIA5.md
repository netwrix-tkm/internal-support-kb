## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EDSODIA5
- **Case Number:** 417652
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tech Elecon Pvt. Ltd. (Elecon Engineering Group)
- **Contact Name:** Mohit Shastri
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server LiveUpdate
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector 5.9.4.0 update, specifically regarding the application of URL whitelists and the editing of CAP policies that include "Allowed Files" and "Deep Packet Inspection" components. After the update, these components were not being displayed correctly during policy editing, leading to service disruptions for over 1000 users.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the logs to identify issues with the server-side configuration.
2. Attempted to apply URL whitelists multiple times without success.
3. Checked for similar reports in the support system and linked ADO items.
4. Engaged with the product team for insights on the issue.
5. Informed the customer about the need to re-check all desired components when editing CAP policies.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a bug in the EPP Server version 5.9.4.0, which caused the "Allowed Files" and "Deep Packet Inspection" components to not display correctly when editing existing CAP policies. This bug prevented the correct application of these components, leading to significant service disruptions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to re-check all desired components ("Allowed Files" and "Deep Packet Inspection") before saving any edits to the CAP policies. This workaround ensured that the components were included in the edited policies. The product team confirmed that a fix for this bug would be included in the next release of the EPP Server.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware of the need to re-check components when editing CAP policies in version 5.9.4.0 to avoid similar issues.
- A fix for this bug is planned for the next release, so customers should stay updated on new versions.
- It is recommended to monitor the performance of the system closely after updates to identify any potential issues early.
