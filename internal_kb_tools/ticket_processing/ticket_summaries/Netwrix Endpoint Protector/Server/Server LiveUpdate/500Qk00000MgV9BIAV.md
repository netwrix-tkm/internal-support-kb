## Problem Description
The customer, Spencer Chinn from Stanford University, requested assistance in applying the latest EPP software update and backend security updates to their EPP appliance. They specifically needed confirmation of an EPP engineer's availability for a scheduled maintenance window on March 26, 2025, at 8 PM PST.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Appliance:** Used for endpoint protection.
- **Previous Issues:** The customer had previously encountered difficulties applying backend security updates from the EPP console on a test appliance, requiring assistance from Emil Podar.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Spencer reached out to Emil Podar for assistance in scheduling the update.
2. Emil confirmed he would send a meeting invitation for the maintenance window.
3. Spencer communicated the correct time for the maintenance window (8 PM PST) as there was a discrepancy in the initial invite (9 PM PST).
4. Emil attempted to send a new invitation but Spencer reported not receiving it.
5. Spencer created a Zoom meeting for the maintenance window and shared the details with Emil.
6. The remote session was scheduled to apply the security updates.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from communication delays and scheduling conflicts regarding the maintenance window. Additionally, there were previous difficulties in applying updates from the EPP console, which required backend changes by Emil.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully applying the security updates during the scheduled remote session. Emil Podar assisted Spencer in executing the updates from the backend, ensuring the EPP appliance was up to date.

## Notes
- Ensure clear communication regarding meeting times to avoid confusion in future scheduling.
- It may be beneficial to confirm receipt of meeting invitations to prevent delays.
- Document any backend changes made during update processes for future reference.
