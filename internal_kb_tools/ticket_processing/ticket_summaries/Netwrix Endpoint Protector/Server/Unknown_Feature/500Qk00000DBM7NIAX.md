## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DBM7NIAX
- **Case Number:** 415237
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BioCatch
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Itenberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Content Aware Protection (CAP)
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer, BioCatch, reported an issue where the logs for Block & Report / Block & Remediate CAP policies were not displayed in the admin console, despite the policies being correctly applied and functioning. This issue was observed on two macOS Sonoma computers with the 3.0.2.2 agent installed.

## Environment Details
- **Server URL:** https://t08um2j.hosted.endpointprotector.com/
- **Server ID:** LEPPBBGN
- **Agent Version:** 3.0.2.2
- **Operating System:** macOS Sonoma
- **Hotfixes Applied:** Vulnerability hotfixes were applied on the server side.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the Block & Report / Block & Remediate CAP policies were correctly applied and functioning.
2. Collected client logs that captured violations when the policy was set to Report Only and then changed to Block & Report.
3. Investigated the server side for any issues related to log display.
4. Confirmed that the initial hotfix (v1.0) was applied on version 5.9.1.0 before the upgrade to 5.9.3.0.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the need to reapply the updated hotfix (v1.1) after upgrading from version 5.9.1.0 to 5.9.3.0. The initial hotfix did not carry over to the new version, leading to the absence of logs in the admin console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the new hotfix (v1.1) to the server after the upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. After the hotfix was fully applied, the logs for the CAP policies began to display correctly in the admin console.

## Notes
- Ensure that after any upgrade of the Endpoint Protector software, all relevant hotfixes are reapplied to avoid similar issues.
- Monitor the application of hotfixes to confirm they are fully applied before checking for log visibility.
