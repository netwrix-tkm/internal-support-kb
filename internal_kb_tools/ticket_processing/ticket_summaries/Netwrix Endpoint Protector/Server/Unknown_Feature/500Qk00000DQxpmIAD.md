- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Booking.com
- **Contact Name:** Serhat Demir
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Hotfix Application
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The Booking.com team requested assistance for a remote session to apply Hotfix 1.1 on their EPP server (version 5.9.3.0) and to check the custom port configuration. It was noted that Hotfix 1.0 had not been applied prior to this session.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Hotfixes:** Hotfix 1.0 was not applied before attempting to apply Hotfix 1.1.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session for July 24th at 4:00 PM Amsterdam time.
2. Assisted the Booking.com team in applying Hotfix 1.1 to the EPP server.
3. Verified the application of the hotfix and checked the custom port settings post-application.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to apply Hotfix 1.1 on the EPP server, which had not previously received Hotfix 1.0. The absence of the earlier hotfix could potentially lead to compatibility or functionality issues.

## Solution
The server was successfully updated with Hotfix 1.1 during the remote session. Post-update, the custom port settings were checked and confirmed to be correctly configured.

## Notes
- Ensure that all relevant hotfixes are applied in sequence to avoid potential issues with server functionality.
- Future sessions should confirm the current state of hotfixes before proceeding with updates to streamline the process and minimize downtime.
