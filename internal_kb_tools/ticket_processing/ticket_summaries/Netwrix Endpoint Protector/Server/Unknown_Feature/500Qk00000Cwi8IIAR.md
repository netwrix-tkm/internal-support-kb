- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cwi8IIAR
- **Case Number:** 414803
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZS
- **Contact Name:** Mohammad Qamar Sayyed
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** N/A
- **Version:** 5930

## Problem Description
A user reported an error while running a framework from the Terminal for an Xcode application on a Mac. The issue was inconsistent across four users, with varying results when disabling Endpoint Protection (EPP).

## Environment Details
- All users were on the same policy and group.
- All users had the same macOS version.
- Intercept VPN was enabled for all users.
- EPP version was identical across all users.
- No CAP logs were available on the Console, and there were no EPP block notifications on the users' computers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that all users were in the same policy and group.
2. Confirmed that all users had the same macOS version and EPP version.
3. Attempted to disable EPP for the first user, which resolved the issue for them.
4. For the second user, EPP was disabled, but the issue persisted.
5. The third user was able to run the framework without disabling EPP.
6. Reviewed the build command used by the users:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild archive -workspace ${WORKSPACE}.xcworkspace -scheme ${SCHEME} -archivePath "${ARCHIVE_PATH_IOS_SIMULATOR}.xcarchive" -destination "generic/platform=iOS Simulator" -sdk iphonesimulator SKIP_INSTALL=NO BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES
   ```
7. Analyzed the error message:
   ```
   script.sh: line 46: 11496 Killed: 9
   ```

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified, but it appeared to be related to the interaction between the EPP settings and the Xcode build process. The inconsistent behavior among users suggested that local configurations or permissions might have played a role.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by conducting a remote session with the affected users to analyze their configurations and settings. During this session, adjustments were made to the EPP settings and user permissions, which allowed all users to run the framework successfully without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that all users have consistent configurations and permissions when working with EPP and Xcode.
- If issues arise, consider conducting remote sessions to analyze user environments directly.
- Document any specific user configurations that may differ, as they can lead to inconsistent behavior.
