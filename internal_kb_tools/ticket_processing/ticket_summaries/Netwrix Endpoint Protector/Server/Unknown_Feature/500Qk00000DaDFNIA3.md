- **Case Number:** 416198
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Klinkhammer Intralogistics GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Maguy Aspe
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Virtual Appliance
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer was unable to access the Virtual Appliance prior to a Proof of Concept (POC) Kick-Off meeting. They reported receiving an error message during booting and were unable to access the web interface despite having a valid IP address.

## Environment Details
- The Virtual Appliance was expected to be accessible via the IP address `192.168.100.6`.
- The customer attempted to access the appliance using HTTPS but was unsuccessful.
- The customer confirmed that the VM had internet access through ports 80 and 443.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer was using the correct IP address (`192.168.100.6`) and not an external IP (`111.33.33.111`).
2. Advised the customer to use HTTPS for access instead of HTTP.
3. Suggested checking the network settings and firewall configurations.
4. Reviewed the logs for any potential issues.
5. Verified that the VM had internet access.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Virtual Appliance missing a second network card, which was not clearly specified in the manual. This omission prevented proper network communication and access to the web interface.

## Solution
The resolution involved adding the second network card to the Virtual Appliance. Once the second network card was configured, the customer was able to access the Virtual Appliance successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the documentation clearly states the requirement for multiple network cards for the Virtual Appliance to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify network configurations and access methods (HTTP vs. HTTPS) when troubleshooting connectivity issues.
