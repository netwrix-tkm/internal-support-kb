- **Case Number:** 441103
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DRAFTSPOTTING TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED
- **Contact Name:** Rajesh Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** 7.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to increase the disk size for their Endpoint Protector server hosted on Google Cloud.

## Environment Details
- **Hosting Platform:** Google Cloud
- **Virtualization Environment:** Not specified, but relevant to the snapshot requirement (VMWare, HyperV, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to gather availability for a remote session.
2. Requested the customer to prepare a snapshot of the Endpoint Protector appliance prior to the remote session for safety.
3. Scheduled a remote session for April 11, 2025, at 12:30 IST.
4. Conducted the remote session to increase the disk space and optimize the server.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to insufficient disk space on the Endpoint Protector server, which required an increase to accommodate the customer's needs.

## Solution
During the remote session on April 11, 2025, the technical support engineer successfully increased the disk space and optimized the server settings. The changes were implemented without any issues, resolving the customer's request.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always prepare a snapshot of the server before making significant changes to ensure a rollback option is available in case of unexpected issues.
- Future requests for disk space increases should follow a similar protocol of scheduling a remote session and preparing necessary backups.
