## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the EPP server running out of space, specifically stating that they were unable to delete Shadow File Copies from the management server.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the storage usage on the management server.
2. Attempted to delete Shadow File Copies directly from the management interface.
3. Checked for any permissions or access issues that might prevent deletion.
4. Reviewed server logs for any error messages related to file deletion.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an accumulation of Shadow File Copies that had not been deleted, leading to insufficient disk space on the management server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting over 180 GB of Shadow File Copies from the management server, which freed up the necessary disk space.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor and manage Shadow File Copies to prevent similar disk space issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup processes for Shadow File Copies to maintain optimal server performance and storage availability.
