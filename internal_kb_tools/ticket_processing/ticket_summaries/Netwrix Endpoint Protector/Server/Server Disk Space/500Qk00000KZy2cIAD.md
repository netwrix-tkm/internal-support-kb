## Problem Description
The client reported experiencing significant slowness when accessing their Data Loss Prevention (DLP) portal, necessitating urgent investigation.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to disk space utilization on the server hosting the DLP portal.
- Two primary folders were identified as consuming excessive disk space: "backup" and "mysql".

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Analyzed the disk space usage on the server.
2. Identified that the "backup" folder contained numerous older automatic SQL backups that were rarely needed.
3. Noted that the "mysql" folder, which contains the live database, was also large due to the accumulation of older event logs.
4. Proposed cleaning up the "backup" folder by retaining only the last three backups.
5. Recommended using audit log backups and archiving older event logs from the "mysql" folder to external storage.
6. Conducted a backend procedure to clear older automatic SQL backups.
7. Assisted the customer in running an audit log backup to delete unnecessary older event logs.

## Root Cause
The slowness of the DLP portal was primarily caused by insufficient disk space due to the accumulation of unnecessary older backups and event logs, which hindered server performance.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting older automatic SQL backups from the "backup" folder, retaining only the last three backups.
- Running an audit log backup to remove older event logs from the "mysql" folder, thereby freeing up disk space and improving server performance.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor disk space usage and perform maintenance on backup and log files to prevent similar performance issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a scheduled cleanup procedure for older backups and logs to maintain optimal server performance.
