## Problem Description
The customer, Seluz Kimya, reported issues with uninstalling an agent from their server (ID: WNLBBWVW). The uninstallation process was incomplete, preventing any further installation or uninstallation attempts. The system prompted for a password that was not accepted. Additionally, the customer received a warning indicating that the server disk was full.

## Environment Details
- **Server ID:** WNLBBWVW
- **Customer Name:** Seluz Kimya

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request and gathered initial details about the issue.
2. Attempted to uninstall the agent through the interface, which failed due to password prompts.
3. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the uninstallation issue and disk space warning.
4. Conducted a remote session to diagnose and resolve the problems.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the uninstallation process of the agent, which left remnants that blocked further attempts to uninstall or install the agent. The full disk space warning was likely a consequence of the incomplete uninstallation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session where the technician was able to:
- Forcefully remove the remnants of the agent that were preventing proper uninstallation.
- Clear up disk space on the server, allowing for normal operations to resume.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future uninstallation processes are monitored for completion to avoid similar issues.
- If a password prompt occurs during uninstallation, verify the credentials and consider using administrative privileges.
- Regularly check disk space on servers to prevent operational disruptions.
