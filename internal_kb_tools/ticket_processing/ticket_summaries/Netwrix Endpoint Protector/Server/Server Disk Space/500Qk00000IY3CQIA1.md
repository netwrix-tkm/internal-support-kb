## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IY3CQIA1
- **Case Number:** 427611
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Laykon Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Yağız Özkütük
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their disk space was full, and although it was increased via remote access by the support team, they continued to experience the same issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the server's disk space management within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the previous ticket (Ticket Number: 00425889) to understand the initial resolution.
2. Scheduled a remote access session for November 21 to further investigate the disk space issue.
3. Cleared unnecessary files and data from the server during the remote session.
4. Extended the hard disk drive (HDD) capacity to 1.2TB.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that, despite the initial increase in disk space, the server was still retaining a significant amount of unnecessary data, which continued to fill the available space.

## Solution
During the remote session on November 21, the support engineer cleared the unnecessary data from the server and successfully extended the HDD capacity to 1.2TB. The changes took approximately 20 minutes to reflect in the system under Appliance > Server information.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space usage and perform maintenance to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need for periodic data cleanup to optimize disk space utilization.
