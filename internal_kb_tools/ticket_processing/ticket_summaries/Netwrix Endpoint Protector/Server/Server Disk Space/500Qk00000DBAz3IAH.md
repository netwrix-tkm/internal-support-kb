- **Contact Name:** Antoine Chauvet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running out of disk space and requested assistance on how to free up space. They mentioned that they had attempted to follow the documentation but were unsuccessful.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session via Zoom for a disk clean-up.
2. The customer was instructed to have Putty installed on their computer to allow SSH access to the server.
3. A remote session was scheduled for July 18, 2024, at 11:00 CET.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was implied that the accumulation of unnecessary files or logs may have contributed to the issue.

## Solution
During the remote session, the support engineer performed a clean-up of the disk, which included clearing the mailer and potentially other unnecessary files. This action successfully freed up disk space on the appliance.

## Notes
- It is recommended for customers to regularly monitor disk space and perform clean-ups as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that any critical data is backed up before performing disk clean-up operations to avoid accidental data loss.
