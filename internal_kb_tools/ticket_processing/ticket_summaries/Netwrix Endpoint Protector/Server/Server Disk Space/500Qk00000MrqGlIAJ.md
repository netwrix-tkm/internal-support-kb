## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MrqGlIAJ
- **Case Number:** 438638
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** UCLA Health
- **Contact Name:** Eric Caparros
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Disk Space
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving frequent low disk space messages on their server, indicating that the system was running out of available disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reviewed previous cases related to low disk space (cases 00431160, 00425756, 00419293, 00412524).
2. Requested customer approval for backend access to the EPP server to investigate the issue further.
3. Cleared space on the system disk after receiving customer approval.
4. Confirmed the disk space usage was reduced to 51% after the cleanup.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was determined that the disk space had become critically low, prompting the frequent alerts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing unnecessary files from the system disk, which allowed the disk space usage to drop to 51%. The customer was informed to allow 10-15 minutes for the changes to replicate on their end.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
- Customers should be advised to maintain adequate free space on their servers to avoid operational disruptions.
- Future cases may benefit from a proactive approach to disk space management, including scheduled cleanups or alerts for low disk space thresholds.
