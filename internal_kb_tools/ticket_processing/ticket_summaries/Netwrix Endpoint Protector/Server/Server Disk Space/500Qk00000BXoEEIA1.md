- **Case Number:** 411310
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hughes Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Zach Metz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a message indicating that the appliance is running low on disk space, despite performing regular backups and deleting old backups. The customer sought assistance in checking the actual remaining space on the server.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a server running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer had recently switched to a new SIEM platform and did not have logs from November 2023.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Eduard Nut, checked the backend disk space and removed some old backup files.
2. Noted the presence of numerous syslog-ng files, which could indicate an issue with the SIEM integration.
3. Suggested the customer turn off and then back on the SIEM integration to see if it resolved the low disk space message.
4. The customer confirmed that after restarting the integration, the low disk space message disappeared and logs were still being received.

## Root Cause
The low disk space warning was likely caused by the accumulation of syslog-ng files due to an error with the SIEM integration, which was not properly managing log files.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Restarting the SIEM integration, which cleared the low disk space warning.
- Ongoing monitoring of the disk space and logs to ensure that the issue does not recur.

## Notes
- The customer reported that the low disk space message reappeared after some time, indicating that further investigation into the syslog-ng files and their management may be necessary.
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk space and log file sizes, especially after changes to integration settings or backup configurations.
