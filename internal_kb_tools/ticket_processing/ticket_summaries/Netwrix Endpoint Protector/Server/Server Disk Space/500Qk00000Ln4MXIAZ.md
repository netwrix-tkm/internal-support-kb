## Problem Description
The customer requested upgrade files to upgrade their air-gapped server from version 5.7.1.0 to the latest version.

## Environment Details
- The server is air-gapped, meaning it is isolated from external networks, which complicates the upgrade process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Joined a remote session with the customer (Hamad) to discuss the upgrade process.
2. Identified a miscommunication regarding access to the air-gapped server.
3. Presented two options to the customer:
   - Remote access through a KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse).
   - Providing an offline patch with an additional account for backend access, requiring a signed disclaimer.
4. Agreed with the customer to proceed with the KVM option for the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a miscommunication regarding the access methods available for the air-gapped server, which limited the options for performing the upgrade.

## Solution
The customer decided to pursue the KVM option for the upgrade. They will seek internal approval before proceeding. The case was closed with the understanding that a new ticket would be opened once they are ready to continue.

## Notes
- Ensure clear communication regarding access methods for air-gapped servers in future cases.
- Advise customers on the implications of using offline patches, including the need for disclaimers to limit liability for potential damages.
