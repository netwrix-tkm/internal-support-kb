- **Case Number:** 425508
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Daycoval
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Daycoval, requested assistance to expand and optimize a server that supports 4000 computers. They specifically needed help with expanding the server's disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Size:** 4000 computers
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a call for server expansion and optimization.
2. Expanded RAM and vCPUs on the server backend during the call.
3. Investigated the disk space expansion request.
4. Noted that the disk drive did not appear to be expanded from the virtual machine.
5. Assisted in resolving a firewall issue that was preventing access to the liveupdate server.

## Root Cause
The disk space expansion was not reflected in the virtual machine, indicating that the disk had not been properly expanded on the backend.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Successfully expanding the RAM and vCPUs on the server.
- Addressing the firewall issue that was blocking access to the liveupdate server.
- Further investigation may be required to ensure that the disk space expansion is correctly reflected in the virtual machine settings.

## Notes
- Ensure that any disk space expansions are verified on the virtual machine after backend adjustments.
- Monitor firewall settings to prevent access issues to critical servers like the liveupdate server in the future.
