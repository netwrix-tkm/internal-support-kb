- **Case Number:** 440412
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Terry Hines & Associates
- **Contact Name:** Norm Hayes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Disk Space
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they could not access their hosted Endpoint Protector at the URL `https://tq9ta2b.hosted.endpointprotector.com`.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the backend of the Endpoint Protector server, specifically concerning log management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the backend of the Endpoint Protector server.
2. Confirmed that the log partition was full (100%).
3. Cleared as much space as possible from the log partition.
4. Noted the presence of approximately 15 million logs and 47 million file trace logs.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the log partition being completely full, which prevented access to the Endpoint Protector user interface.

## Solution
To resolve the issue:
- The customer was advised to use the Audit Log backup functionality to archive existing logs and remove them from the Endpoint Protector server. This can be done via:
  - **System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup**
- Additionally, it was recommended to reduce the number of computers that file tracing applies to or to disable the file tracing functionality altogether, as it generates a significant amount of logs. This can be adjusted in:
  - **Device Control -> Global Settings -> File Tracing -> deselect it**
- After these actions, the user interface of the Endpoint Protector server became accessible again.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly manage and archive logs to prevent the log partition from filling up.
- Consider implementing a log retention policy to automatically manage log sizes and prevent similar issues in the future.
