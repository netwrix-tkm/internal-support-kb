- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space

## Problem Description
The customer requested a review of their server configuration, specifically to assess the need for increased server storage size and the appropriate method to achieve this.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server had been online for over 180 days without a reboot.
- Current server specifications included a CPU core count of 2 and 4 GB of RAM.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared space on the server.
2. Rebooted the EPP server.
3. Reviewed existing policies.
4. Checked server resources and performance metrics.
5. Recommended increasing the CPU core count from 2 to 4.
6. Suggested increasing the RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB for better performance.
7. Discussed the Audit Log Backup feature to manage log retention and archiving.

## Root Cause
The server was under-resourced for its operational demands, leading to performance issues. The long uptime without a reboot may have contributed to resource exhaustion.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing unnecessary space on the server.
- Rebooting the server to refresh system resources.
- Implementing recommendations to increase CPU and RAM specifications to enhance performance.
- Advising on the configuration of the Audit Log Backup to manage log retention effectively.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the File Shadows setting in the Device Control -> Global Settings section, as this may also contribute to space consumption over time.
- Regular reviews of server performance and resource allocation are recommended to prevent similar issues in the future.
