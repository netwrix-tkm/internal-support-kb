- **Case Number:** 439270
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sodexo
- **Contact Name:** Vignesh Haldankar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** 20.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Endpoint Protector appliance was running low on disk space, which could potentially affect the functionality of the EPP server. They requested assistance in freeing up space.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the disk space on the Endpoint Protector appliance.
- The appliance was connected remotely for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely to the appliance with the customer (Vignesh) and support engineer (Adrian).
2. Logged into the appliance via SSH.
3. Removed old backup files from the following directories:
   - `/var/eppfiles/logbackup`
   - `/var/log/backups`
4. Deleted backups that were older than 6 months.
5. Noted that there were 89GB of shadow copies due to the Audit Log Backup, which would also be removed to free up additional space.

## Root Cause
The low disk space issue was primarily caused by the accumulation of old backup files and shadow copies that were not regularly cleared out.

## Solution
- The removal of old backup files cleared more than 50% of the storage space on the appliance.
- The shadowing option was turned off to prevent future accumulation of unnecessary data.
- The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved after the cleanup.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor and manage backup files and shadow copies to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup scripts or policies to manage disk space effectively.
