## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JQ5h4IAD
- **Case Number:** 429687
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Palo Pinto General Hospital
- **Contact Name:** Greg Donham
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server was running low on disk space, despite having previously expanded the drive on the VMware server side. They requested assistance to expand the drive again.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server Disk Space: 98 GB used out of 361 GB allocated.
- System Disk Space: 66% used from 50 GB.
- The customer had cleaned logs approximately six months prior.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current disk space allocation for both the System and EPP Server.
2. Accessed the EPP Server backend to attempt to clean out files.
3. Cleared System Alert logs from the EPP Server.
4. Verified SMTP settings and alert configurations.
5. Recommended disabling specific alerts to prevent future notifications.
6. Customer created a snapshot of the VM before proceeding with the disk expansion.
7. Performed the disk expansion on the EPP server, increasing the allocated storage to 429.57 GB.
8. Rebooted the VM and verified the storage adjustment from the backend.
9. Configured Audit log backups to be saved on an external network drive.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the accumulation of alert logs and insufficient disk space management, which led to the EPP server reporting low disk space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Expanding the disk space on the EPP server to 429.57 GB.
- Clearing the alert logs from the EPP Server, which freed up significant space.
- Setting up the Audit log backups to be stored on an external network drive to manage disk space more effectively.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk space and clean logs to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider configuring alerts judiciously to avoid unnecessary notifications while ensuring critical alerts are still received.
- The customer expressed a desire to retain logs for future reference, so a backup strategy should be discussed to accommodate this need without compromising disk space.
