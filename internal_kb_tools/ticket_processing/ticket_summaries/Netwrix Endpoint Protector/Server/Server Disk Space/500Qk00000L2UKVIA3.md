## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L2UKVIA3
- **Case Number:** 433499
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hughes Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Zach Metz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their server was running low on disk space, displaying a warning message in the EPP console indicating only 6.61 GB of free space available from a total of 19.52 GB (34%). The message suggested that EPP Server functionality and performance could be severely affected. Despite deleting many old backups, the warning persisted, and the customer was unable to perform client software upgrades through the console.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Log File Path:** `/usr/local/logs/php-fpm.log`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer deleted old system and audit log backups to free up space.
2. Customer attempted to perform client software upgrades through the console, which failed.
3. Investigation revealed that the PHP log file was writing logs continuously, contributing to the disk space issue.
4. The PHP log file was cleared to free up disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the disk space issue was identified as the PHP log file (`/usr/local/logs/php-fpm.log`) continuously writing logs, which gradually filled up the available disk space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the PHP log file, which immediately improved the disk space situation. The customer was advised to check with the server team about the possibility of disabling logging for this file to prevent future occurrences.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor log file sizes regularly to prevent similar disk space issues.
- Consider implementing log rotation or limiting the log file size to manage disk space effectively.
- Future upgrades or maintenance should be planned with adequate disk space in mind to avoid performance degradation.
