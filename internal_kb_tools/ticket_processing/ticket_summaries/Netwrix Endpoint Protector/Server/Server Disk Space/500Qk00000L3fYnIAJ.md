- **Case Number:** 433588
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OHSU - Oregon Health & Science University
- **Contact Name:** Jacques Perrolle
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message indicating that the appliance was running low on disk space, with only 6.83 GB free from a total of 19.52 GB (35% available). The message warned that the functionality and performance of the EPP Server may be severely affected. The customer attempted to resolve the issue by removing logs and adjusting the audit time frame, but the problem persisted, along with slow interface response times.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Error message about low disk space
  - Slow interface response, particularly when accessing Appliance > Server Information
  - Interface freezing, taking up to 60 seconds or longer to populate

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Removed all logs from the host.
2. Changed the audit time frame from monthly to weekly.
3. Attempted to access Appliance > Server Information multiple times to check for performance issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it is likely related to the accumulation of logs and insufficient disk space, which can affect the performance of the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the customer after performing the following actions:
- Utilizing the Audit Log Backup feature to manage and reduce the logs stored in the database.
- Deleting older system and audit log backups to free up disk space.
- Tuning policies to reduce the incoming log count.

The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly monitor disk space and manage log files to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated log management policies to maintain optimal disk space usage.
- Users should be aware that performance issues can arise when disk space is critically low, impacting server functionality.
