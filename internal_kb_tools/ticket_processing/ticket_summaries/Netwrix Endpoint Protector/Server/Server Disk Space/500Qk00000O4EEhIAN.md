- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O4EEhIAN
- **Case Number:** 442074
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** LayaTech
- **Contact Name:** Rajesh Krish
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a "Disk High Utilization" alert in the Endpoint Protector UI console. Despite deleting old audit logs, the alert persisted, prompting the need for immediate assistance.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer had already attempted to manage disk space by deleting old audit logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to assess disk usage.
2. Cleared disk space by removing shadows older than 30 days and some older backups during the session.
3. Discussed the possibility of increasing disk space with the customer.
4. Scheduled a follow-up remote session to increase disk space after customer confirmation.
5. Increased disk space during the follow-up session.

## Root Cause
The initial high disk utilization was due to accumulated data, including old audit logs and backup shadows, which were not adequately managed prior to the support intervention.

## Solution
- Successfully removed unnecessary data (shadows older than 30 days and older backups) to free up disk space.
- Increased the disk space on the Endpoint Protector server, which resolved the high utilization alert.
- The changes were confirmed to be reflected in the UI console after the adjustments.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk usage and manage old data to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always take a snapshot of the virtual machine before making significant changes to the disk configuration to ensure a rollback option is available if needed.
