- **Case Number:** 417168
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TrustingSocial
- **Contact Name:** Linh Hoang
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a discrepancy in the allocated disk space for a virtual machine (VM). Initially, a persistent disk was set to 320GB, but during a recent session, it was observed that only approximately 120GB was allocated by the EP server. The customer inquired about the missing 200GB of disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Persistent Disk Size:** 320GB (initially set)
- **Allocated Disk Space:** ~120GB (observed during the last session)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the initial configuration of the persistent disk for the VM.
2. Conducted a session to verify the total disk space allocated by the EP server.
3. Investigated the settings and configurations related to disk space allocation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the disk space allocation settings, which resulted in only a portion of the allocated disk space being recognized by the EP server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by increasing the disk space allocation for the VM. This adjustment allowed the full 320GB of persistent disk space to be recognized and utilized by the EP server.

## Notes
- Ensure that disk space configurations are regularly reviewed to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Document any changes made to disk configurations for future reference and troubleshooting.
