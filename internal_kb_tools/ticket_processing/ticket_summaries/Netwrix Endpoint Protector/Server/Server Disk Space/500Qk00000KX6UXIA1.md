- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Samsung Electronics Company
- **Contact Name:** Komal Rani
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported the need to extend the disk space on a new EPP server (migrating from an old server - QOFOZ33V) from approximately 250 GB to 1 TB due to low disk space warnings on the old server.

## Environment Details
- Old EPP Server: QOFOZ33V
- New EPP Server: Not specified
- Disk space requirement: Extend from 250 GB to 1 TB

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to assess the disk space issue.
2. Verified the current disk space allocation on both the old and new servers.
3. Cleared disk space on the root partition of the old server to resolve the low disk space warning.
4. Performed disk extensions for both the old and new servers.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to insufficient disk space allocated to the new EPP server, which was inherited from the old server. The low disk space warning on the old server indicated that the existing allocation was inadequate for operational needs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Extending the disk space on both the old and new EPP servers to meet the required capacity of 1 TB.
- Clearing unnecessary files on the root partition of the old server to alleviate the low disk space warning.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- When migrating servers, verify disk space requirements beforehand to avoid operational disruptions.
- Consider implementing alerts for low disk space to proactively manage storage needs.
