- **Case Number:** 423908
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Avrioc Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Aghillal Marath
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Disk Space
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Netwrix DLP tenant was running low on disk space, with over 75% of storage already consumed during the implementation phase. They expressed concerns that this would not be sufficient once they went live at full capacity, potentially requiring weekly log clearing.

## Environment Details
- The appliance had 43.03 GB free out of 237.54 GB (18% remaining).
- The customer was experiencing issues due to a high volume of repetitive logs (approximately 300 million) related to `.uasset` file extensions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the disk space usage and confirmed the high volume of logs.
2. Conducted a remote session to analyze the file tracing settings.
3. Recommended excluding `.uasset` file extensions from file tracing to reduce log entries.
4. Discussed the configuration of audit log backups to manage log retention effectively.
5. Advised the customer to run the audit log backup while ensuring to uncheck "Keep backed up logs" and "Keep backed up shadows".

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space was identified as the excessive number of logs generated from file tracing, particularly due to the `.uasset` file extensions, which resulted in a significant increase in the database size.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to:
- Exclude `.uasset` file extensions from file tracing to reduce the number of logs generated.
- Configure audit log backups to manage log retention effectively, ensuring that older logs are backed up and removed from the live database.
- The customer was also encouraged to evaluate other file extensions for exclusion after internal discussions.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to regularly review their file tracing settings to avoid excessive log generation.
- Customers should consider configuring audit log backups to maintain optimal disk space usage and performance.
- Future implementations should include discussions on log retention policies to prevent similar issues.
