## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FAy5VIAT
- **Case Number:** 419699
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Shield Force
- **Contact Name:** Jose Luis Vera Garcia
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** v5.7.1 (attempted upgrade to v5.9)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Netwrix Endpoint Protector tenant was running low on disk space, which prevented them from upgrading to version 5.9. They received a warning indicating that only 31% of disk space was available, and they were concerned about losing historical events while trying to free up space.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** v5.7.1
- **Attempted Upgrade Version:** v5.9
- **Available Disk Space:** 82.27 GB free from 267.07 GB total (31%)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the warning message regarding low disk space.
2. Advised the customer to use the Audit Log Backup feature to reduce the logs stored in the database.
3. Suggested deleting older system and audit log backups.
4. Recommended tuning policies to reduce the incoming log count.
5. Conducted a remote session to assist with the backup and space management.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by insufficient disk space on the server, which was below the threshold required for the upgrade process. The accumulation of logs and backups contributed to the low disk space.

## Solution
During a remote session, the following actions were taken to resolve the issue:
- The customer was guided through the process of using the Audit Log Backup feature to archive and delete unnecessary logs.
- Older system and audit log backups were identified and removed to free up space.
- Policies were adjusted to limit the volume of incoming logs, thereby preventing future occurrences of low disk space.

## Notes
- It is crucial to monitor disk space regularly, especially before performing upgrades.
- Customers should be encouraged to implement a routine cleanup of logs and backups to maintain optimal disk space levels.
- Future upgrades should be planned with adequate disk space in mind to avoid similar issues.
