## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Dz1MJIAZ
- **Case Number:** 416988
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bob Card
- **Contact Name:** BOB CARD
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** 16.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP server's storage space was running low, with only 20% free space remaining. They requested assistance to free up storage on the server.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Current Disk Usage:** 80% utilized, 20% free space

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked the current disk space usage on the EPP server.
2. Verified the functionality of the Audit Log backup process.
3. Assessed the overall storage management settings and configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the accumulation of data in the Audit Log, which had not been properly managed, leading to reduced available storage space.

## Solution
After reviewing the disk space, it was confirmed that the Audit Log backup had executed successfully. This action resulted in a reduction of disk usage to 13% (approximately 55GB used), thereby resolving the low storage issue.

## Notes
- Regular monitoring of disk space and scheduled backups of the Audit Log are recommended to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing alerts for low disk space thresholds to proactively manage storage resources.
