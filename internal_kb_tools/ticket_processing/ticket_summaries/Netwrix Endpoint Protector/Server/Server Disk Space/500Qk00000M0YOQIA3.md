## Problem Description
The customer reported that their server was losing free space at an alarming rate, indicating a critical issue with disk usage on the system partition.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Initially Ubuntu 14, migrated to Ubuntu 22.04
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.1.0

## Root Cause
The rapid loss of disk space was caused by excessive usage of the `/tmp` folder, which was a result of the outdated Ubuntu 14 operating system.
