- **Case Number:** 439414
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Senior Helpers
- **Contact Name:** Flakron Salihu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Disk Space
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a message indicating that the server had low disk space and requested guidance on how to clear old logs without causing issues. They also considered enabling the "HDD Disk Space - Safety Logs Rotation" option in the System Status.

## Environment Details
- The System Disk partition had approximately 20GB of total space.
- Around 7-10GB (up to 50% of total disk size) was occupied by vital components of the EPP server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reported the low disk space issue.
2. Technical support requested approval to access the backend of the EPP server to clear space.
3. Upon receiving approval, support accessed the backend and cleared space related to alerts and journal entries.
4. Informed the customer that changes would take 10-15 minutes to replicate in the UI.

## Root Cause
The low disk space alert was triggered because the disk usage reached a threshold of 60%. The server's functionality was not affected at this level, but it indicated that the disk was nearing capacity.

## Solution
- Cleared space in the backend of the EPP server, which primarily involved removing old alerts and journal entries.
- After the cleanup, the disk usage was reduced to approximately 48%, allowing for normal server operation.

## Notes
- The alert system is set to trigger at 60% disk usage; however, the server can function normally with 35% disk free.
- Future issues may arise if disk usage approaches 95-100%.
- The customer was advised that they could contact support again if they needed further assistance with disk space management.
- Concerns regarding the size of the partition (20GB) were raised internally for potential future increases.
