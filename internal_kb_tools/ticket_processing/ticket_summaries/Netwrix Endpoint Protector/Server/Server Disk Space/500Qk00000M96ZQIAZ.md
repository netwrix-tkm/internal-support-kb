- **Case Number:** 436560
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Desktop - End user
- **Contact Name:** Alberto Mori
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported low disk space on their EPP Server, which was at 9% capacity. The issue was primarily due to excessive file shadows consuming 79% of the disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to assess the disk space usage.
2. Identified that file shadows were utilizing a significant portion of the disk space.
3. Deleted file shadows older than 60 days as per customer request.
4. Cleared the "backup" folder, which contained automatic backups, retaining only the last three backups for emergency restoration.
5. After deletions, confirmed that the disk space utilization decreased to 60%.
6. Scheduled future maintenance to:
   - Run audit log backups every 2 weeks.
   - Delete file shadows and logs older than 2 months.

## Root Cause
The excessive disk space usage was caused by the accumulation of file shadows and older automatic backups that were not regularly cleaned up.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting file shadows older than 60 days.
- Cleaning up the "backup" folder to retain only the most recent backups.
- Implementing a scheduled maintenance plan to manage disk space more effectively in the future.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space and implement automated cleanup processes to prevent similar issues.
- Retaining only a few recent backups is generally sufficient for emergency restoration, reducing unnecessary disk usage.
