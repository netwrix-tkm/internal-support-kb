## Problem Description
The customer requested the removal of shadow copies on the EPP server that are older than 30 days or a reduction of the shadow retention period from 60 days to 30 days due to server space issues.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Identified shadow copies older than 30 days.
3. Executed the removal of shadow copies that were older than the specified duration.

## Root Cause
The server was running low on disk space due to the accumulation of shadow copies, which were retained for 60 days, exceeding the customer's desired retention period.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing shadow copies that were older than 30 days, thereby freeing up disk space on the EPP server.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor shadow copy retention settings to prevent similar disk space issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a scheduled task to automatically remove shadow copies older than a specified duration to maintain optimal server performance.
