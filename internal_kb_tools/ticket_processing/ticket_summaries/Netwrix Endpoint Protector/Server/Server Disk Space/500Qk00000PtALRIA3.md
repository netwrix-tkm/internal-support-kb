## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Epp server's disk space was critically low at 1%, preventing access to the server terminal and necessitating assistance to remove data older than one month.

## Environment Details
- The server was running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue was related to file shadows not being regularly deleted, leading to low disk space.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server's disk space was at 1%.
2. Identified that the customer could not access the server terminal for maintenance tasks.
3. Noted the need for a remote support session to address the disk space issue.
4. Discussed the importance of deleting file shadows older than 14 days to free up disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the accumulation of old file shadows that were not deleted regularly, leading to critically low disk space on the server.

## Solution
During a remote support session, the support engineer deleted file shadows older than 14 days from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server. This action successfully increased the available disk space from 1% to 21%, resolving the immediate issue and restoring normal server operation.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor disk usage and schedule regular cleanups of old file shadows to prevent future occurrences.
- If disk space issues or terminal access problems persist, the customer was instructed to open a new support ticket.
- The customer was also advised to follow up on a separate ticket regarding external storage with the assigned support engineer.
- Support can provide documentation or automation options for regular disk cleanup if requested by the customer.
