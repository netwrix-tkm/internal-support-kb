- **Account/Company:** AATMIA DIGITAL MARKETING AND SECURITY PRIVATE LIMITED

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their CoSoSys DLP Server was unable to boot up due to a filesystem error on the root partition (`/dev/sda4`). The error message indicated that the filesystem contained errors and required a manual filesystem check (fsck).

## Environment Details
- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
- Affected Component: CoSoSys DLP Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested additional information from the customer regarding the impact of the issue, affected users, and any troubleshooting steps already attempted.
2. The customer confirmed that they had not attempted any troubleshooting steps prior to contacting support.
3. The support engineer advised the customer to take a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance for safety.
4. The customer was instructed to run the command:
   ```bash
   e2fsck -f /dev/sda4
   ```
5. After executing the command, the customer was asked to check if the server could boot up successfully.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as filesystem corruption on the root partition (`/dev/sda4`), which led to an unexpected inconsistency that prevented the server from booting.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running the `e2fsck -f /dev/sda4` command, which fixed the filesystem errors. After the command completed successfully, the customer was able to boot up the CoSoSys DLP Server without further issues.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly check the filesystem integrity and perform maintenance to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always take a snapshot of the virtual machine before performing filesystem repairs to ensure a rollback option is available in case of unexpected outcomes.
