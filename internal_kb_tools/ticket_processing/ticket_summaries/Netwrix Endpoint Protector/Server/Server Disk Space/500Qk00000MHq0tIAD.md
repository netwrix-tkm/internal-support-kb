- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wildflower Health
- **Contact Name:** Brad Dunbar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message indicating that their hosted instance of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector appliance was running low on disk space, with only 6.56 GB free out of 19.52 GB (34%). The message warned that server functionality and performance could be severely affected.

## Environment Details
- Hosted instance of Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- Disk space utilization: 6.56 GB free from 19.52 GB total

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to run the audit log backup four times on logs older than one year.
2. Customer reported that the error message persisted and the consumed disk space did not decrease.
3. Support technician received customer approval to access the backend of the hosted EPP appliance.
4. Performed a cleaning-up procedure on the backend to free up disk space.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by an accumulation of logs and backups that were not being cleared effectively by the audit log backup process, leading to insufficient disk space.

## Solution
After gaining access to the backend of the hosted EPP appliance, the support technician executed a cleaning-up procedure that successfully removed unnecessary logs and backups, thereby freeing up disk space and resolving the error message.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk space and perform log clean-up procedures to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to periodically review their log retention policies to ensure they are not retaining excessive amounts of data that could lead to disk space issues.
