## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LgLC1IAN
- **Case Number:** 435204
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dubai Police
- **Contact Name:** Fakhra Abdulla
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported critical low disk space on the EPP server and requested assistance in removing file shadows. They wanted to verify if the file shadows on the server matched those on external storage before proceeding with any deletions.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Recommended a meeting to compare file shadows on the server and external storage.
2. Verified the functionality of the external storage.
3. Removed file shadows from the EPP server after confirming they were redundant.

## Root Cause
The low disk space issue was primarily due to the accumulation of file shadows on the EPP server, which were not necessary as they were also stored on external storage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Confirming that the file shadows on the server were identical to those on the external storage.
- Disabling the "keep copy on server" option.
- Removing the redundant file shadows from the EPP server, thereby freeing up disk space.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor disk space and file shadow configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that any changes to file shadow settings are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders to avoid confusion.
