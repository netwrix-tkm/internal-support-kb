## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CWt0uIAD
- **Case Number:** 413634
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Iovance BioTherapeutics
- **Contact Name:** Michael Aquinde
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were running out of disk space on their server and requested recommendations for clearing up space.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on AWS.
- The EPP server had not been rebooted in over 500 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to schedule a remote session.
2. During the remote session, the following commands were executed to identify disk usage:
   ```bash
   du -sh /var/spool/*
   du -sh /var/log/*
   ```
3. The journal was vacuumed to reduce its size:
   ```bash
   journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
   ```
4. The filesystem reserved block percentage was adjusted:
   ```bash
   tune2fs -m 1 /dev/nvme0n1p4
   ```
5. Cleared memory cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /run/shm/mcache/*
   php /EPPServer/sieratool/symfony cc
   ```
6. Cleared PHP-FPM logs:
   ```bash
   echo '' > /usr/local/logs/php-fpm.log
   ```
7. Confirmed that approximately 5.88GB of free space was available after initial cleanup.
8. Discussed the need to open port 62828 for SSH access to the backend of the EPP server.

## Root Cause
The server had accumulated unnecessary files and logs over time, leading to low disk space. Additionally, the server had not been rebooted for an extended period, which may have contributed to the issue.

## Solution
- Cleared additional space on the System Disk during the remote session.
- Informed the customer to allow about 30 minutes for the changes to replicate on the EPP server UI.
- The ticket was closed after confirming the resolution with the customer.

## Notes
- Ensure regular maintenance and cleanup of server logs and caches to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Recommend scheduling periodic reboots for servers that have been running for extended periods without restart.
- Verify that necessary ports are open for remote access to facilitate troubleshooting.
