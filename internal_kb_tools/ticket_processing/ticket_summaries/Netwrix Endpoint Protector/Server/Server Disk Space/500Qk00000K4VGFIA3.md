## Problem Description
The customer reported a critical low disk space issue, indicated by a message displaying only 3% free disk space in the control panel. They were unable to delete logs due to session timeouts occurring after three minutes.

## Environment Details
- The issue was identified on the EPP Server, where file shadows had accumulated significantly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to analyze disk usage.
2. Discovered that file shadows were consuming over 40% of the disk space.
3. Extended the customer's `sda5` database partition by an additional 170 GB.
4. After the partition extension, confirmed that the disk space was increased to 41% free.
5. Instructed the customer to create a manual Audit Log Backup and ensure configurations matched a provided example.
6. Advised the customer to allow at least 49 hours for the audit log backup process to complete.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was the accumulation of file shadows, which consumed a significant portion of the EPP Server's disk space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by extending the database partition to increase available disk space. The customer was also guided to perform a manual Audit Log Backup, ensuring proper configuration to prevent future occurrences of low disk space.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to regularly monitor disk space and manage file shadows to avoid similar issues.
- Ensure that configurations for backups are verified against a known good example to prevent misconfigurations.
- Recommend scheduling regular maintenance checks to manage disk usage effectively.
