## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP (Endpoint Protector) storage had reduced to 16%, indicating a potential issue with disk space management.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session for further investigation.

## Root Cause

## Solution

## Notes

- Customers should be advised to periodically review and delete unnecessary files, such as shadows, to maintain optimal storage levels.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the process for managing storage and the potential impact of accumulated files on system performance.
