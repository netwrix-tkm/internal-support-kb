## Problem Description
The customer, Daycoval, reported that they were experiencing critical disk space issues across their network of approximately 4,500 computers, which required immediate assistance to clean up and manage disk space effectively.

## Environment Details
- **Client Size:** Approximately 4,500 computers
- **Platform:** Not specified (assumed to be on-premises or hosted)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to gather details about the issue.

3. Inquired about the current status of disk space and any relevant configurations (e.g., Audit backup, SIEM integrations, File Shadows).
4. Scheduled a meeting to discuss backend changes to expand disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient disk space across a large number of computers, likely due to inadequate management of disk usage and possibly a lack of regular maintenance or cleanup processes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing cleanup operations from the server's backend, which involved:
- Expanding the disk space as requested by the customer.
- Implementing cleanup strategies to manage disk usage effectively.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space usage, especially in environments with a large number of endpoints.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup scripts or policies to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the importance of regular maintenance and monitoring of their systems to avoid critical disk space issues.
