- **Contact Name:** Shaun Morris
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the system was indicating space constraints despite having cleared all possible logs. The customer recalled a previous instance where the issue was related to multiple records for the same printer in the printers table.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current disk space usage on the server.
2. Checked for any remaining log files or temporary files that could be consuming disk space.
3. Investigated the printers table for duplicate records as previously noted by the customer.
4. Cleared unnecessary files and confirmed the actions taken with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the space constraint issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was implied that the presence of multiple records for the same printer in the printers table may have contributed to the disk space consumption.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the disk space on the server. The customer confirmed that the disk space was adequate after the cleanup, allowing the ticket to be closed.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor the printers table for duplicate records to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that all unnecessary files are cleared periodically to maintain optimal disk space usage.
