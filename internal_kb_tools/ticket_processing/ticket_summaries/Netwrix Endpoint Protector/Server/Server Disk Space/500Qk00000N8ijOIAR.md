## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N8ijOIAR
- **Case Number:** 439474
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Genius Consultants Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Pravin B.
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server Disk Space
- **Feature:** Server
- **Version:** 20.03

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to access their Endpoint Protector (EPP) console due to storage issues. This was the third occurrence of storage exhaustion within a month, prompting a request for investigation into the root cause and a permanent resolution.

## Environment Details
- Server URL: [EPP Console](https://b8sond5.hosted.endpointprotector.com)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared some old backups to free up space.
2. Advised the customer to reduce the backup interval to prevent rapid storage exhaustion.
3. Suggested the customer create an Audit Log backup to manage storage better.
4. Accessed the backend of the server to investigate storage usage.
5. Identified that automatic backups and MySQL logs were consuming significant storage space.
6. Recommended archiving older event logs and deleting unnecessary ones.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the storage issue was the accumulation of automatic backups and MySQL logs, which were not being managed effectively. The older backups were rarely needed, leading to unnecessary consumption of disk space.

## Solution
- Cleared unnecessary backups, retaining only the first and last backups to maintain a minimal recovery point.
- Instructed the customer on how to set up Audit Log backups and manage the retention of event logs.
- Provided guidance on how to automate the backup and deletion of MySQL audit log files every 15 days to prevent future storage issues.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to regularly monitor their storage usage and manage backup settings to avoid similar issues.
- Customers using the cloud version of EPP should be aware that certain backup configurations may differ from on-premises setups.
