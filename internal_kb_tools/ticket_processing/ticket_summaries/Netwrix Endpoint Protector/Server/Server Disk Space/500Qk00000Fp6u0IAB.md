- **Case Number:** 421121
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SERSAPROSA
- **Contact Name:** Marisela Oliva
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving alerts from the management console indicating that the appliance was running low on disk space.

## Environment Details
The issue was related to the mailer component of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which was filling up due to alerts being generated without a configured SMTP server to send them out.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the alerts and identified that no SMTP server was configured.
2. Confirmed that alerts were being generated but not sent, causing accumulation in the mailer.
3. Removed all alerts to prevent further disk space usage.
4. Monitored the mailer for a few days to ensure disk space usage stabilized.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was identified as the mailer filling up with unsent alerts due to the absence of a configured SMTP server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing all alerts from the system, which stopped the accumulation of unsent emails in the mailer. The customer was advised to configure an SMTP server to handle alerts properly in the future.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to configure an SMTP server if they intend to use alerting features to prevent similar issues.
- Continuous monitoring of disk space is recommended after making configuration changes to ensure that the problem does not recur.
