- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Jeffrey Nigg Informatik AG - MSP

- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the disk space on their server was 95% full, and they were unable to identify the reason for the high disk usage.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a server running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- No specific product version was mentioned.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Andrei Pop, reached out to the customer to schedule a remote connection to investigate the issue further.
2. Several email exchanges occurred to confirm a suitable time for the remote session.
3. During the remote session, the support engineer checked the server's disk usage and identified that system backups were consuming a significant amount of disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the disk space issue was identified as excessive storage used by system backups on the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the system backups from the server, which freed up sufficient disk space and reduced the usage from 95% to an acceptable level.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor disk space usage and manage backups to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup processes for old backups to maintain optimal disk space levels.
