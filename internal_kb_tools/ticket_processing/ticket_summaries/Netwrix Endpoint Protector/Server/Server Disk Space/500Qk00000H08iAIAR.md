## Problem Description
Multiple users reported that they were unable to receive policies on their client machines, resulting in their devices being blocked. This issue arose during the Wave 4 of a multi-wave deployment, with incidents starting on 10/10/2024 and devices showing as blocked on 10/14/2024.

## Environment Details
- Deployment Phase: Wave 4 of a multi-wave deployment
- Last Seen Date: 10/10/2024
- Current Date: 10/14/2024

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated user reports regarding policy delivery failures.
2. Checked server disk space and logs for any anomalies.
3. Reviewed server configurations, particularly the web access log settings.
4. Confirmed that users were logged in but their devices were blocked.
5. Analyzed the server's disk space usage and log rotation settings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a full server disk, which was caused by a misconfigured web access log. The incorrect configuration prevented the server from processing requests properly, leading to policy delivery failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correcting the web access log configuration. The settings were adjusted to ensure that error logs were directed to the appropriate location, allowing for proper log rotation and preventing the disk from filling up. The root cause analysis (RCA) was provided to the customer on 10/22/2024.

## Notes
- Ensure that log rotation settings are correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor disk space regularly and set up alerts for low disk space to prevent service disruptions.
- Confirm that email settings for alerts are configured correctly to notify administrators of any disk space issues.
