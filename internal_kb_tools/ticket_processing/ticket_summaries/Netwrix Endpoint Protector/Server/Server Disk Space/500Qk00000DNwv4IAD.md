- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with performing log cleanup on their EPP Server and expanding disk space, as they were unable to reclaim sufficient disk space. Additionally, they expressed interest in discussing the upgrade process to the latest version of EPP.

## Environment Details
- **Server OS:** Not specified, but a comment indicated a new VM running on Ubuntu 22.

2. Attempted to identify and delete unnecessary log files to reclaim disk space.
3. Evaluated the possibility of expanding the disk space if no further space could be reclaimed.
4. Discussed the upgrade process for the EPP software with the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from insufficient disk space on the EPP Server, which was exacerbated by the accumulation of log files that had not been cleaned up regularly.

## Solution
The disk space was successfully expanded, allowing the server to operate without the immediate concern of running out of disk space. The customer was also provided with information regarding the upgrade process for the EPP software.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor and clean up log files to prevent similar disk space issues in the future.
- Consider scheduling periodic maintenance to review disk usage and perform necessary cleanups.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the upgrade process and any prerequisites that may be required before proceeding with an upgrade.
