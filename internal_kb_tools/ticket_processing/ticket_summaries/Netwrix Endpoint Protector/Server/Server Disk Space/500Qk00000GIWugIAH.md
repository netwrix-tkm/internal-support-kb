## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GIWugIAH
- **Case Number:** 422222
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Evive Health
- **Contact Name:** Kyle Beesley
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space, with only 3.54 GB free out of 40.69 GB (9% remaining). This low disk space was potentially affecting the functionality and performance of the EPP Server.

## Environment Details
- **Appliance Type:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Disk Space Status:** 3.54 GB free from 40.69 GB total

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Advised the customer to use the Audit Log Backup feature to reduce the logs stored in the database.
2. Suggested deleting older system and audit log backups.
3. Recommended tuning policies to reduce the incoming log count.
4. Investigated the SMTP configuration on the EPP server, as it was suspected to be incorrect or changed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was identified as an incorrect or altered SMTP configuration on the EPP server. This misconfiguration led to excessive space being occupied by mailer alerts generated by the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to review and correct the SMTP settings on the EPP server. The customer indicated they would consult a colleague to address the SMTP configuration, which should help mitigate the disk space issue caused by the alerts.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space and log generation settings to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that SMTP configurations are verified after any changes to avoid excessive log generation and disk space consumption.
