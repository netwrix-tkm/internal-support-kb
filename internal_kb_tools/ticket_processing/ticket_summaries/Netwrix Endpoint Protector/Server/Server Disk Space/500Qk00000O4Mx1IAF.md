## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O4Mx1IAF
- **Case Number:** 442088
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SwiftAnt
- **Contact Name:** Jeba Prince
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer upgraded their Azure SSD from 128 GB to 512 GB, but the additional storage space was not automatically reflected in the Endpoint Protector portal.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Azure
- **Previous Disk Size:** 128 GB SSD
- **New Disk Size:** 512 GB SSD

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the upgrade of the SSD from 128 GB to 512 GB in Azure.
2. Scheduled a remote session for 2025-04-16 to access the EPP appliance via SSH.
3. Informed the customer to prepare a snapshot of the Endpoint Protector appliance for safety.
4. Extended the root partition of the EPP appliance during the remote session.

## Root Cause
The additional storage space was not automatically allocated in the Endpoint Protector portal because a backend procedure was required to extend the root partition of the EPP appliance after the SSD upgrade.

## Solution
During the remote session on 2025-04-16, the technical support engineer accessed the EPP appliance via SSH and successfully extended the root partition. After this procedure, the customer confirmed that the additional storage space was now visible in the user interface.

## Notes
- It is crucial to perform a backend procedure to extend the root partition after upgrading disk sizes in Azure for the Endpoint Protector appliance.
- Always advise customers to take a snapshot of their appliance before making backend changes to ensure a quick recovery if needed.
