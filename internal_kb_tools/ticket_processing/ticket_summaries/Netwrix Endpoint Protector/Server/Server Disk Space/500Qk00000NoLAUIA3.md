## Problem Description
The customer reported a server disk space issue and requested assistance on how to add additional storage.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the server's disk space management within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The databases on the servers were significantly large, with sizes of 150 GB and 166 GB.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team scheduled a session with the customer to discuss the issue in detail.
2. During the session, the support team reviewed the current disk usage and retention settings for the Audit Log Backup.
3. It was determined that the large database sizes were contributing to the disk space issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the disk space issue was identified as the large size of the databases (150 GB and 166 GB) being retained for an extended period, which consumed significant disk space.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the support team recommended setting up the Audit Log Backup with a shorter retention time. This adjustment would help manage disk space more effectively by reducing the amount of data stored over time.

## Notes
- It is important for future reference to monitor database sizes and retention settings regularly to prevent similar disk space issues.
- Customers should be advised to consider adjusting retention periods based on their storage capacity and usage patterns.
