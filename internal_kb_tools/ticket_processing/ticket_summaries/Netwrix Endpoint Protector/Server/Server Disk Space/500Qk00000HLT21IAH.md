## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HLT21IAH
- **Case Number:** 424726
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arista Networks, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Bharani M
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported low disk space on a newer server, which persisted even after adding an extra 20GB on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They received a notification indicating only 3.4GB of space was available.

## Environment Details
- The server is running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The issue was related to audit logs and backups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the disk space status via the Appliance -> Server Information.
2. Suggested rebooting the server from the hypervisor.
3. Discussed the need for backend intervention to add the 20GB to the partition.
4. Cleared older files and logs as per customer request.
5. Monitored the disk space usage after the changes.

## Root Cause
The low disk space issue was primarily caused by audit logs that were not being rotated properly, leading to excessive disk usage. Additionally, there were backups created for SIEM transfers that contributed to the problem.

## Solution
- Increased the partition size to accommodate the additional 20GB.
- Implemented a procedure to archive audit logs older than one month to prevent future occurrences.
- Cleared unnecessary files and monitored the disk space usage.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space and log rotation settings to prevent similar issues.
- Ensure that audit logs are configured to rotate properly to avoid excessive disk usage.
- The customer should be advised to periodically review and clear old logs to maintain optimal disk space.
