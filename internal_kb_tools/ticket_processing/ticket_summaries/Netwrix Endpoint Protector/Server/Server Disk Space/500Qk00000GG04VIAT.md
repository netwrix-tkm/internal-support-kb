## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GG04VIAT
- **Case Number:** 422122
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont
- **Contact Name:** Elias LaCount
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Disk Space
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a disk space issue on their hosted EPP server, indicating that log files were not being deleted despite the settings for "Keep backed up logs" and "Keep backed up shadows" being unchecked. The customer was concerned about potential system failure due to low disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Disk Space Alert:** 7% remaining

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the log file backup settings to ensure that both "Keep backed up logs" and "Keep backed up shadows" were unchecked.
2. Checked the AWS instance for any underlying issues.
3. Requested DevOps to reboot the instance.
4. Flaviu requested SSM (AWS Systems Manager) access for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The disk space was occupied by alert emails that were not being sent from the server to the configured SMTP server due to firewall restrictions. This prevented the system from clearing the logs as expected.

## Solution
The disk space issue was resolved by cleaning up the disk space from the backend. The customer was advised to delete the alerts until the SMTP-Firewall configuration could be fixed internally.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that SMTP configurations are correctly set up and that firewall rules allow for email transmission to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regular monitoring of disk space and log file management settings is recommended to avoid potential system failures.
