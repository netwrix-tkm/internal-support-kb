- **Case Number:** 418027
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** HEIN, LEHMANN GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Michael Hartlieb
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with importing a system backup file (v2) after migrating from an Ubuntu 18 server to a new Ubuntu 22 server. The import process failed with the error message "Request Entity Too Large."

## Environment Details
- **Source Server:** Ubuntu 18
- **Target Server:** Ubuntu 22
- **Backup File Size:** 213 MB

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the backup file integrity and size.
2. Attempted to import the backup file multiple times, confirming the import code each time.
3. Checked server logs for any additional error messages related to the import process.
4. Reviewed server configuration settings, particularly those related to file upload limits.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Nginx server configuration, which had a default limit on the maximum allowed size for client request bodies. This limit was set lower than the size of the backup file being imported (213 MB).

## Solution
The issue was resolved by increasing the Nginx memory settings to allow for larger request bodies. This adjustment enabled the successful import of the backup file without encountering the "Request Entity Too Large" error.

## Notes
- Ensure that Nginx configuration settings are reviewed and adjusted appropriately when migrating to a new server, especially if the backup files are large.
- Consider documenting the required Nginx settings for future migrations to prevent similar issues.
