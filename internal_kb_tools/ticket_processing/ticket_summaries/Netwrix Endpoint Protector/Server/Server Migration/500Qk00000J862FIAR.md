- **Case Number:** 428971
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Logiq Consulting
- **Contact Name:** Phil Parkes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** 7.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while migrating data to a new server that was fully updated. The current server was experiencing unexpected reboots after updates. The customer attempted to export only the data using the system backup feature, selecting Database Content and Application Sources. However, the system backup process hung at 99% and did not complete.

## Environment Details
- Current server: Experiencing reboot issues after updates.
- New server: Fully updated and intended for data migration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to perform a system backup using the standard method.
2. Selected options for Database Content and Application Sources.
3. Observed that the backup process hung at 99%.
4. Inquired about alternative methods for data extraction and import.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a problem with the system backup process, specifically with the version being used for the migration. The backup process was not completing successfully, leading to the hang at 99%.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by assisting the customer with the System Backup V2, which provided a more reliable method for data migration. This version addressed the hanging issue and allowed for successful data extraction and import onto the new server.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are using the latest version of the system backup tool for migrations to avoid similar issues.
- Monitor the backup process closely, especially when it approaches completion, to identify any potential hangs early.
- Document any specific configurations or settings used during the backup process for future reference.
