- **Case Number:** 430831
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ACCL @accl.bo
- **Contact Name:** Ricardo Primintela
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, ACCL, required assistance in migrating their server from Ubuntu 14.04 to 18.04 and subsequently to 22.04. The request included support for the entire migration process, with a preference for communication in Spanish.

## Environment Details
- **Old Server OS:** Ubuntu 14.04
- **New Server OS:** Ubuntu 18.04 and then 22.04
- **Service:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a Microsoft Teams meeting with the customer on January 8, 2025, to discuss the upgrade and migration process.
2. Provided the customer with login credentials for the new server.
3. Followed up with the customer to confirm the migration progress from the old EPP server to the new EPP server.
4. Addressed customer requests for additional time to complete the migration.
5. Assisted the customer in using the EPP software removal tool after confirming the conditions of use.
6. Confirmed the completion of the migration and the removal of the old EPP server.

## Root Cause
The need for migration arose from the outdated operating system (Ubuntu 14.04) that required upgrading to maintain compatibility and security. The successful migration was contingent upon the customer's ability to transition users and validate the new server setup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- The customer successfully installing the new EPP appliance.
- Recreating the necessary policies on the new server.
- Confirming the removal of the old EPP appliance after successful migration and validation of the new setup.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need for adequate time to complete migrations, especially when transitioning between major OS versions.
- It is advisable to provide clear instructions and support for using removal tools to avoid any potential issues during the migration process.
- Future migrations should consider language preferences for effective communication, especially for non-English speaking clients.
