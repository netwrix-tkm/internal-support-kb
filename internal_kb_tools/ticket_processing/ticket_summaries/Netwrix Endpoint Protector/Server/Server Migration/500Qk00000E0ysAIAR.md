- **Case Number:** 417037

- **Feature:** Server Migration

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, experienced an issue where the server ID and the number of endpoints were incorrectly migrated from their main server to a test server during a Backup v2 migration. This resulted in the inability to apply the license file for the test server.

## Environment Details
- Main server ID: NMQG4OAA (5000 endpoints)
- Test server ID: BGPR153X (50 endpoints)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified that the server ID and endpoint count were migrated from the main server to the test server.
2. Attempted to apply the license file on the test server, which failed due to the incorrect server ID.
3. Escalated the issue for further investigation.
4. Proposed a command to update the server ID back to its original value.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the unintended migration of the server ID and endpoint count from the main server to the test server during the Backup v2 migration process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing the following SQL command to reset the server ID on the test server:

```sql
UPDATE sysinfo SET value = 'BGPR153X' WHERE name = 'license_ucode';
```

After running this command, the license import on the test server was successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that server IDs and endpoint counts are verified before and after migration processes to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Document any changes made during troubleshooting for future reference and to assist in similar cases.
