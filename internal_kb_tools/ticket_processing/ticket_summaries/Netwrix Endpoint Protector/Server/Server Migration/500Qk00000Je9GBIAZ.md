- **Feature:** Server Migration

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with transferring logs from an old server to a new EPP server and tuning the new server for optimal performance. The new server was set up with a temporary IP address, and the old logs were backed up for over four months.

## Environment Details
- New EPP server configured with a temporary IP address.
- Old logs backed up for more than four months.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Performed MySQL migration to transfer logs from the old server to the new server.
2. Noted that the IP address change was not automatically updated in the configuration.
3. Manually updated the `setup.nginx.conf` file to reflect the new IP address.
4. Conducted optimization of the environment after the configuration changes.

## Root Cause
The issue arose because the IP address change for the new server was not automatically reflected in the configuration files, specifically in the `setup.nginx.conf` file.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually updating the `setup.nginx.conf` file with the new IP address after performing the MySQL migration. Following this, an optimization of the server environment was conducted to ensure proper performance.

## Notes
- Ensure that any IP address changes are manually verified in configuration files during server migrations to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly back up logs and configurations before performing migrations or significant changes to server setups.
