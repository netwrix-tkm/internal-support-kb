## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HjVSVIA3
- **Case Number:** 425727
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stelvio
- **Contact Name:** Jean-Frantz Sume
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Stelvio, requested support to migrate their Endpoint Protector On-Premises service to the AWS Cloud Service. They needed guidance on how to transition effectively while preserving existing configurations, computers, and users.

## Environment Details
- Current setup: Endpoint Protector On-Premises
- Desired setup: AWS Cloud Service
- AWS Account: 091941582492
- Region: ca-central-1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's intention to migrate from on-premises to AWS.
2. Discussed the need to preserve configurations, computers, and users during migration.
3. Provided information on the licensing implications during the migration process.
4. Coordinated with the DevOps team to create and share the Endpoint Protector AMI.
5. Scheduled a remote session to assist with the migration process.

## Root Cause
The need for migration arose from the customer's desire to leverage cloud services for better scalability and management of their Endpoint Protector solution.

## Solution
- The DevOps team successfully created and shared the Endpoint Protector AMI with the customer's AWS account.
- The customer was advised to activate a trial license upon starting the AWS server, ensuring that the backup from the old server would import the licenses correctly.
- A remote session was scheduled to assist the customer in deploying the new appliance and ensuring a smooth transition.

## Notes
- The customer confirmed that their license key would work with both servers during the migration process.
- The smallest AMI available is 100GB, as the operating system and logs require sufficient space.
- The customer was advised to use their Stelvio Certificate issued by DigiCert for the Endpoint Protector, specifically for Single Sign-On access to the console.
- It is important to validate the deployment requirements and ensure that both servers are on the same version before migration.
