- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chevron Phillips Chemical
- **Contact Name:** Jeff Schemp
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after migrating their server configuration to an Azure VM via backup/restore, the server experienced significant performance issues, running very slowly. Additionally, the server would throw errors after changes were made to policies or rights, although redoing the operations would eventually succeed.

## Environment Details
- The server was migrated from an on-premises VM with more CPUs and memory to an Azure VM with fewer resources.
- The customer inquired about the need for optimization specific to Azure VMs and the recommended processor and memory settings for optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the allocated resources on the Azure VM.
2. Attempted to re-optimize the server settings to match the new hardware configuration.
3. Engaged in communication with the customer to gather more details about the performance issues and error messages encountered.

## Root Cause
The performance issues were primarily due to the migration from a server with significantly higher resources (CPUs and memory) to an Azure VM with lower resources. The server settings were not optimized for the new Azure environment, leading to slow performance and errors during policy changes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Checking and adjusting the allocated resources on the Azure VM.
- Re-optimizing the server settings to better align with the available hardware resources in the Azure environment.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that server settings are optimized for the specific environment (Azure VM) after migration.
- Future migrations should consider the resource requirements based on the number of clients and modules activated to avoid performance degradation.
- Recommended processor and memory settings should be reviewed based on the specific workload and usage patterns of the application running on the Azure VM.
