## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N8LusIAF
- **Case Number:** 439450
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** European Space Agency
- **Contact Name:** Gabriele Durantini
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Gabriele Durantini from the European Space Agency, reported issues with their existing Endpoint Protector (EPP) instance, which had crashed. After reinstalling the VM, they were unable to uninstall agents from the machine, even with an Administrator account. The EPP interface did not allow for agent uninstallation, leading to a complete loss of control over the agents.

## Environment Details
- The EPP instance operates completely offline with restricted access.
- The customer was using an older version of EPP prior to the incident.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with a link to download the updated EPP server images.
2. Informed the customer that they could use the same IP address as the old server to ensure communication with existing endpoints.
3. Scheduled a remote session to discuss the issue in detail.
4. Discussed the possibility of creating a new VM and updating the existing server using offline patches.
5. Advised the customer to create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI to retain settings if they were to migrate to a new server version.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure of the existing EPP VM, which resulted in the inability to uninstall agents due to potential corruption or misconfiguration in the EPP interface.

## Solution
The customer successfully migrated to a new EPP server instance (version 5.9.4.0) after uninstalling the remaining agents from the workstations. They were able to handle the installation independently after receiving guidance on the process. The support team confirmed that the customer could reach out for assistance with future updates without needing to redeploy the VM.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the server version is consistent when creating backups and restoring configurations.
- Customers should be advised to check for any existing licenses or files needed for the new installation, as issues with license imports may arise.
- Future updates to the EPP instance should be planned carefully to avoid similar issues with agent control.
