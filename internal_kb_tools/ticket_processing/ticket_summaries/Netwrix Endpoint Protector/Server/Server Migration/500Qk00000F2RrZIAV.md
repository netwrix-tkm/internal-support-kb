## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue related to feedback after a server migration, specifically regarding client upgrades not functioning properly and potential problems with Active Directory (AD) synchronization.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred during a migration from an on-premises server to an AWS-hosted environment.
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Communication:** The support team reached out to the customer to confirm the status of the issue and to schedule a remote session.
2. **Remote Session Scheduling:** Multiple attempts were made to schedule a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. **Log File Review:** The customer was advised to check the client upgrade log files located in `C:\WINDOWS\TEMP` and to review the Event Viewer for any installation-related errors.
4. **AD Sync Instructions:** The customer was provided with steps from the user manual to address the AD synchronization issue.
5. **Firewall and Antivirus Checks:** The customer investigated potential issues with the firewall and Bitdefender antivirus software that could be affecting the client upgrades.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was suggested that the problems could be related to the firewall settings or conflicts with the Bitdefender antivirus software during the client upgrade process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer confirmed that they had successfully installed the missing updates and that the client upgrades were functioning correctly. The support team also confirmed that the System Backup V2 entry was successfully imported on the new server, which facilitated the migration process.

## Notes
- The customer did not respond to follow-up communications for an extended period, leading to the ticket being closed for hygiene purposes.
- It is important to ensure that all necessary updates are installed and that firewall and antivirus settings are configured correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If a customer does not respond for a significant time, consider closing the ticket but ensure to inform them of the closure and provide options for reopening if needed.
