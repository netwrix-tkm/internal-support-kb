## Problem Description
The customer is planning to migrate from an old Ubuntu EPP On-prem Server appliance to a new EPP Server Appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04 on vSphere BUILD 7.0.3.0.1900. They require guidance on hardware requirements to support 500 clients with DC, DLP, DISCOVERY, and ENCRYPTION enabled, and have several questions regarding the migration process.

3. Addressed customer queries regarding:
   - License transfer to the new machine.
   - Communication between the new server and existing clients.
   - Steps for safe and efficient setup.
   - Availability of a virtual device for download and configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's indecision regarding the migration process and the specifications of the new server, compounded by the need for detailed guidance on the migration steps.

## Solution

## Notes
