- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Capital Power Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Chaitanya Jariwala
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on the process to create a new server and migrate settings from an existing server appliance to a Hyper-V environment.

## Environment Details
- The migration involved transitioning from an existing server appliance to a new server running on Hyper-V.
- The customer was using a server appliance based on Ubuntu.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to clarify the requirements for the migration.
2. Discussed the possibility of a call to outline the migration steps or provide a written guide.
3. Provided information regarding the current image available for download, which is based on Ubuntu 22.04.
4. Scheduled a remote assist session to address issues accessing the admin console on the new server.
5. Investigated firewall rules and network settings to ensure proper access to the new server.
6. Provided a script to switch the client connection to the new server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from incorrect IP settings being retained in the client download page, which continued to reference the old server IP instead of the new server IP.

## Solution
- The customer was instructed to verify the network configuration settings on the new server appliance.
- A script was provided to facilitate the transition of client connections to the new server.
- The customer confirmed that the settings on the appliance were configured correctly, and the issue was resolved by ensuring the correct IP was set in the appliance's network configuration.

## Notes
- Ensure that the network configuration settings are updated correctly on the new server to prevent issues with IP retention.
- It is advisable to verify firewall rules and network settings before migration to avoid access issues post-migration.
- Future migrations should include a checklist for verifying network configurations and firewall settings to streamline the process.
