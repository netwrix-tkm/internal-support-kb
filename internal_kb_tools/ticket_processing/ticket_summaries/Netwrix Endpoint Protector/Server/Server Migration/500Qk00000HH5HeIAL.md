- **Case Number:** 424494
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZeMoSo Labs
- **Contact Name:** Chaitanya Anantharapu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** 9.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in migrating their Endpoint Protector (EPP) from an AWS environment to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

## Environment Details
- Current hosting: AWS
- Target hosting: GCP
- Product in use: Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration settings related to log management.
2. Identified the parameter `support_syslogng` in the MySQL database.
3. Changed the value of `support_syslogng` from `0` to `1`.
4. Saved the configuration changes in the user interface (UI).
5. Verified log reception in the SIEM servers post-configuration change.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `support_syslogng` parameter being set to `0`, which prevented logs from being sent to the SIEM servers. Changing this parameter to `1` enabled the log transmission.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the MySQL configuration:
```sql
UPDATE your_table_name SET support_syslogng = 1 WHERE condition;
```
After saving the configuration in the UI, logs began to be received correctly in the SIEM servers, confirming the successful migration process.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `support_syslogng` parameter is correctly configured during future migrations to avoid similar issues.
- Always verify log reception in the SIEM after making configuration changes to confirm that the system is functioning as expected.
