- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FPS Food Process Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Kevin Tung
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after moving the server to a new location and different subnet, and successfully assigning a static IP address in the new subnet, the server was not responding to ping or HTTP/HTTPS requests.

## Environment Details
- The server was migrated to a new physical location.
- The server was assigned a static IP address in a different subnet.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server's new static IP address was correctly assigned.
2. Attempted to ping the server, which did not respond.
3. Checked HTTP and HTTPS connectivity to the server, which also failed.
4. Advised the customer to check the VM configuration for network adapter settings.
5. Suggested ensuring that two bridged network adapters were configured on the VM.
6. Followed up with the customer regarding the status of the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a case of slow downloads and an upgrade process that was not completing, which affected the server's responsiveness.

## Solution
The customer successfully renewed their license and applied it. After applying the license, the customer reported that the issue was resolved. The server regained connectivity, and the customer was able to access the appliance.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that network configurations are correctly set up after a server migration, especially regarding IP addresses and network adapters.
- For future cases, if a server is not responding after a migration, check for network configuration issues, including firewall settings and network adapter configurations.
- If the server experiences slow downloads or hangs during upgrades, consider using the "Offline Patch Uploader" feature to apply updates from another computer.
