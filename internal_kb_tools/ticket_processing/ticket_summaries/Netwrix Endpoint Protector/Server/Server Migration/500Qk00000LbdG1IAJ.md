- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** yourIT GmbH

- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after migrating their server to a new network, the server acquired a new IP address. Consequently, all client machines were unable to locate the server, resulting in all clients being displayed as offline.

## Environment Details
- The server was migrated to a new network, which changed its IP address.
- Clients were unable to communicate with the server due to the IP address change.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the server's new IP address.
2. Checked network connectivity between clients and the server.
3. Investigated client configuration settings to determine if they could be updated with the new IP address.
4. Explored options for notifying clients of the new server IP address.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the server's migration to a new network, which resulted in a change of its IP address. The clients were still attempting to connect to the old IP address, leading to their offline status.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the client configurations to recognize the new IP address of the server. This allowed the clients to re-establish communication with the server.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all clients are updated with the new server IP address following any server migration to prevent communication issues.
- Consider implementing a dynamic DNS solution or similar methods to minimize disruptions during future migrations.
