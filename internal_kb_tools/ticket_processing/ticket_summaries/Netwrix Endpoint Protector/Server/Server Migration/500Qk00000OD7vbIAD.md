- **Case Number:** 442546
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ropes and Gray LLC
- **Contact Name:** Matt Joyce
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Matt Joyce from Ropes and Gray LLC, requested a demonstration of a Netwrix hosted solution, initially believing it to be hosted on Microsoft Azure. The inquiry was related to the potential migration of their current on-premises VM configuration to a hosted solution.

## Environment Details
- The hosted solution is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), not Azure as initially assumed by the customer.
- The customer is currently using an on-premises VM configuration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial email sent to the customer clarifying that the hosted solution is on AWS, not Azure (4/18/2025).
2. Follow-up emails sent to the customer on:
   - 4/18/2025 (initial follow-up)
   - 5/16/2025 (second follow-up)
   - 5/25/2025 (final follow-up)
3. Coordinated with team lead Iosif-Cristian and commercial team member Julia Greene to provide additional information to the customer.
4. Addressed customer inquiries regarding the migration of their current configuration to the AWS-hosted setup.

## Root Cause
The confusion stemmed from the customer's initial request for a demonstration of an Azure-hosted solution, which was incorrect as the Netwrix hosted solution is actually on AWS.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Providing clear communication to the customer regarding the correct hosting platform (AWS).
- Confirming that the support team would assist with the migration of the customer's current on-prem VM configuration to the AWS-hosted management setup.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are clearly informed about the hosting platform (AWS vs. Azure) to avoid confusion in future inquiries.
- Maintain open lines of communication and follow up regularly with customers to keep them informed about their requests and any necessary clarifications.
