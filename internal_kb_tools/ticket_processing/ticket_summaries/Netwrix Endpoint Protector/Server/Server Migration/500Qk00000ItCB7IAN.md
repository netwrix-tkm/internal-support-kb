## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ItCB7IAN
- **Case Number:** 428422
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nexpert AG
- **Contact Name:** Harald Holst
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Nexpert AG, was transitioning from an on-premise architecture to the Azure cloud and required assistance with migrating their Endpoint Protector (EPP) virtual machine to Azure Blob storage.

## Environment Details
- **Customer's Previous Setup:** On-premise architecture
- **Target Setup:** Azure cloud environment

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Contacted the customer, Harald Holst, to discuss the migration process.
2. Scheduled a migration appointment for the EPP VM to Azure Blob.
3. Executed the migration using System Backup V2 from the on-premise server to the Azure-hosted server.
4. Transferred licenses associated with the EPP product to the new environment.
5. Obtained customer approval to close the ticket after successful migration.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to migrate the EPP VM from an on-premise server to Azure Blob as part of the customer's transition to a cloud-based architecture.

## Solution
The migration was successfully completed using System Backup V2, which facilitated the transfer of the EPP VM from the on-premise server to the Azure-hosted server. All necessary licenses were transferred, and the customer confirmed that the migration was successful, allowing for the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- Ensure that all licenses are accounted for and transferred during similar migrations to avoid service interruptions.
- Future migrations should include a follow-up to confirm that all components are functioning correctly post-migration, especially for client connections to the EPP server.
