- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** GESTION DE ACTIVIDADES Y SERVICIOS EMPRESARIALES S.L
- **Contact Name:** DAVID MORENO
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Migration
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in migrating their configuration from a cloud demo of Netwrix Endpoint Protector to a new on-premises installation. The demo access had expired, and they needed to know if the configurations made during the demo could be transferred to the new setup.

## Environment Details
- The customer had previously used a demo version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector with user "Emilio."
- The new installation was to be set up on-premises.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the extension of the demo license to facilitate the migration.
2. Established remote access to the client's server for migration assistance.
3. Assisted the client in setting up their two CAP (Content Aware Protection) rules.
4. Provided guidance on deploying the EPP solution to their groups, suggesting either a third-party deployment tool or Group Policy.
5. Scheduled follow-up communication to ensure the migration was successful and to address any further questions.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the expiration of the demo access, which necessitated the migration of configurations to a new on-premises server. The lack of initial login credentials during the installation process also contributed to the confusion.

## Solution
The migration was successfully completed through a remote session where the support team guided the client in exporting the configuration from the demo server and importing it into the new on-premises installation. The client was also informed about the deployment options for the EPP solution.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that demo licenses are extended if a migration is planned to avoid interruptions.
- Clients should be informed about the necessary credentials and access requirements prior to the migration process.
- Follow-up communication is crucial to confirm the success of the migration and to address any lingering issues.
