## Problem Description
The customer requested information on whether it was possible to migrate their AWS region from Singapore to the Jakarta region in Indonesia.

## Environment Details
- **Customer's Current AWS Region:** Singapore (SG)
- **Requested AWS Region:** Jakarta (ID)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reviewed the customer's request for migration to the Jakarta region.
2. Escalation was initiated to involve the DevOps team for further assistance.
3. DevOps provided guidance that a new hosted machine creation request should be submitted via Salesforce to set up an instance in the Jakarta region.
4. The support team communicated the need for a migration plan from the old instance to the new one.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's initial request for migration, which required a new instance to be created in the Jakarta region, necessitating a formal request through the appropriate channels.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer decided not to proceed with the migration to the Jakarta region. The support team closed the ticket after confirming the change in the customer's decision.

## Notes
- Future requests for AWS region migrations should ensure that a new hosted machine creation request is submitted through Salesforce.
- It is important to communicate clearly with the customer about the implications of migrating to a different region, including potential changes in FQDN and the need for a migration plan.
