## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G2BfhIAF
- **Case Number:** 421643
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Performance
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported an issue where computers appeared as "Licensed" in Device Control even after the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) automatically released the license. The customer requested assistance to clean up these "false licensed" computers.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the previous ticket (00418033) related to similar "false licensed" computers.
2. Confirmed that the EPP had released the licenses as expected.
3. Discussed the possibility of performing a cleanup via a MySQL query to remove the false licensing entries.
4. Arranged a remote session to execute the necessary MySQL commands.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a discrepancy in the licensing status of computers within the Device Control system, likely due to a failure in the synchronization process between the EPP and the Device Control database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing a MySQL query on the server's backend to delete the entries of the "false licensed" computers from the Device Control database. This action successfully updated the licensing status and removed the incorrect entries.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any cleanup operations on the database are performed with caution and ideally during maintenance windows to avoid impacting system performance.
- Future cases involving "false licensed" computers may benefit from reviewing previous tickets for similar resolutions and considering a direct database cleanup as a potential solution.
