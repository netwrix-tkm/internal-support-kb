## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with a server listing over 10,000 network printers and another 10,000 serial port devices that appeared to be duplicates. This was identified as a previously fixed bug during recent migrations. Additionally, the customer faced a separate issue where deleted System Administrators were not re-syncing after deletion.

## Environment Details
- Server ID: GC8AOQGR
- The issue involved duplicate devices in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the duplicate devices further.
2. Removed duplicate devices from the backend.
3. Monitored the server to check if the number of devices would increase again.
4. Discussed the possibility of removing all network printers from Device Control to assess if duplicates would still appear.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a bug that had previously been fixed, which led to the duplication of network printers and serial port devices in the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the duplicate devices from the backend of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. After the removal, the customer was advised to monitor the situation to ensure that duplicates did not reappear.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to keep the ticket open for a week to monitor for any further duplication of devices.
- It is important to verify the distinct serial numbers and user associations of rediscovered printers to ensure they are not mistakenly identified as duplicates.
- Future cases involving device duplication should consider checking for any underlying bugs or issues related to device discovery and synchronization.
