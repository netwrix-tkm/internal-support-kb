## Problem Description
The customer, Loh Services, requested a support session to optimize their Endpoint Protector server settings to accommodate 12,000 endpoints. The session was needed before the scheduled onboarding on July 9, 2024.

## Environment Details
- Customer purchased the Active Data Defence+ bundle.
- The server required optimization to handle a significant increase in endpoint capacity.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a support session with the customer.
2. Communicated with the customer to gather necessary server specifications.
3. Requested the allocation of additional server resources: 
   - 8 CPUs
   - 12 GB RAM
   - 1 TB disk space
4. Planned a remote connection to optimize the server settings.

## Root Cause
The initial server configuration was insufficient to support the increased number of endpoints (12,000) as per the customer's requirements.

## Solution
The support team successfully optimized the Endpoint Protector server by:
- Ensuring the server had the required resources (8 CPUs, 12 GB RAM, and 1 TB disk space) allocated.
- Conducting a remote session to adjust the server settings accordingly.

## Notes
- Ensure that server specifications are reviewed and confirmed before onboarding sessions for new customers to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to allocate additional resources proactively when expecting a significant increase in endpoint management.
