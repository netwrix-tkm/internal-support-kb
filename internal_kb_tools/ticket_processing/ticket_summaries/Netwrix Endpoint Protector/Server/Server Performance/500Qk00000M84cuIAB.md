## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M84cuIAB
- **Case Number:** 436527
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DataVisor
- **Contact Name:** Ismail Reyhanoglu
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Performance
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the denylist feature in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was not enforcing properly. This issue arose after deploying the agent from their Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, Hexnode. The denylist had previously worked but stopped functioning, prompting the customer to delete and reinstall the agent.

## Environment Details
- Denylist not working
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) enabled
- No allowlisted items present

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue with the customer and gathered initial details.
2. Conducted a remote session to replicate the issue and generate logs.
3. Analyzed logs and identified that the network extension was not installed properly.
4. Recommended removing the EPP agent and reinstalling it manually.
5. Ensured that the necessary settings/configurations for allowing network extensions were in place for MDM deployment.
6. Suggested re-deploying the DPI certificate and ensuring it was trusted in Keychain Access.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the improper installation of the EPP's network extension, which was likely not allowed on the machine due to MDM settings or restrictions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Manually reinstalling the EPP agent, which allowed the denylist to function correctly.
- Ensuring that the network extension was properly installed and allowed on the machine.
- Verifying that the DPI certificate was correctly deployed and trusted.

## Notes
- Ensure that the network extension is allowed on devices managed by MDM before deploying the EPP agent.
- If issues persist after manual installation, further investigation into MDM settings may be required.
- The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved and the ticket could be closed.
