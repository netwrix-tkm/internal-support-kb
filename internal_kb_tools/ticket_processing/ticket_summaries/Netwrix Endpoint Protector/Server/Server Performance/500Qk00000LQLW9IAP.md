## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving AWS alerts regarding high memory usage on their EPP server, which occasionally reached 90%.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server Version: 5700 (upgraded to 5941)
- AWS environment

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Upgraded the EPP server from version 5700 to 5941 (latest version).
2. Rebooted the EPP server.
3. Cleared space in the backend.
4. Configured Audit Log Backups to backup and remove logs older than 1 month, addressing a backlog of approximately 1.5 million logs.

## Root Cause
The high memory usage was primarily caused by an excessive number of logs (1.5 million) that were not being managed properly, which likely led to performance issues. Additionally, potential misconfigurations in policies and file shadows were considered as contributing factors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing the following actions:
- Upgrading the EPP server to the latest version (5941).
- Rebooting the server to apply changes.
- Clearing backend space to improve performance.
- Setting up a log management strategy to automatically backup and delete old logs, thus reducing the load on the server.

## Notes
- It is recommended that the customer upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version when possible. The latest version can be downloaded from System Configuration -> Client Software.
- Future monitoring of memory usage is advised to ensure that the changes implemented continue to maintain optimal performance.
