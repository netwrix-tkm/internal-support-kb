## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with starting the Nginx service on a newly created VM in Proxmox. They were unable to access the command line interface (CLI) or connect to the server via SSH after enabling SSH access.

## Environment Details
- Virtualization Platform: Proxmox
- Server Type: VM with unspecified server version
- Services Involved: Nginx web server and reverse proxy

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer created a VM on Proxmox and configured the network settings via the GUI.
2. SSH was enabled, but the customer could not access the CLI or connect over SSH.
3. Support suggested checking for missing network adapters in the VM configuration.
4. Customer was informed about the need to whitelist the EPP in SentinelOne antivirus due to compatibility issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a missing network adapter in the VM configuration, which prevented proper network connectivity and access to the CLI.

## Solution
The customer added the missing network adapter to the VM configuration as suggested. This resolved the issue, allowing access to the CLI and enabling the Nginx service to start successfully. Additionally, the customer was advised to whitelist the EPP in SentinelOne antivirus to address a separate issue related to EPP UI access.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary network adapters are configured when setting up VMs in Proxmox to avoid connectivity issues.
- For environments using SentinelOne, always verify that EPP components are whitelisted to prevent compatibility issues.
