## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EP9HlIAL
- **Case Number:** 418038
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Brabners Chaffe Street
- **Contact Name:** John Grifiths
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** Server Performance
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading from version 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0, the server performance significantly degraded, resulting in slow response times and page timeouts.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Upgraded Version:** 5.9.4.0
- **Build Number:** 5940

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the upgrade process to ensure it was completed without errors.
2. Assessed server resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify any bottlenecks.
3. Checked for any known issues or patches related to version 5.9.4.0.
4. Reviewed server logs for any error messages or warnings that could indicate performance issues.
5. Conducted performance tests to replicate the slow response times.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the performance issues was identified as insufficient optimization of the appliance resources following the upgrade. The new version may have increased resource demands that were not met by the existing configuration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by optimizing the appliance resources. This involved adjusting the server settings to better allocate CPU and memory resources, ensuring that the server could handle the increased load from the upgraded version.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor server performance closely after any upgrades to identify potential issues early.
- Consider performing resource optimization as a standard procedure following major upgrades to prevent similar issues in the future.
