## Problem Description
The customer reported extreme slowness on all Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) instances (both Windows 10 and Windows 11) after enabling the "Advanced Printing" and "MTP Scanning" settings in a specific group. The issue was resolved after disabling these settings.

## Environment Details
- The issue affected VDIs running on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.
- The environment utilizes Citrix services.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to check all Citrix services running on a terminal.
2. Created an MTP scanning exception application list.
3. Advised the customer to raise an internal change request to enable the settings again for further testing.
4. Proposed a meeting to gather logs once the settings were re-enabled.

## Root Cause
The slowness experienced on the VDIs was directly linked to the activation of the "Advanced Printing" and "MTP Scanning" settings. These settings likely caused performance degradation across the VDI environment.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the "Advanced Printing" and "MTP Scanning" settings. Additionally, adding specific items to the scanning exception list helped mitigate the performance issues when the settings were re-evaluated.

## Notes
- It is crucial for the customer to raise an internal change request before re-enabling the settings to allow for proper monitoring and logging.
- Future implementations of similar settings should include a thorough assessment of potential impacts on VDI performance to prevent similar issues.
