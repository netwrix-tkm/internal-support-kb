## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the CAP Policy "Print CAN SIN Windows," where the policy was triggered by an internal OMF Excel file that did not contain any keywords related to "CAN SIN." The customer requested assistance in identifying the cause of this unexpected behavior.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while using a large Excel file for data processing.
- Log files were provided from a user's computer for analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the log files attached by the customer.
2. Confirmed that the policy was triggered despite the absence of relevant keywords in the Excel file.
3. Investigated the contextual detection dictionary used by the policy.
4. Removed the term "SIN" from the contextual detection dictionary to test if it affected the triggering of the policy.

## Root Cause
The unexpected triggering of the policy was caused by a term in the contextual detection dictionary. Specifically, the presence of the term "SIN" in the dictionary led to the policy being triggered, even when the actual content of the file did not contain any relevant keywords.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing the term "SIN" from the contextual detection dictionary. After this adjustment, the policy no longer triggered on files that did not contain any relevant keywords, confirming that the dictionary item was the cause of the unexpected behavior.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the contextual detection dictionary regularly to ensure that it does not contain terms that could lead to false positives.
- Future cases involving unexpected policy triggers should include a review of the contextual detection dictionary as a potential troubleshooting step.
