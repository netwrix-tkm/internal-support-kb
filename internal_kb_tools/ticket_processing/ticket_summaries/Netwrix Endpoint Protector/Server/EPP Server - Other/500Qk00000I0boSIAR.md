## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I0boSIAR
- **Case Number:** 426394
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SEH America
- **Contact Name:** Frank Donahe
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, SEH America, was splitting their network into two segments and needed to clone their existing server. They were informed that a new server ID would be required after cloning.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to clone the server.
2. A script was run to remove the old server ID and other related information.
3. The server was reconnected to the live update service.
4. A new server ID was obtained after the cleanup process.

## Root Cause
The issue arose because the cloned server retained the old server ID, which is not permissible when splitting the network. The requirement for a new server ID was necessary to ensure proper functionality and compliance with the network segmentation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing a cleanup script that removed the old server ID and other associated data. After this, the server was successfully reconnected to the live update service, allowing for the generation of a new server ID.

## Notes
- Ensure that any cloned servers have their old IDs removed before reconnecting to live services to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document the cleanup script used for future reference or similar cases.
