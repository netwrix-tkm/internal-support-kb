- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer needed to move all of their seats to a new server but lacked a current ISO for the EPP environment and access to the old system, which was no longer in use.

## Environment Details
- The customer had 300 endpoints divided between two servers and required them to be consolidated onto a single new server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's requirement for a new license file that includes all 300 endpoints.
2. Provided the customer with download links for the EPP Server image.
3. Supplied the requested license file to facilitate the setup on the new server.

## Root Cause
The issue arose due to the customer not having access to the old system and lacking a current installation ISO for the EPP environment, which was necessary for setting up the new server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with:
- Download links for the EPP Server image, allowing them to obtain the necessary installation media.
- A new license file that included all 300 endpoints, enabling the consolidation of endpoints onto the new server.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers maintain access to installation media and license files when transitioning to new systems to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to remind customers to back up their license files and installation ISOs regularly.
