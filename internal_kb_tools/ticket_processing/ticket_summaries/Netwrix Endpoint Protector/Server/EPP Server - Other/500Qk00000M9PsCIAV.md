## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M9PsCIAV
- **Case Number:** 436603
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 17.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the API filters not functioning as expected. Specifically, they encountered errors when attempting to filter events by `event_id`, `device_type`, and received incorrect results when filtering by `event_name` and `vid/pid`.

## Environment Details
- **API Version:** Not specified, but related to Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- **Filtering Parameters:** Various parameters including `event_id`, `event_name`, `device_type`, `vid`, and `pid`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the API requests made by the customer, including:
   - `&filter_by[event_id]=20` - resulted in a 400 Bad Request error.
   - `&filter_by[event_name]=Blocked` - returned events including `Unblocked`.
   - `&filter_by[device_type]=Webcam` - resulted in a 400 Bad Request error.
   - `&filter_by[vid]=0&filter_by[pid]=0` - returned items where `vid` and `pid` were not 0.
2. Raised a ticket to QA for further investigation and clarification.
3. Provided an explanation to the customer regarding the filtering mechanism.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misunderstanding of how the API handles filtering parameters. Certain parameters accept multiple selections, which require specific formatting in the API request.

## Solution
The solution involved clarifying the correct usage of the API filters:
- For parameters that accept multiple selections, the correct format is to use square brackets `[]` after the parameter name. For example:
  ```plaintext
  /api/logs/device-control?limit=10&page=1&direction=DESC&filter_by[device_type_id][]=1
  ```
- The correct parameter for filtering by device type is `device_type_id`, not `device_type`.
- The parameters that accept multiple selections include:
  - `event_id`
  - `machine_name`
  - `device_name`
  - `client_name`
  - `device_type_id`
  
The customer confirmed that with the provided information, some filters worked, and they were able to export the required information via the API.

## Notes
- Ensure that API documentation is updated to reflect the correct usage of filtering parameters, especially the need for square brackets for parameters that support multiple selections.
- Future inquiries regarding API filters should include a review of the parameter formatting to prevent similar misunderstandings.
