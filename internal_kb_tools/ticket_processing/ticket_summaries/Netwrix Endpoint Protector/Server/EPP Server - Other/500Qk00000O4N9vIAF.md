## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in setting up an on-premise server for Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) in a Proxmox virtualized environment. They were unable to find installation instructions specific to Proxmox and needed help to connect to the EPP UI console.

## Environment Details
- Virtualization Platform: Proxmox
- Product: Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer.
2. Joined the remote session and assisted the customer in configuring the virtual machine (VM).
3. Identified that the customer could not connect to the EPP UI console.
4. Accessed the backend and discovered that the second NIC (Network Interface Card) was not configured.
5. Guided the customer to configure the virtual hardware in Proxmox to include the second NIC.
6. Completed the network configuration from the VM UI.
7. Verified that the customer could now log into the EPP UI without issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the absence of a second NIC configuration in the virtual machine, which was necessary for proper network connectivity to the EPP UI.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by assisting the customer in configuring the second NIC on the VM within Proxmox. After completing the network configuration, the customer was able to access the EPP UI via a web browser.

## Notes
- The customer inquired about adding Linux users to the EPP system, which may require additional guidance.
- Ensure that future customers are aware of the need to configure multiple NICs for network connectivity in virtualized environments, especially when using Proxmox.
