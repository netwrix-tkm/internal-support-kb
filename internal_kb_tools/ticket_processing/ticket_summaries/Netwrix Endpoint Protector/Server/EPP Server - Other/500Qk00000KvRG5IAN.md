## Problem Description
A client reported that they had forgotten their credentials and were unable to log in using the root account. They requested a password reset to regain access.

## Environment Details
- The client has only one admin account in the `sf_guard_user` table and no root account available.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Received the request for a password reset from the client.
2. Verified the absence of a root account in the `sf_guard_user` table.
3. Obtained approval from the DevOps team to proceed with the password reset.
4. Connected to the backend system to perform the password reset.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the client forgetting their credentials, compounded by the fact that there was no root account available for recovery.

## Solution
The password was successfully reset after receiving the necessary approval from the DevOps team. The technician connected to the backend and executed the password reset process.

## Notes
- Ensure that clients are aware of the importance of maintaining access to admin accounts to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a recovery process or additional admin accounts to avoid reliance on a single account for access.
