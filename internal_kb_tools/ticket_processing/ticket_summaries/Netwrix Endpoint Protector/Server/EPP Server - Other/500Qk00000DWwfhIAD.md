- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to delete system departments created for testing purposes. Upon attempting to delete a department, an error message was displayed indicating that the selected department could not be deleted due to associated items.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the department had no associated items.
2. Attempted to delete the department multiple times, receiving the same error message each time.
3. Reviewed the configuration of the system departments to identify any hidden associations.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the presence of linked groups associated with the departments, which prevented their deletion. Although the customer believed there were no associated items, the linked groups were not initially considered.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by de-linking the groups that were attached to the departments. Once the groups were removed, the departments could be deleted without any errors.

## Notes
- Ensure to check for any linked groups or associations when encountering similar deletion issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to provide guidance on how to identify and manage linked items within the system to prevent similar issues.
