- **Case Number:** 433404
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NBC Universal
- **Contact Name:** Easton Lindauer
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5940 to 5941

## Problem Description
The customer, Easton Lindauer from NBC Universal, inquired about the licensing implications of migrating data from an old Endpoint Protector server to a new one. They were concerned about the need to run both servers simultaneously during the migration and whether their current licensing would support this scenario.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 5940
- **Target Version:** 5941
- **Migration Type:** Server migration with user/group data transfer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set up the new Endpoint Protector (EPP) server.
2. Activated a Trial license via System Configuration -> System Licensing -> Trial (30 days).
3. Imported the System Backup v2 to the new EPP server.
4. Upgraded the EPP server from version 5940 to 5941.
5. Swapped the IP address from the old EPP server to the new one to ensure EPP clients connect to the new server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity regarding the licensing requirements for running two Endpoint Protector servers simultaneously during the migration process. The customer needed to ensure compliance with licensing terms while performing the migration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Setting up a Trial license for the new server, allowing the customer to run both servers during the migration period without violating licensing agreements.
- Successfully migrating the user/group data and upgrading the server version.

## Notes
- It is advisable for customers planning server migrations to confirm licensing requirements in advance to avoid potential compliance issues.
- Temporary licenses, such as trial licenses, can be utilized effectively during migration processes to facilitate smooth transitions.
