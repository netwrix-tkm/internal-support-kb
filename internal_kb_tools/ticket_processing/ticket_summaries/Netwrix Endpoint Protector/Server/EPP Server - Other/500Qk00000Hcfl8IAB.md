- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chemline
- **Contact Name:** Javaign Vinson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Password Reset
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to reset their password for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, preventing access to the system.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested SSH access to the system.
2. The password was reset to a default value as per the customer's request.
3. The customer was informed of the new password and instructed to log in.
4. Follow-up communications were made to confirm if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case notes. However, it is possible that the customer was using an incorrect password or that there was a misconfiguration preventing the password reset.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the password to a default value (`epp2011`). The customer confirmed that they were able to log in successfully after the reset.

## Notes
- It is advisable to check if Active Directory (AD) Sync or similar features are enabled, as these could overwrite the password and cause repeated lockouts.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the default password and the necessity to change it upon first login for security reasons.
