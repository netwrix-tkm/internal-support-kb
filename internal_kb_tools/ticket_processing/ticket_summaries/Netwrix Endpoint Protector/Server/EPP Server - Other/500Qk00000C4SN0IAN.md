## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C4SN0IAN
- **Case Number:** 412455
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International
- **Contact Name:** Denis Pasca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested a method to generate a report or view of users with custom settings that differ from the global settings they should inherit. They also reported a bug where enabling debug logging caused the "Intercept VPN Traffic" option to turn off.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the issue regarding the "Intercept VPN Traffic" setting being affected by enabling debug logging.
2. Suggested generating an "Effective Rights" report to identify users with custom settings.
3. Provided instructions on how to navigate to "Dashboard" > "Effective Rights" to generate the report.
4. Clarified that the report generated would only show user rights, not specific user settings.
5. Suggested creating a "Settings Report" under "Device Control" > "Computers" to view settings applied at the computer level.

## Root Cause
The issue with the "Intercept VPN Traffic" setting being turned off when debug logging is enabled was confirmed to be reproducible in the support engineer's environment, indicating a potential bug in the software.

## Solution
The customer was advised to generate an "Effective Rights" report to identify users with custom settings. However, it was clarified that the report only provides user rights and not specific user settings. For settings at the computer level, a "Settings Report" could be generated instead.

## Notes
- The current functionality only allows for settings reports to be generated at the computer level, not the user level.
- It is important to keep track of any bugs related to the debug logging feature and report them to the development team for further investigation.
