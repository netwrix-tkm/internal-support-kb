## Problem Description
The customer enabled Smart Groups in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) and created a Smart Group with a dynamic rule for a group of computers. They whitelisted a device against this Smart Group and inquired about how to view which computers are assigned to the Smart Group.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was informed that all computers matching the naming convention set in the Smart Group would be included.
2. The customer was advised to check the effective rights for the computers by navigating to the Dashboard -> Effective Rights and generating a report for one of the computers that matches the naming convention of the Smart Group.
3. A follow-up was suggested to schedule a Zoom meeting for further discussion if needed.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a technical malfunction but rather a lack of understanding of how Smart Groups function within the EPP system.

## Solution
The customer's question was answered by explaining how Smart Groups work, specifically that computers are included based on the naming convention set in the Smart Group. The customer was guided on how to verify the rights for the computers in the Smart Group through the EPP Dashboard.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand the naming conventions and how they affect the inclusion of computers in Smart Groups.
- Future inquiries regarding Smart Groups should include a reminder to check the effective rights and naming conventions to ensure proper configuration.
