- **Account/Company:** Nixon Peabody LLP
- **Contact Name:** Paul Goyette
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 1.0

## Problem Description
The customer needed to apply a new license key to their Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) server and inquired whether this process would require a server restart and if it would interrupt endpoint protection for clients.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the process for applying a new license key in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
2. Confirmed whether a server restart is necessary when applying the license key.
3. Assessed the potential impact on endpoint protection during the license key application.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity regarding the license key application process and its implications on server operations and client endpoint protection.

## Solution
The support technician provided the customer with the necessary information regarding the license key application process. It was confirmed that applying the new license key did not require a server restart and that endpoint protection for clients would not be interrupted. The import of the license key was successfully completed without any issues.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly to customers that applying a new license key typically does not require a server restart and does not interrupt endpoint protection services.
- Future inquiries regarding license key applications should include confirmation of the process and its implications to avoid confusion.
