- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P3TAMIA3
- **Case Number:** 444749
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Pestalozzi Rechtsanw√§lte AG
- **Contact Name:** IT Support
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 7.2

## Problem Description
The customer was unable to set up external storage on their EPP installation, receiving an error message indicating that it could not connect to the designated share. Despite confirming that the share settings were correct and functional from other devices, the EPP Server did not establish any connections to the share.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Installation:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Network Configuration:** The EPP Server successfully connected to Active Directory and the Mailserver but failed to connect to the file share.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message received during the external storage setup.
2. Checked firewall logs, confirming that the EPP Server was not attempting any connections to the file share.
3. Verified share settings using other devices on the network to ensure they were correct.
4. Attempted to connect to the shared drive via SSH and performed a ping test, which was successful.
5. Investigated the configuration settings on the EPP Server for potential misconfigurations.
6. Conducted a remote session with the client to further diagnose the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the external storage settings, specifically an incorrect username used by the client during the setup process.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by correcting the username in the external storage settings. After making this change, the connection to the file share was successfully established, and the necessary folders for backups were generated in the shared drive.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct username and permissions are configured when setting up external storage to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to verify connectivity and settings through multiple methods (e.g., SSH, ping tests) to diagnose connection issues effectively.
