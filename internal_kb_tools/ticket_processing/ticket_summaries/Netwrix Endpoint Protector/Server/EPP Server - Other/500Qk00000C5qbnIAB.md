## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C5qbnIAB
- **Case Number:** 412509
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Quad Graphics
- **Contact Name:** Jacob Edwards
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 11.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that all users were receiving an "invalid username or password" error when attempting to log in to the Endpoint Protector (EPP) console, despite verifying the user credentials multiple times.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted on-premises.
- The customer is located in the US Central time zone.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified user credentials multiple times.
2. Engaged the Identity team to check logs for any authentication issues, but no obvious problems were found.
3. Scheduled a remote session for further investigation.
4. During the remote session, confirmed that the user and password were correct for Active Directory (AD) authentication.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a problem with the Active Directory (AD) synchronization settings, which required reconfiguration.

## Solution
The resolution involved recreating the AD synchronization settings within the EPP console. After this was completed, users were able to log in successfully without encountering the invalid username or password error.

## Notes
- Ensure that AD synchronization settings are correctly configured to avoid similar login issues in the future.
- If transitioning to LDAPS for AD sync, verify compatibility and configuration requirements in advance to prevent disruptions.
