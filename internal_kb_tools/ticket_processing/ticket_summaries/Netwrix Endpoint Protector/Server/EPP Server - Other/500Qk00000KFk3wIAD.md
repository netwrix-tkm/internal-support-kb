## Problem Description
The customer reported that they could no longer access the Endpoint Protector Portal due to the departure of an employee who had the credentials for the "root" user account. They requested assistance in resetting the password for the root user or guidance on how to do it themselves.

## Environment Details
- **Portal URL:** [4ehl15d.hosted.endpointprotector.com](https://4ehl15d.hosted.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the request for password reset for the root user account.
2. Confirmed the identity of the requestor and the legitimacy of the request.
3. Initiated the password reset process for the root user account.

## Root Cause
The inability to access the Endpoint Protector Portal was due to the departure of an employee who held the credentials for the root user account, resulting in a lack of access for the remaining team members.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a password reset for the root user account. The new credentials were provided to the customer, allowing them to regain access to the Endpoint Protector Portal.

## Notes
- Ensure that access credentials for critical accounts like "root" are documented and shared among team members to prevent similar access issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a policy for regular credential updates and sharing to maintain access continuity.
