- **Case Number:** 425874
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ServiceNow
- **Contact Name:** Arpitha Shetty
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to export reports from the Device Control section, specifically from the "Computers" tab. They could not find any reports available for download under "System Maintenance > Exported Entities."

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.
- The issue persisted even after the customer updated the EPP Server to the latest version.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer was checking the correct tabs in "System Maintenance > Exported Entities" for the exported reports.
2. Advised the customer to check both the "Settings exports" and "List of exports" tabs.
3. Engineering indicated that the issue was fixed in version 5.9.4.1, but the customer could not update to this version initially.
4. The customer attempted to manually apply the fix from version 5.9.4.0.
5. Engaged R&D for further assistance after the issue persisted post-update.
6. Suggested removing any incomplete exports that may be causing conflicts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incomplete exports that were not finalized, which prevented new exports from being generated and displayed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the exports that were not completed. This action cleared the backlog of incomplete exports, allowing the system to generate new exports successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for any incomplete exports in the future, as they can block new export requests.
- Ensure that the server has sufficient disk space and that any scheduled exports are managed properly to avoid similar issues.
- If the issue persists after an upgrade, check for any residual incomplete exports and consider manual cleanup as a first step.
