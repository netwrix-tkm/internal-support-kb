- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with renewing the SSL certificate for their EPP server, using the same Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from the previous year. They needed guidance on the steps to complete the renewal process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Server Type:** EPP Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Contact:** The customer reached out for instructions on renewing the SSL certificate.
2. **Response Provided:** The support engineer confirmed that a colleague would assist due to time zone differences.
3. **Guidance on Certificate Installation:** The support engineer instructed the customer to add the SSL certificate via "Appliance > Server Maintenance" and to ensure they had the certificate body and the key.
4. **Customer Follow-Up:** The customer attempted to renew the certificate but encountered an "Invalid Server Certificate" error.
5. **Further Clarification:** The support engineer advised the customer to include the intermediate certificate in the body and confirmed that the key should be in the `.key` file.
6. **Remote Assistance Offered:** The support engineer proposed a remote session to assist with the installation.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer not correctly appending the intermediate certificate and the key in the required format, leading to the "Invalid Server Certificate" error during the renewal process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the customer included both the intermediate certificate and the private key in the correct format when attempting to renew the SSL certificate. The support engineer provided clear instructions on how to structure the certificate body and key, which allowed the customer to successfully apply the certificate.

## Notes
- Ensure that the intermediate certificate is included in the body when renewing SSL certificates.
- Verify that the private key is correctly referenced in the `.key` file.
- For future cases, consider offering remote assistance if the customer continues to face issues after initial guidance.
