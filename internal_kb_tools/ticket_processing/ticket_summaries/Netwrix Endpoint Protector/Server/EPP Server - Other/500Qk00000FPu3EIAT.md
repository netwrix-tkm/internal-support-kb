## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FPu3EIAT
- **Case Number:** 420284
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International
- **Contact Name:** Denis Pasca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite setting the EPP Client Mode to "Hidden icon" in the Global Settings, the EPP Client icon still appeared in the system tray after a restart on both Windows and Mac systems. They requested assistance in removing the icon from displaying to users.

## Environment Details
- **Platforms:** Windows and Mac
- **EPP Client Configuration:** Set to "Hidden icon" in Global Settings

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the EPP Client Mode setting in Global Settings.
2. Restarted the systems to check if the icon visibility changed.
3. Investigated user permissions and rights on the affected computers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by custom rights assigned to specific computers, which prevented the EPP Client from being properly configured to hide the icon.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the custom rights for the affected computers. Once the rights were modified, the EPP Client icon no longer appeared in the system tray after a restart, successfully implementing the "Hidden icon" setting.

## Notes
- Ensure that custom rights are reviewed when configuring settings for the EPP Client, as they can impact the visibility of the client icon.
- Future configurations should be tested on a representative sample of systems to confirm that settings apply as expected across different user rights.
