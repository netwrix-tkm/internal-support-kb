- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the server time was incorrect, being 2 hours behind the correct time. This issue arose suddenly after functioning correctly until the previous week.

## Environment Details
- The server was configured to use an NTP server that provided time data which was 1 hour behind the actual time.
- The customer noted that Turkey does not observe daylight saving time, which may have contributed to the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered necessary details from the customer regarding the time discrepancy.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. Connected to the server via SSH during the remote session.
4. Attempted to adjust the server's timezone settings.
5. Configured the server timezone to Moscow as a temporary measure.
6. Consulted with the R&D team for further guidance on resolving the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the NTP server providing incorrect time data, which was compounded by the lack of daylight saving time adjustments in Turkey.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Reconfiguring the server's timezone settings to ensure they were correctly set to Istanbul.
- Ensuring that the system clock was synchronized with a reliable NTP server.
- Following specific commands provided by the R&D team to set the timezone and synchronize the clock:
  ```bash
  sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Istanbul
  sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
  sudo hwclock --systohc --utc
  ```

## Notes
- It is important to verify the NTP server being used to ensure it provides accurate time data.
- Future configurations should take into account local timezone practices, especially regarding daylight saving time.
- Regular checks on server time synchronization can prevent similar issues from arising.
