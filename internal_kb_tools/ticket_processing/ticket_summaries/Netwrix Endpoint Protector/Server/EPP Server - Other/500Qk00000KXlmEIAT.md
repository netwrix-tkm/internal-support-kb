## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to download logs from the Logs Report after collecting diagnostics from a computer. Although 'Artifact Received' events were visible, clicking the down arrow in the Actions column did not initiate any download.

## Environment Details
- Multiple browsers were tested on various computers, indicating that the issue was not isolated to a single browser or machine.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected diagnostics from the affected computer.
2. Verified the presence of 'Artifact Received' events in the Logs Report.
3. Attempted to download logs using different web browsers on multiple computers.
4. Confirmed that no download action occurred upon clicking the down arrow in the Actions column.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. The problem persisted across different browsers and computers, suggesting a potential issue with the application or server configuration rather than a client-side problem.

## Solution
The ticket was closed at the customer's request without a definitive resolution to the download issue. It is recommended to monitor for similar cases and gather more information if the issue reoccurs.

## Notes
- Future cases involving download issues from the Logs Report should consider checking server configurations and application logs for errors.
- It may be beneficial to gather more detailed information from the customer regarding their environment and any specific configurations that could affect log downloads.
