- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server was not functioning correctly, preventing MacOS clients from communicating policies and resulting in an inaccurate dashboard.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the server side of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The server version in use was 5.9.4.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the MacOS clients were unable to communicate with the server.
2. Checked the configuration file located at `/var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml` for corruption.
3. Verified that no custom certificates were being used.
4. Checked if "Increased Communication Security" was enabled and attempted to disable it.
5. Regenerated the server certificate stack to restore communication.
6. The server's last seen status was monitored, and screenshots were provided to support the investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as an issue on the server side that hindered communication between the EPP server and MacOS clients. The specific details of the underlying issue were not disclosed, but it was resolved by setting up a new server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by spinning up a new Endpoint Protector server. After this action, the customer confirmed that the problem no longer reproduced, and the MacOS clients were able to communicate policies correctly.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor server performance and client communication regularly to preemptively identify similar issues.
- Ensure that configuration files are backed up before making changes to avoid potential corruption.
- If issues arise again, consider setting up a new server as a potential solution based on this case's resolution.
