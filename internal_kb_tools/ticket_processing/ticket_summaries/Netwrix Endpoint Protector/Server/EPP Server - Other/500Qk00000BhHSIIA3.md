## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to change the root password after logging in, as the old password was not being accepted.

## Environment Details
- The server UI was noted to be in German.
- The customer was using a root account or another EPP admin account with 'super admin' rights.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician advised the customer to ensure they were logged in using the root account or another EPP admin account with 'super admin' rights.
2. The customer was instructed that the old password was not needed to change the password; only the new password needed to be entered twice for confirmation.
3. A remote session was proposed to reset the root admin's password to the default value from the backend of the appliance.
4. The root password was reset from the backend by the support technician.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer not being able to authenticate with the old password, which may have been due to an incorrect password entry or a potential issue with the password management system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the root admin's password to the default value from the backend. After this reset, the customer was able to successfully change the password from the server UI.

## Notes
- The customer followed up after the resolution but did not provide further responses, indicating that the issue was likely resolved satisfactorily.
- It is important to ensure that the customer is aware of the need to use a completely new password that has not been used previously when changing passwords in the future.
