- **Case Number:** 431294
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Salvation Army
- **Contact Name:** Martin Jebb
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with running the Web Interface after onboarding several thousand Windows devices.

## Environment Details
- Previous EPP Server Appliance: Ubuntu 14
- New EPP Server Appliance: Ubuntu 22
- Number of endpoints: Approximately 3000

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to assess the performance issues.
2. Migrated the customer from the older EPP Server Appliance (Ubuntu 14) to the latest EPP Server Appliance (Ubuntu 22).
3. Optimized the new EPP Server appliance with the following specifications:
   - 12 CPU cores
   - 16 GB RAM
   - 3 TB HDD storage

## Root Cause
The performance issues were primarily due to insufficient server resources to handle the load from several thousand endpoints on the older server configuration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by migrating to a new EPP Server Appliance running Ubuntu 22 and optimizing it with adequate resources (12 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, and 3 TB HDD storage) to support the 3000 endpoints effectively.

## Notes
- Ensure that server specifications are adequate for the number of endpoints being managed to prevent similar performance issues in the future.
- Regularly review and optimize server resources as the number of endpoints increases.
