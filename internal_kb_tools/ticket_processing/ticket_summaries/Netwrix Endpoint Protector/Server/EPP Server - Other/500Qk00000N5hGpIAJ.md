- **Case Number:** 439276
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The Government of Mongolia is considering changing the time zone to implement daylight saving time. The customer inquired about how to configure their EPP server to align with the potential time zone change and whether they would need to handle this change themselves or if it would be managed by Netwrix.

## Environment Details
- Current time zone: UTC+8
- NTP Server configuration is managed under "Appliance" > "Server Maintenance".

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's inquiry regarding the potential time zone change and its implications for the EPP server.
2. Confirmed that the times are automatically updated and synchronized with the selected NTP Server.
3. Provided information on how the NTP server would handle daylight saving time changes automatically.

## Root Cause
The inquiry was prompted by the potential change in the time zone by the Government of Mongolia, which could affect the server's time settings. However, the system is designed to automatically synchronize with the NTP server, mitigating the need for manual adjustments.

## Solution
The customer was informed that:
- The EPP server's time settings are automatically updated and synchronized with the NTP Server configured in the system.
- If daylight saving time is implemented, the NTP server will automatically adjust to provide the correct time without requiring any manual intervention from the customer.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to ensure that the correct NTP server is configured in their system settings to facilitate automatic time updates.
- Customers should be aware that any changes in local time regulations (like daylight saving time) will be handled automatically by the NTP server, reducing the need for manual adjustments.
