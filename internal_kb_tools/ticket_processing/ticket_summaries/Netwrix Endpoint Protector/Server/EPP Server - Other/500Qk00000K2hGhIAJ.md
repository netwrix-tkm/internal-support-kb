## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K2hGhIAJ
- **Case Number:** 430904
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Comerica Bank
- **Contact Name:** Maria De La Garza
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The root partition of Comerica's QA and PROD appliances was consistently 65-70% full, prompting concerns about disk space management and potential performance impacts.

## Environment Details
- Appliances running on Ubuntu 18 with a root partition size of 20 GB.
- The issue was observed in both QA and PROD environments.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the management console for disk space alerts.
2. Identified that the root partition's capacity was primarily affected by PHP and system logs.
3. Confirmed that an automated job exists to clean up logs but may not have executed as expected.
4. Discussed potential manual cleanup options, pending change control approval from Comerica.
5. Proposed an upgrade to Ubuntu 22 to increase root partition size to 50 GB, but recommended waiting until a scheduled upgrade in February/March.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the disk space issue was identified as the accumulation of PHP and system logs, which exceeded expected sizes. The automated cleanup job did not trigger effectively, leading to the disk space nearing capacity.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by moving older client installations off the root partition to a separate directory. This allowed for continued access via symlinks while freeing up space on the root partition. Future upgrades to Ubuntu 22 were also planned to further mitigate disk space issues.

## Notes
- The disk space issue should not impact server performance significantly, as confirmed by engineering.
- Manual cleanup requires change control approval from the customer.
- Consider adjusting the alert threshold for disk usage since the server performance is not adversely affected until much higher utilization levels.
