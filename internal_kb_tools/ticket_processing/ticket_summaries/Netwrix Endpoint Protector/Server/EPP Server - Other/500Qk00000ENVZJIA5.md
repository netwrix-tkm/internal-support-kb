## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ENVZJIA5
- **Case Number:** 417980
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FNB - First National Bank
- **Contact Name:** Clint Swartz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying a patch to a virtual machine (VM) running their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server to address a vulnerability, the VM restarted without its IP settings. Attempts to reconfigure the IP settings resulted in an error message stating "Invalid gateway," preventing the appliance from becoming operational.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Affected Component:** EPP Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the VM's network configuration settings post-patch application.
2. Attempted to manually reassign the IP address and gateway settings.
3. Checked for any network interface issues or misconfigurations.
4. Reviewed system logs for any errors related to network settings.
5. Conducted a remote session to further diagnose the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration of the network settings during the patching process, which led to the loss of the IP configuration and the inability to set a valid gateway.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session where the technician:
- Correctly reconfigured the network settings, ensuring that the IP address and gateway were valid and compatible with the network infrastructure.
- Verified that the VM was able to communicate on the network post-configuration.

## Notes
- Ensure that network settings are backed up before applying patches to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify network configurations immediately after any significant changes to the VM environment.
