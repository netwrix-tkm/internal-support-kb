- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IbWt1IAF
- **Case Number:** 427772
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Avrioc Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Naveen Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Archiving Backup Files
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where archiving multiple backup files resulted in an archive being created in a random format. Specifically, when attempting to archive 13 log backup files, the resulting file could not be extracted, even after renaming the file extension.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was attempting to archive files that were already in a compressed format (tar.gz).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team confirmed the issue by asking for clarification on the archiving process.
2. The customer provided details indicating that selecting more than 5 files resulted in a random format archive, while selecting 5 or fewer files produced a ZIP file that was still unextractable.
3. The support team inquired whether the files were being selected individually or in bulk.
4. The support team requested a video demonstration of the archiving process to better understand the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the attempt to re-archive files that were already compressed (tar.gz). The system's handling of multiple compressed files led to inconsistencies in the output format when archiving.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to download the files individually from the EPP UI and then archive them as needed. It was clarified that the feature to archive already compressed files may not function as expected, and users should avoid attempting to re-archive such files.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that archiving files larger than 4GB may fail due to technology limitations.
- It is recommended to download files individually or split larger archives into smaller parts to avoid size-related issues.
- Future users should ensure that they are not attempting to archive files that are already in a compressed format to prevent similar issues.
