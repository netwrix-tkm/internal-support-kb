- **Case Number:** 424051
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RoundRobin Tech Services
- **Contact Name:** Nayan Rajore
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the EPP (Endpoint Protector) client from their laptops. The EPP server had become inaccessible due to a technical issue with their lab server, and they needed to remove the existing clients to set up a temporary server.

## Environment Details
- The EPP client was installed on laptops connected to an on-premises server.
- The existing EPP server was inaccessible, necessitating the uninstallation of the client software.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to uninstall the EPP client using the standard uninstallation wizard.
2. The uninstallation process prompted for a password, which the customer did not possess.
3. The customer reached out to Netwrix support for alternative uninstallation methods.

## Root Cause
The inability to uninstall the EPP client was due to the requirement of a password during the uninstallation process, which the customer did not have access to. This is a security feature designed to prevent unauthorized removal of the software.

## Solution
The customer was provided with guidance on alternative methods to uninstall the EPP client. Although the specific method was not detailed in the case notes, the customer confirmed that they were able to successfully uninstall the clients after receiving support.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers have the necessary credentials before attempting to uninstall the EPP client.
- Consider documenting alternative uninstallation methods for future reference, especially in cases where the standard process is hindered by password protection.
- Follow up with customers to confirm resolution and satisfaction with the support provided.
