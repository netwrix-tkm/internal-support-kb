## Problem Description
The customer, Newspace, experienced a catastrophic incident that resulted in the deletion of their server and all associated data. They created a new server from scratch and requested the transfer of their old license to the new server (ID: IWPDIRG0).

## Environment Details
- The incident involved a physical server that was burnt, leading to the loss of all data and backups.
- The new server was set up with all policies and configurations recreated by the customer.

## Troubleshooting Steps

## Root Cause

## Notes

- It is important to confirm the correct account manager for the customer to avoid delays in resolution.
