- **Case Number:** 428976
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Satcom Infotech
- **Contact Name:** Prasanth Ganesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported an internet connectivity issue when the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) setting was enabled. Disabling the DPI setting resolved the connectivity issue, but enabling it caused significant internet slowness for users.

## Environment Details
- **VPN Application:** Pritunl
- **CAP Policy:** Assigned when the issue occurs

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Disabled the DPI setting to confirm that internet connectivity was restored.
2. Enabled the DPI setting to reproduce the slowness issue.
3. Identified that the issue was related to the VPN connection when a CAP policy was assigned.
4. Enabled the Stealthy DPI option to see if it mitigated the issue.
5. Planned to enable all DPI bypass options to further investigate.
6. Scheduled an update of the Endpoint Protector client from version 6.2.3.1 to 6.2.4.0 and collected logs for analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between the DPI settings and the VPN connection (Pritunl) when a CAP policy was applied, leading to degraded internet performance.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling the Stealthy DPI option, which improved the internet connectivity for users when the DPI setting was enabled. Further steps included enabling DPI bypass options and updating the Endpoint Protector client to ensure compatibility and performance.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the performance after enabling DPI settings in conjunction with VPN connections, especially when CAP policies are applied.
- Future cases should consider testing different DPI settings and VPN configurations to identify potential conflicts early in the troubleshooting process.
