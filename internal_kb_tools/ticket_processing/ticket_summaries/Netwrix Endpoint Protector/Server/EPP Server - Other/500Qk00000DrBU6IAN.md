- **Case Number:** 416773
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that shadowed files were not displayed on the File Maintenance page, and shadowed files could not be found when downloading from the CAP report and file tracing.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on a server running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer was using version 5.9.4.0 of the software.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the absence of shadowed files on the File Maintenance page.
2. Reviewed the CAP report and file tracing to verify the missing shadowed files.
3. Engaged with the Engineering team for insights on the issue.
4. Discussed potential commands for deleting shadow files from the server.
5. Scheduled a remote support session for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the changes made in version 5.9.4.0, where shadows were no longer associated with the PC in the backend. This change affected how shadows were displayed in the UI, leading to confusion regarding their visibility.

## Solution
The customer decided not to proceed with deleting the shadowed files from the backend after understanding the implications. The Engineering team confirmed that shadows could be manipulated from the File Maintenance page, and the shadows could be identified using file hashes. The customer was advised to enable the File Hash column in the CAP Report or File Tracing to assist in identifying shadows.

## Notes
- Deleting shadows from the server will impact the UI; the download button will still appear if the shadow is manually removed.
- It is important to inform customers about the changes in shadow management introduced in version 5.9.4.0 to avoid confusion.
- Future cases should consider the implications of backend changes on UI behavior and file management processes.
