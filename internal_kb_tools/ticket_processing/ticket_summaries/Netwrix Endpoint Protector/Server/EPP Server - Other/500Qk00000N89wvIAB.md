## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N89wvIAB
- **Case Number:** 439429
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TSMC
- **Contact Name:** Jay Mai
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 12.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported several issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system, including:
1. The system log only displays 200 entries despite being set to show 500.
2. Users receive frequent alerts when running Outlook, even after selecting OUTLOOK under CAP Policy to prevent MS Office PST files from being taken out.
3. Questions regarding the ability to block file transfers in applications like WhatsApp while allowing conversations, and whether similar parameters exist for Teams, LINE, and WeChat.

## Environment Details
- The customer operates a consulting company for TSMC.
- The MIS team has limited manpower and has set up multiple groups, each with its own manager.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the customer to navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings to adjust the "Maximum no. of records returned in a report search" setting.
2. Recommended setting "No. of records per report page" to 50 or lower to improve loading times.
3. Advised on turning off client notifications in the CAP policy to reduce alerts for users running Outlook.
4. Clarified that creating a denylist for applications would block them completely, but a Block & Report CAP policy could be used to prevent file transfers while allowing communication.

## Root Cause
The limitation on the number of displayed log entries was due to the default settings in the Global Settings of the Endpoint Protector console. The frequent alerts in Outlook were a result of the CAP policy settings not being configured to suppress notifications effectively.

## Solution
- Adjusted the "Maximum no. of records returned in a report search" to the desired value in the Global Settings.
- Recommended setting the "No. of records per report page" to 50 or lower.
- Instructed the customer on how to turn off client notifications in the CAP policy.
- Explained that while it is not possible to filter logs by groups, administrators can filter by computer or username for reviewing logs of former employees.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that all EPP admins can see all logs, and filtering by groups is not supported.
- For future reference, ensure that customers are aware of the limitations regarding log visibility and the configuration of CAP policies to manage notifications effectively.
