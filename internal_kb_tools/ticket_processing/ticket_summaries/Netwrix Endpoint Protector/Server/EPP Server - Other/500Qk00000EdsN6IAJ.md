- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The EPP (Endpoint Protector) administrator has left the company, and the new admin is unable to log in to complete a necessary hotfix. There was uncertainty regarding whether the new admin had the required EPP access.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

2. Attempted to verify if the new admin had EPP access.
3. Conducted a remote session to assist with the login issue.
4. Reset user credentials during the remote session.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the departure of the previous EPP admin, which resulted in the new admin lacking the necessary access credentials to log in to the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the user credentials for the new admin during a remote support session. This allowed the new admin to successfully log in and complete the required hotfix.

- It may be beneficial to document the credentials and access rights of all admins to facilitate smoother transitions.
