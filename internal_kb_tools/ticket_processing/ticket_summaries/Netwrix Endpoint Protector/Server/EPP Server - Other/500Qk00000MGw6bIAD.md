## Problem Description
All administrators were unable to access the EPP portal after entering the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) code, receiving an error indicating that the MFA was incorrect.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The server time was found to be out of sync with the local time.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the MFA process and confirmed that the error was consistent across all admin accounts.
2. Investigated the server settings and time configuration.
3. Identified that the server time did not match the local time.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch between the server time and the local time, which affected the MFA validation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by synchronizing the server time with the local time, ensuring that the MFA codes generated were valid and correctly recognized by the system.

## Notes
- Ensure that server time is regularly synchronized with local time to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing monitoring for time discrepancies to proactively address potential MFA-related access issues.
