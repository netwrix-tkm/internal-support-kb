- **Case Number:** 422282
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The client reported that certain clients were not displayed in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console, despite being connected. The issue was referenced in a previous case (Case: 00419239).

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- Log files and screenshots were provided by the client for further analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the log files and screenshots provided by the client.
2. Escalated the issue to the engineering team for deeper investigation.
3. Conducted a remote session with the client to diagnose the problem.
4. Identified that multiple computers with the same name existed on the node, causing confusion in the system.
5. Confirmed that the issue was related to how previous versions handled deletions of computers.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict arising from multiple computers having the same name on the node. This was due to the previous version's method of soft-deleting computers, which led to communication issues with the Endpoint Protector console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a temporary fix during the remote session. It was confirmed that the problem would be permanently addressed in the upcoming 7.2.0 patch release. The client was informed that the client is now listed in the logs, and the fix was confirmed to be effective for the specific client in question.

## Notes
- Similar issues may arise with computers that were previously deleted in older versions of the software.
- It is recommended to ensure unique naming conventions for computers to avoid conflicts in the future.
- Monitor for any similar reports after the deployment of the 7.2.0 patch to ensure the issue is fully resolved.
