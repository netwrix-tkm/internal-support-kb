- **Case Number:** 417031
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Denni Prima Putra Roli
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Bank Aladin Syayriah, requested a change of their current EPP server URL to a more identifiable one and needed the public static IP address of the EPP server for whitelisting in their firewall.

## Environment Details
- Current EPP Server URL: `https://tu4njym.hosted.endpointprotector.com`
- Requested EPP Server URL: `https://aladinbank.hosted.endpointprotector.com`
- Public IP Address for whitelisting: Required for integration with Active Directory (AD) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the feasibility of changing the server URL.
2. Discussed the necessary steps and requirements for deployment on endpoints.
3. Identified the current public IP address of the EPP server using a ping command.
4. Verified that the identified IP address was static and uniquely assigned to the Bank Aladin EC2 appliance.

## Root Cause
The need for a more identifiable URL arose from customer branding requirements, and the public IP address was necessary for secure integration with their existing systems.

## Solution
- The URL change was confirmed as feasible, and the new URL was set to `https://aladinbank.hosted.endpointprotector.com`.
- The public static IP address `108.137.105.248` was provided to the customer for whitelisting purposes, confirming it was a static AWS Elastic IP assigned to their EPP server.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future URL changes are communicated clearly to the customer, including any potential impacts on their existing configurations.
- Always verify the static nature of IP addresses before providing them for whitelisting to avoid connectivity issues.
