## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GKZq1IAH
- **Case Number:** 422280
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Missing Events in Reports
- **Version:** 7.2.0 (improvement noted for future patch)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that certain events, such as activation, blocking, and connecting of devices (specifically BeatBuds x1), were visible under devices but were missing from the reports in the console.

## Environment Details
- The Endpoint Protector Agent was distributed using SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager).
- The installation was performed with the system user.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation**: Reviewed logs and confirmed that no events of type "Blocked" had been recorded since October 17, 2024.
2. **Service Restart**: The service was restarted using PsExec, which allows command execution on the client regardless of user login status.
3. **Communication Check**: Verified that the agent could restart services without being logged in, which raised questions about the empty username in logs.
4. **Log Analysis**: Analyzed backend logs and confirmed that there were no new logs waiting to be processed.
5. **Resource Optimization**: Increased the number of workers on the server side to improve log processing efficiency.
6. **Follow-up Meetings**: Scheduled multiple follow-up meetings to discuss findings and next steps with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the missing events was identified as a combination of:
- An empty username in logs when no users were logged into the PCs, leading to incomplete event reporting.
- Backend processing issues that resulted in a backlog of logs, which were not being processed correctly.

## Solution
- The engineering team implemented an increase in server resources and worker numbers, which allowed for better processing of logs.
- Improvements were made to the system to ensure that logs would be processed correctly in future versions (notably in version 7.2.0).
- The customer was informed that the issues with missing events had been resolved, and they were advised to monitor the system for any further discrepancies.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are logged in when testing the functionality of the Endpoint Protector Agent, as this can affect log reporting.
- Future updates should include monitoring for empty usernames in logs and ensuring that backend processing is optimized to handle high volumes of logs efficiently.
- The customer should be advised to check the UI for any inconsistencies after server resource increases and to report any further issues promptly.
