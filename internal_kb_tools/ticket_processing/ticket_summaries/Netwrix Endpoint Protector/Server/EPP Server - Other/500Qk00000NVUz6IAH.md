- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the DPI (Data Loss Prevention) configuration in their DLP (Data Loss Prevention) system had a global setting that prevented all users from logging into Gmail and Google Drive on their PCs. However, specific users required access to these services without uninstalling the client.

## Environment Details
- **DLP Configuration:** Global DPI settings enabled
- **Policies:** Both CAP (Content Aware Protection) and DPI policies were active

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that both CAP and DPI policies were enabled, which were blocking access to Google services.
2. Suggested removing specific users from the CAP policy to allow them to log in.
3. Recommended creating an offline temporary password for the users needing access.
4. Followed up with the customer to check if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the combination of active CAP and DPI policies that globally restricted access to Google services for all users.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by removing the affected users from the CAP policy, which allowed them to log into Gmail and Google Drive without needing to uninstall the client. The customer confirmed that the issue was resolved after implementing this change.

## Notes
- It is important to review the CAP and DPI settings when configuring access to specific applications to avoid unintended restrictions.
- Future cases may benefit from checking both CAP and DPI configurations when users report access issues to specific services.
