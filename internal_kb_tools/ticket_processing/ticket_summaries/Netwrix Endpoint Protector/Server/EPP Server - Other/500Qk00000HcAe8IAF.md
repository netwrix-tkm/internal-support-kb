- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HcAe8IAF
- **Case Number:** 425369
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Configure Max File Size
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the functionality of the "Configure Max File Size" feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). They reported that despite setting the maximum file size to 5MB for Excel files, EPP continued to block Excel files larger than this limit. They questioned whether the CAP policy might have stopped scanning these large files after detecting confidential data.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the "Configure Max File Size" feature to ensure it was set correctly to 5MB for Excel files.
2. Verified the CAP (Content Aware Protection) policy settings to check if they were configured to scan for confidential data regardless of file size.
3. Conducted tests by attempting to transfer Excel files larger than 5MB to observe the behavior of the EPP system.
4. Consulted documentation regarding the interaction between the Max File Size feature and CAP policies.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misunderstanding of how the "Configure Max File Size" feature interacts with the CAP policy. The feature is designed to disable CAP scanning for files larger than the specified size; however, if a file is detected to contain confidential data before reaching the size limit, the CAP policy can still block the file.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying the functionality of the "Configure Max File Size" feature to the customer. It was explained that while the feature disables scanning for files larger than the set limit, the CAP policy can still intervene if confidential data is detected within the file. The customer was advised to review their CAP policy settings to ensure they align with their intended file handling procedures.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that the "Configure Max File Size" feature does not override CAP policies if confidential data is detected.
- Future inquiries regarding file blocking should include a review of both the Max File Size settings and the CAP policy configurations to ensure comprehensive troubleshooting.
