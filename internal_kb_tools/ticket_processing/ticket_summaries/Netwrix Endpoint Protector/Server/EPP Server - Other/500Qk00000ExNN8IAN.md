## Problem Description
The customer reported that the server UI was inaccessible, stating that it had been functioning properly until a sudden change occurred approximately 15 minutes prior to the report.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) on the customer's side.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the server's status and services.

4. Confirmed that the nginx service was not operational (failed status).
5. Requested the `/opt/aminetconfig.sh` file for comparison.
6. Provided commands to move the nginx configuration file and restart the nginx service:
   ```bash
   mv /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/setup.epp.conf /home/epproot
   service nginx restart
   ```

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the nginx service being in a failed state, which prevented access to the server UI.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing the provided commands to move the nginx configuration file and restart the nginx service. This restored functionality to the server UI.

## Notes
- Ensure that the nginx service is monitored regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Keep a backup of the nginx configuration files to facilitate quick recovery in case of service failures.
- Document any changes made to the server configuration to assist in troubleshooting future issues.
