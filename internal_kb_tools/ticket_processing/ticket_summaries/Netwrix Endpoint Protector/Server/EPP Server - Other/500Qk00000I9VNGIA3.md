## Problem Description
The customer reported that newly installed clients were not receiving licenses, despite available free licenses on the server. Additionally, the "Last seen" date for existing clients was incorrectly displayed as "2024-10-14".

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The server was configured correctly with available licenses.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to check if the agent was communicating with the server by accessing the agent UI and sending a screenshot.
2. The customer confirmed that the agent was communicating but noted that fields for Administrator, Phone, and Email were empty.
3. The support team suggested uninstalling and reinstalling the client, ensuring the correct IP, port, and department were configured during installation.
4. The customer attempted the reinstallation twice on different clients and also tried a previous client version, but the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration related to client registration settings, specifically the Client Registration Certificate and Communication Security settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Disabling the Client Registration Certificate.
- Increasing the Communication Security settings on the server.

These changes allowed the new clients to properly register and receive licenses and policies.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Client Registration Certificate is configured correctly for new installations.
- Monitor the Communication Security settings, as they can impact client registration and communication with the server.
- For future cases, verify that all required fields (Administrator, Phone, Email) are populated to avoid confusion during troubleshooting.
