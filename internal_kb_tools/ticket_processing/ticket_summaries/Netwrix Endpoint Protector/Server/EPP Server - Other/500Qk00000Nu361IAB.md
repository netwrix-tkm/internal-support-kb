- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** E-Data Teknoloji Pazarlama

## Problem Description
The customer, Turknet, reported an issue where certificates were not automatically added as trusted certificates during the deployment of agents on MacBook computers using Mobile Device Management (MDM). This resulted in access problems to the site.

## Environment Details
- **MDM Solution Used:** WorkSpace One (VMware)
- **MacBook OS Version:** MacOS 15 and above
- **Third-party Application:** Used for deploying the EPP MacOS client

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with a knowledge base article on deploying agents through JAMF, which included instructions on adding certificates while configuring the profile.
2. Clarified that the customer was using WorkSpace One instead of JAMF and suggested they contact VMware support for assistance with their MDM deployment.
3. Discussed the need for a script to load the agent's certificate during deployment.
4. Responded to customer inquiries regarding the DPI certificate and its configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the fact that the MDM solution (WorkSpace One) did not automatically add the required certificates as trusted during the agent installation process. This was compounded by the customer's use of a third-party application for deployment, which did not have the necessary configurations set to handle certificate trust.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Providing the customer with a detailed knowledge base article that outlined how to add certificates during the agent deployment process.
- Advising the customer to work with the support team of the third-party application (WorkSpace One) to ensure proper deployment configurations were in place.
- Clarifying that enabling the DPI certificate option would allow the necessary certificates to be downloaded and deployed correctly.

## Notes
- It is important for customers using MDM solutions to ensure that the deployment scripts include commands to trust certificates automatically.
- Future deployments should verify that the correct MDM solution is being used and that all necessary configurations are set to avoid similar issues.
- If issues persist, customers should be directed to the support teams of their MDM solutions for further assistance.
