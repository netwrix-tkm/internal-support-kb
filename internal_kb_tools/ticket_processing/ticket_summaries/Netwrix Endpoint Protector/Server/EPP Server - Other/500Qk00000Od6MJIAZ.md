## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with updating an expired web certificate. The normal fields in the server were not accepting the newly generated certificates, and they requested guidance on the proper procedure for generating and uploading the certificates.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

2. Followed up with the customer after they reported continued errors when uploading the server certificate.
3. Offered to schedule a remote session to assist further.
4. Awaited confirmation from the customer regarding the success of the certificate upload.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer attempting to upload encrypted certificate files without decrypting them first. The server was unable to accept the certificates in their encrypted form.

## Solution
The customer independently resolved the issue by decrypting the certificate files before attempting to upload them again. Once the files were decrypted, they successfully uploaded the certificate without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need to decrypt certificate files before uploading them to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Providing a detailed procedure for certificate generation and upload can help prevent confusion and streamline the process for users.
