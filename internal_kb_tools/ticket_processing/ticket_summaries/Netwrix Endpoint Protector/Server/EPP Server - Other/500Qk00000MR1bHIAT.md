## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to release licenses for two machines that no longer existed in their environment. Although these machines still appeared as licensed, they did not show up in the search results.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The customer had previously removed the two machines from their infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reported the issue and provided screenshots.
2. Accessed the backend to attempt to remove the licenses.
3. Reached out to the customer for permission to access the backend.
4. Coordinated with Flaviu for assistance in accessing the backend.
5. Requested Bogdan Melinte to place the `connectedProcedure.sql` file in the `/home/epproot/` directory on the hosted EPP server.
6. Sent status updates to the customer throughout the process.
7. Completed the procedure to remove the licenses and force re-registration of all computers.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the two machines were still showing as licensed in the system despite being removed from the customer's environment. This discrepancy was due to the licenses not being properly released in the backend.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by accessing the backend and executing the necessary procedures to remove the licenses associated with the two unlicensed computers. After completing these steps, the customer confirmed that the two machines no longer appeared in the search results, and all other computers were reporting correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that any machines removed from the environment are also unlicensed in the system to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always confirm with the customer before accessing backend systems to maintain transparency and security.
- Regularly check for updates or changes in the backend procedures that may affect license management.
