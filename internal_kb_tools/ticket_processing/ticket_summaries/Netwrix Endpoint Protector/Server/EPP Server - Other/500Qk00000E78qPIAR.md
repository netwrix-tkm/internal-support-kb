## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to access the SSH server, specifically the EPP terminal, and requested guidance on the procedure to gain access.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the access permissions for the SSH server.
2. Confirmed that the SSH service was running on the server.
3. Checked firewall settings to ensure that SSH traffic was allowed.
4. Attempted to connect to the SSH server using different credentials.
5. Verified network connectivity to the server from the client machine.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a lack of access permissions for the user attempting to connect to the SSH server. No access to SSH was provided to the user, which prevented them from establishing a connection.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the user did not have the necessary permissions to access the SSH server. The support team communicated that no access to SSH could be provided, which clarified the situation for the customer.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions before attempting to access the SSH server.
- Future requests for SSH access should include a review of user permissions and roles to avoid similar issues.
