## Problem Description
The customer, Port of Salalah, requested assistance in configuring Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies in "Report & Block" mode with alert notifications for file transfer, copy, delete, and print operations. The current configuration was set to "Report only mode," which did not meet their audit requirements.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The DLP policies were initially configured in "Report only mode."

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with a guide on changing the CAP policy type from "Report only" to "Block & Report."
2. Scheduled a remote session to discuss the customer's questions and requirements.
3. During the remote session:
   - Explained how CAP policies work, including thresholds, exit points, custom dictionaries, and user selection.
   - Changed a policy from "Report only" to "Block & Report" for testing.
   - Adjusted the client mode from Hidden to Normal to enable notifications.
   - Demonstrated how to create custom templates for CAP notifications.
   - Noted that blocking the print screen in a CAP policy caused screen sharing in Zoom and Teams to turn black.
4. Scheduled additional remote sessions to troubleshoot and test with other applications.
5. Followed up with the customer to ensure they were satisfied with the changes and to address any further questions.

## Root Cause
The initial configuration of DLP policies was set to "Report only," which did not fulfill the customer's audit requirements for blocking sensitive data actions and notifying users.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Changing the DLP policy settings from "Report only" to "Block & Report."
- Setting up alert notifications for file transfer, copy, delete, and print operations.
- Providing guidance on how to effectively manage and customize DLP policies to minimize impact on end users.

## Notes
- It was observed that if the print screen function is blocked in a CAP policy, screen sharing in monitored applications (Zoom and Teams) may turn black. This issue should be monitored and potentially escalated if it persists.
- The customer was advised to continue testing the new configurations and report any further issues. The ticket was kept open for a few days to ensure no additional problems arose.
