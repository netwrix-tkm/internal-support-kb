## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to log in to the EPP Server UI. The system prompted them to change their password but did not accept the old password during the process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **User Account:** System administrator "root"

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer.
2. Attempted to reset the password for the EPP Server UI system administrator "root".
3. After logging in, the customer set a new password.
4. Verified successful authentication and navigation within the EPP Server UI.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely due to a mismatch or corruption in the password authentication process, which prevented the old password from being accepted during the password change prompt.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a password reset for the "root" account in the EPP Server UI. After the reset, the customer was able to set a new password successfully and log in without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that password policies are clearly communicated to users to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If users encounter similar login issues, consider performing a password reset as a first troubleshooting step.
