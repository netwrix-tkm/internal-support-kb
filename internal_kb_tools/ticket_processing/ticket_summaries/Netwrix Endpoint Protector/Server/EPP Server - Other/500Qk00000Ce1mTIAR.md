## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ce1mTIAR
- **Case Number:** 414006
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Deloitte Services LP
- **Contact Name:** Marc-Anthony Murray
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** AD Sync
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5930

## Problem Description
Deloitte US reported issues with Active Directory (AD) synchronization in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) system. Following changes made to their AD, approximately 2000 users were found to be unassociated with any groups, resulting in the absence of policy enforcement for these users.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Users:** Approximately 2000
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **EPP Server Version:** 5930

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the AD sync was functioning without errors.
2. Investigated the group associations of the affected users.
3. Reviewed the changes made in AD, specifically the alteration of the Common Name (CN) for users.
4. Engaged with engineering support to analyze the synchronization logs.
5. Suggested recreating the sync on the EPP UI to ensure proper group assignments.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the failure to include the relevant group in the Organizational Unit (OU) that was synced from AD. This omission led to the affected users not being associated with any groups in the EPP system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the necessary group to the OU that was synced from AD. Once the group was included, the synchronization process was re-executed, and the affected users were successfully imported into the EPP UI with the correct group associations, allowing policies to be enforced.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future changes to AD, particularly those affecting user attributes like CN, are communicated to the EPP support team to prevent similar issues.
- Regularly verify group memberships and synchronization settings after making changes in AD to maintain policy enforcement across all users.
