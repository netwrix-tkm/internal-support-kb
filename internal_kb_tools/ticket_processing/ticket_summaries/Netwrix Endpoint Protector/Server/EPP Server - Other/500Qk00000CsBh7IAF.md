- **Case Number:** 414573
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the cososys console on a browser after setting up a cososys server in Hyper-V. During the booting stage, an error message appeared stating, "failed to start a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server." Although the server was reachable via ping, the console access issue persisted.

## Environment Details
- **Virtualization Platform:** Hyper-V
- **Network Configuration:** Initially configured with one network interface card (NIC).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the error message was not relevant to the console access issue.
2. Inquired whether two network cards were assigned to the VM image.
3. Customer confirmed that only one NIC was assigned.
4. Advised the customer to ensure that two network bridged cards were assigned to the VM.

## Root Cause
The inability to access the console was due to the configuration of the virtual machine, which only had one network interface card (NIC) assigned. The application required two NICs for proper operation and access.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to add a second network adapter to the virtual machine configuration. Once the second NIC was added and properly configured, the customer was able to access the cososys console on the browser.

## Notes
- Ensure that virtual machines running applications requiring web access are configured with the appropriate number of network adapters.
- For future cases, always verify network configurations as a first step in troubleshooting access issues related to web applications.
