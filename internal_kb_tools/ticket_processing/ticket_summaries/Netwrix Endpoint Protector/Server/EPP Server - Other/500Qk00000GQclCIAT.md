## Problem Description
The customer reported an unintentional increase in file shadows and sought a more efficient method to view and delete specific unwanted shadow files. They found the folder names listed under "File Maintenance" to be unclear and not user-friendly for searching specific files.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer navigated to "File Maintenance" under "System Maintenance" and accessed "Shadow Files."
2. They attempted to click through the listed folder names to locate specific files.
3. The customer acknowledged the options under "Audit Log Backup" but confirmed it was not the desired solution.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the lack of meaningful folder names in the "Shadow Files" section, making it difficult for users to identify and manage specific shadow files effectively.

## Solution
The support technician resolved the issue by deleting the requested `.nde` files as per the customer's request. This action helped to manage the file shadows effectively.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are aware of the limitations in the naming conventions of shadow files, as this can lead to confusion when managing files.
- Future enhancements to the user interface could improve the clarity of folder names to facilitate easier navigation and management of shadow files.
