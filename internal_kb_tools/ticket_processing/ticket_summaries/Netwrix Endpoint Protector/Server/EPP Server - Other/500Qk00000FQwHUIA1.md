## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FQwHUIA1
- **Case Number:** 420321
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chapman and Cutler LLP
- **Contact Name:** Veronica Yessa
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.0.0 and later

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading their EPP server to version 5.9.0.0 and subsequent versions, they were unable to apply Backend Security Updates. Each attempt resulted in the updates failing to apply, leading to a repetitive cycle where the same updates reappeared.

## Environment Details
- The issue began occurring after upgrading to EPP server versions 5810 or 5900.
- The boot partition of the EPP server was found to be close to or at 100% capacity, which contributed to the failure of applying updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the EPP server version and confirmed the issue began post-upgrade.
2. Checked for available Backend Security Updates and noted the repeated appearance of the same updates after failed attempts to apply them.
3. Investigated the backend and confirmed that the boot partition was nearly full.
4. Conducted a remote session with the customer to apply clean boot partition steps.
5. Cleared space in the boot partition to allow for the application of updates.
6. Communicated with R&D regarding the need for an automated script to manage boot partition space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the boot partition being full, which prevented the successful application of Backend Security Updates after each EPP server upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing space in the boot partition, which allowed the updates to be applied successfully.
- Informed the customer that an automated script for managing boot partition space is still in development, and until it is available, they should continue to manually clear space as needed.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the boot partition space after each EPP server upgrade to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to perform regular maintenance on their server to manage disk space effectively.
- The development of an automated script to handle boot partition management is ongoing; updates should be communicated to the customer once available.
