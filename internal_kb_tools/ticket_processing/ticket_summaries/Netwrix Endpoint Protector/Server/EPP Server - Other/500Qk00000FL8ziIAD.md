## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FL8ziIAD
- **Case Number:** 420072
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AutoFi
- **Contact Name:** Jayme Villafranca
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where their endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution ceased to inspect traffic after enabling a Secure Web Gateway (SWG) add-on for their VPN on macOS devices. The SWG was designed to inspect web traffic against a list of malicious sites, but its activation interfered with the DLP's functionality.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS
- **VPN Solution:** Not specified
- **DLP Solution:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)
- **SWG Solution:** Perimeter81 Secure Web Gateway

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer enabled the SWG, which caused the DLP to stop inspecting traffic.
2. The VPN provider recommended creating a bypass rule for the EPP service (`com.cososys.eppclient`).
3. The bypass rule was implemented, allowing the DLP to resume traffic inspection.
4. The customer sought a solution to allow both the DLP and SWG to inspect traffic simultaneously without interference.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the conflict between the SWG and the DLP, where enabling the SWG caused the DLP to stop functioning due to traffic being routed through the SWG instead of the DLP.

## Solution
The customer found a workaround by implementing a bypass rule for the DLP service, which allowed the DLP to function correctly. However, this resulted in the SWG being unable to inspect the same traffic. The resolution involved advising the customer to explore configurations that would allow both tools to operate without interference, although a definitive solution was not provided in this case.

## Notes
- Future configurations involving multiple proxies on macOS should consider potential conflicts and the need for specific bypass rules.
- It is recommended to test any new configurations in a controlled environment before deploying them widely.
- Customers should be informed that simultaneous inspection by multiple proxies may require advanced configuration and may not always be feasible.
