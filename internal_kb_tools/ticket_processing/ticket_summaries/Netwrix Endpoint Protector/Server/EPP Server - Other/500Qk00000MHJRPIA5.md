## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MHJRPIA5
- **Case Number:** 436896
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Halodata International Pte Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Halodata Support Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the detection of custom content using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. While the same policy successfully detected other identifiers such as regex and CCN, it failed to work with the custom content dictionary.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the Issue:** 5.9

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided a video demonstration of the issue along with client logs in a zip file.
2. Support conducted several tests to analyze the functionality of the custom content dictionary.
3. It was determined that the existing custom content dictionary was not enforcing the block policy as expected.
4. A new custom policy was created using identical keywords to the original custom content dictionary.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a malfunction in the specific custom content dictionary that the customer was using. This dictionary was unable to enforce the block policy effectively.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating a new custom content dictionary that replicated the keywords from the original. After implementing the new dictionary, the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was able to successfully block the words that matched the criteria.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the integrity of custom content dictionaries before deployment to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If a custom content dictionary fails to enforce policies, consider recreating it as a potential solution.
