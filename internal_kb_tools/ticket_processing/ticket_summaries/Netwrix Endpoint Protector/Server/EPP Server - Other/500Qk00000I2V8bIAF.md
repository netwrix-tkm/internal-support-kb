## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I2V8bIAF
- **Case Number:** 426465
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Powerweave
- **Contact Name:** Alizain Patel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Log Reports & File Tracing
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to export logs associated with specific policy names and groups created in the "Reports & Analysis" section, particularly under the tabs for Log Reports and File Tracing. They could export logs using the Content Aware Report feature, but not from the expected sections.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The logs were expected to be generated based on user-defined policies and groups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment:** Reviewed the customer's report and confirmed the inability to export logs from specified sections.
2. **Remote Session:** Scheduled a remote session with the customer to further investigate the issue.
3. **Testing:** During the session, attempted to demonstrate the log export functionality but encountered issues with blocking files.
4. **Engineering Escalation:** Forwarded the issue to the Engineering team for deeper analysis after the initial troubleshooting did not yield results.
5. **Policy Review:** Suggested the customer disable the URL category policy that might be affecting log visibility.
6. **Log Verification:** Requested screenshots from the customer to better understand the log output and limitations.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the URL category policy being enabled, which restricted the content scanning to only the requested URLs. This limitation affected the visibility and export of logs, resulting in only a maximum of 200 entries being displayed regardless of the date range specified.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to:
1. Disable the URL category policy that was previously set.
2. Save the changes and update the policies on the client systems.
3. After these adjustments, the log export functionality was successfully restored, allowing the customer to access the expected logs.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that URL category policies are configured correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to check their policy settings if they encounter limitations in log visibility or export functionality.
- Regular follow-ups with the Engineering team may be necessary for complex issues that require deeper analysis.
