## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E7B58IAF
- **Case Number:** 417357
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Diakonie Herzogsägmühle Peiting
- **Contact Name:** Christoph Zeitler
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with administrator synchronization in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). They had previously created local administrators with usernames matching those in Active Directory (AD) but had not activated synchronization at that time. After activating synchronization and deleting local users, the previously local usernames were not being synchronized from AD.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that synchronization was activated in the EPP settings.
2. Confirmed that local users were deleted prior to activating synchronization.
3. Checked the Active Directory for the existence of the usernames.
4. Reviewed synchronization logs for any errors or warnings.
5. Attempted to manually trigger synchronization to see if it would resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the presence of previously created local users in EPP that were not properly cleaned up before synchronization was activated. This prevented the synchronization process from recognizing and syncing the corresponding AD users.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a support session by ensuring that all local users were completely removed from the EPP system. After confirming the deletion, the synchronization process was re-triggered, which successfully synchronized the AD users with the EPP system.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that all local users are deleted before activating synchronization to avoid conflicts.
- Future implementations should include a verification step to confirm that no local users exist before enabling synchronization.
- Regular checks of synchronization logs can help identify potential issues early in the process.
