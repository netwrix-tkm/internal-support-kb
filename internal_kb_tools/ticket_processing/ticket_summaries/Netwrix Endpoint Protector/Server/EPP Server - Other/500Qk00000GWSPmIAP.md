## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had access to a new setup but lacked full admin control on the console. They requested assistance to resolve the permission issue.

## Environment Details
- User ID: mbelagali (mahesh.belagali@wottonkearney.com.au)
- Platform: Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the user's current permissions and roles within the console.
2. Checked the backend settings for admin roles and permissions.
3. Attempted to escalate the user's permissions through standard procedures.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by insufficient permissions assigned to the user's account, which did not allow full admin access to the console.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by changing the admin user role from the backend, granting the user full admin control on the console.

## Notes
- Ensure that user roles are properly assigned during initial setup to avoid similar permission issues in the future.
- Regular audits of user permissions may help in identifying and resolving access issues proactively.
