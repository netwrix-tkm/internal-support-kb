## Problem Description
The customer reported experiencing session timeout messages every 14 minutes, despite having configured the session timeout settings to 15 minutes of inactivity. The customer sought clarification on whether this behavior was a bug or if the session timeout was indeed set regardless of user activity.

## Environment Details
- **Session Timeout (min):** 15
- **Timeout Counter (sec):** 60

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the session timeout settings configured by the customer.
2. Consulted the online documentation regarding session timeout behavior.
3. Escalated the issue to the engineering team for further investigation.
4. Confirmed with the engineering team regarding the intended functionality of the session timeout settings.

## Root Cause
The session timeout behavior was functioning as intended. The timeout settings are designed to apply regardless of user activity, which was not clearly communicated in the existing documentation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that the session timeout is indeed set regardless of activity or inactivity. It was recommended that the documentation be updated to reflect this behavior to avoid future confusion.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that documentation clearly states the behavior of session timeouts to prevent misunderstandings.
- Future inquiries regarding session timeouts should reference this case to clarify the intended functionality.
