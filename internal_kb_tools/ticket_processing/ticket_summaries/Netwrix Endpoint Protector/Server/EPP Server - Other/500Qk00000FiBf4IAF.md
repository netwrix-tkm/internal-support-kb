## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FiBf4IAF
- **Case Number:** 420924
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KMS-Technology
- **Contact Name:** Xuan Nguyen
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about modifying the URL for the Endpoint Protector administrator webpage from `https://epp.kms-technology.com/.` to `https://epp.kms-technology.com:4443`.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the configuration of the Endpoint Protector administrator webpage.
- The customer reported a high volume of logs, which they suspected was due to the GitHub Client application.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team suggested disabling the GitHub Client under "Cloud Services / File Sharing" to reduce the number of false positive logs.
2. The customer was advised to enable debug logging and reproduce the issue to capture relevant logs for further analysis.
3. A remote session was scheduled to perform a health check on the EPP server and identify potential improvements.

## Root Cause
The high volume of logs was primarily caused by the GitHub Client application, which generated numerous event logs by reporting all files accessed, even if they were not transferred. This resulted in many false positives in the Content Aware Report.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the GitHub Client application, which significantly reduced the number of logs generated. The customer confirmed that the logs were fewer and requested to close the case.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the logs after making changes to application settings to ensure that the volume of logs remains manageable.
- If similar issues arise in the future, consider reviewing the applications in use and their logging behavior to identify potential sources of excessive logging.
