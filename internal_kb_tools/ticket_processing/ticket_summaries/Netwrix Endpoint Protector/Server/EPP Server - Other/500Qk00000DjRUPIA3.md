## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DjRUPIA3
- **Case Number:** 416448
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Blend Lab
- **Contact Name:** jeffrey plotts
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that AWS GuardDuty identified their EPP server connecting to a Cisco DNS server, specifically flagged as "CISCO-UMBRELLA." The alert indicated that the EC2 instance (i-00960c768ae55343a) was communicating with an unusual DNS resolver (208.67.222.222). The customer inquired whether this behavior was expected.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **EC2 Instance ID:** i-00960c768ae55343a
- **DNS Resolver:** 208.67.222.222 (Cisco Umbrella)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the AWS GuardDuty alert details to understand the nature of the DNS resolver flagged.
2. Verified the configuration of the EPP server to check for any unusual DNS settings.
3. Consulted documentation regarding expected DNS behavior for Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
4. Engaged with internal resources to determine if the use of Cisco Umbrella DNS was a known configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be a false positive. The EPP server was configured to use Cisco Umbrella as a DNS resolver, which is a legitimate and expected configuration for enhanced security and threat protection.

## Solution
The inquiry was resolved by confirming that the use of Cisco Umbrella DNS (208.67.222.222) by the EPP server is expected behavior. The customer was informed that this configuration is common and does not indicate any security issue.

## Notes
- It is important to document any unusual DNS resolver alerts in AWS GuardDuty and verify their legitimacy against known configurations.
- Future inquiries regarding DNS resolver alerts should include a review of the server's DNS settings to confirm expected behavior.
- Customers should be educated on the use of third-party DNS services like Cisco Umbrella to prevent unnecessary alarm regarding their security configurations.
