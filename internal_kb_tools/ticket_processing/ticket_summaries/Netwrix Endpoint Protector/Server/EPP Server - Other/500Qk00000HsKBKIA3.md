## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HsKBKIA3
- **Case Number:** 425971
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PROOF
- **Contact Name:** Samantha Skinner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Device Control
- **Version:** 14.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported difficulty in deleting old computers from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console. Despite attempts to manually delete these devices from the Device Control > Computers section, they reappeared. Additionally, the customer noted a discrepancy in the number of computers displayed versus those exported to CSV, with only 200 devices being exported despite seeing over 300 in the console.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation:** Verified the issue of computers reappearing after deletion.
2. **Remote Session:** Conducted a remote session with the customer to troubleshoot the problem.
3. **Settings Adjustment:** Increased the maximum number of records returned in a report search from 200 to 5000 in Device Control > Global Settings.
4. **Manual Deletion:** Attempted to delete the computers again during the session.
5. **Monitoring:** Left the ticket open for a few days to monitor if deleted computers reappeared.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a lack of an automatic deletion setting for offline and unlicensed computers, which caused previously deleted devices to reappear in the console. The discrepancy in the CSV export was due to a limitation in the number of records displayed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting all offline and unlicensed computers during the remote session.
- Confirming that the deleted computers did not reappear after the purge.
- Adjusting the settings to allow for a higher number of records to be displayed in the console.

## Notes
- There is currently no automatic deletion feature for offline and unlicensed computers; manual deletion is required.
- If the issue of reappearing computers occurs again, it may be necessary to check for any synchronization settings or external factors that could be causing the devices to re-register in the system.
- The customer should monitor the situation for any recurrence of the issue and report back if it happens.
