## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hd29pIAB
- **Case Number:** 425420
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BayPort Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Zac Cornett
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were not receiving test emails from the server or alerts, indicating an issue with the SMTP functionality.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the SMTP server settings in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector configuration.
2. Checked network connectivity to the SMTP server.
3. Reviewed firewall settings to ensure that SMTP traffic was not being blocked.
4. Attempted to send test emails to confirm the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the use of a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the SMTP server in the settings, which was not resolving correctly. The customer needed to create a static DNS record for the EPP server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to:
1. Create a static DNS record for the EPP server.
2. Update the SMTP server settings to use the server's IP address instead of the FQDN.

## Notes
- Ensure that static DNS records are properly configured for any servers used in SMTP settings to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify that the correct IP address is being used in configurations to prevent resolution issues.
