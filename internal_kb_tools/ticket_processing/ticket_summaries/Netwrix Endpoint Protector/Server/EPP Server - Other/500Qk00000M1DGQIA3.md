## Problem Description
The customer, Support your app, reported issues with the integration of their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. They also requested a remote session to review backend configurations on their server.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The server is configured to send logs to the SIEM.

## Troubleshooting Steps
