## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P43dkIAB
- **Case Number:** 444806
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CETUS TECHNOLOGY
- **Contact Name:** Robinson Montoya
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5941

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) software was malfunctioning and not displaying statistics correctly. Additionally, multiple users were unable to connect to the EPP server.

## Environment Details
- The customer has a total of 49 laptops, with 5 laptops being the most recently installed and affected.
- The EPP Appliance was accessed via public IP.
- The SSL certificate for the domain cetus.com.co had been changed recently.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Joined remote sessions with the customer on multiple occasions to diagnose the issue.
2. Verified that the EPP Appliance had a recent snapshot.
3. Reviewed system settings and regenerated the server certificate stack.
4. Tested the connection from a client machine to the EPP Appliance, which was successful.
5. Assisted the customer in configuring AzureAD on the EPP Appliance.
6. Checked user accounts in the EPP console for AzureAD settings.
7. Attempted to ping the EPP Appliance IP, which failed.
8. Rebooted the EPP Appliance and affected client machines.
9. Reinstalled the EPP client on affected machines.
10. Inspected network configurations and firewall settings.
11. Enabled debug mode on a known good client and collected logs for comparison.
12. Provided the customer with documentation to configure SSO using AzureAD.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to the server certificate configuration and AzureAD settings for user accounts. The regeneration of the server certificate stack initially caused login issues for the customer.

## Solution
- Regenerated the server certificate stack and configured the Server PEM/KEY Certificate under Appliance > Server Maintenance > Server Certificate.
- Advised the customer to use private mode in their browser to access the EPP Console after regenerating the certificate.
- After allowing time for the changes to take effect, the customer successfully logged into the EPP console and confirmed that all computers were communicating with the EPP Appliance.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to SSL certificates are communicated to users to avoid login issues.
- When configuring AzureAD, verify that all user accounts are correctly set up in the EPP console to prevent connectivity issues.
- Always check for recent changes in network configurations or security solutions that may affect connectivity.
