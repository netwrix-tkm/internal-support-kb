## Problem Description
The customer reported that their two on-premises servers required renewal of their admin portal certificates, which were set to expire on March 23, 2025. They inquired about the process for applying the new certificates issued by their external Certificate Authority (CA) and whether SSH access was necessary for the renewal.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to renew the server certificates before their expiration date. The customer was unsure of the renewal process and whether SSH access was required.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed instructions for updating the server certificates through the Endpoint Protector UI. The customer successfully followed the steps and confirmed that the update was successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the certificate expiration dates well in advance to avoid service interruptions.
- Document the steps for updating server certificates clearly in the knowledge base for future reference.
- No SSH access is required for certificate renewal when using the UI method.
