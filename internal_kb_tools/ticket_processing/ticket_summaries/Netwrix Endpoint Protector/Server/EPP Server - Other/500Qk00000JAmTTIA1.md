## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JAmTTIA1
- **Case Number:** 429086
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ING companies
- **Contact Name:** Drake Scott
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Appliance Web Service
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in modifying the EPP appliance's nginx configuration to enable the web service to operate with only one network interface card (NIC), as their internal architecture only supports one virtual NIC on a virtual machine (VM).

## Environment Details
- The customer operates a virtual machine environment with a single virtual NIC.
- The EPP appliance is expected to function with standard configurations that typically require multiple NICs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's requirement for a single NIC configuration.
2. Engaged with R&D to explore potential short-term solutions.
3. Created a feature request to address the need for a permanent solution.
4. Discussed the implications of modifying the nginx configuration with the DevOps team.
5. Scheduled a remote session to implement the temporary changes.

## Root Cause
The EPP appliance's default configuration requires multiple NICs for the web service to function correctly. The customer's specific environment constraints necessitated a modification to this standard setup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Implementing a temporary modification to the nginx configuration to allow the web service to start with a single NIC.
- A feature request was created for a more permanent solution to accommodate environments with only one NIC.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the temporary modification may break if the customer changes networking settings or regenerates certificates. A permanent solution through the feature request process is recommended for long-term stability.
- Future support cases involving similar requests should reference this case for guidance on handling single NIC configurations.
