## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O8bW4IAJ
- **Case Number:** 442341
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chevron Phillips Chemical
- **Contact Name:** Jeff Schemp
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while replacing a TLS certificate on their server. After generating and uploading a new certificate along with the corresponding key, the certificate was installed without the accompanying root and issuing certificate authorities (CAs) that were part of the certificate chain. This resulted in an untrusted certificate error when accessing the site.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Server Type:** Not specified
- **Operating System:** Not specified

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to check various locations in the EPP UI for configuring and generating certificates:
   - Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Client Registration Certificate
   - Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Server Certificate
   - System Configuration -> System Settings -> Server Certificate Stack
   - System Configuration -> System Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection Certificate
2. A remote session was scheduled to assist the customer with the certificate import process.
3. The support engineer researched additional documentation and provided links for setting up certificates.
4. The customer confirmed that they could not find a location to upload the CA certificate chain.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the failure to properly upload the root CA and issuing CA certificates, which are necessary for establishing a complete certificate chain. The customer had pasted the entire certificate chain during the upload, but the server did not recognize or include the CA certificates, leading to the untrusted certificate error.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by replacing the certificate from the server's backend. The support engineer assisted the customer in ensuring that both the certificate and the necessary CA certificates were correctly imported into the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that all required CA certificates are uploaded along with the primary certificate to avoid untrusted certificate errors.
- It is advisable to verify the certificate chain after installation to confirm that all components are recognized by the server.
- Future cases involving TLS certificate replacements should include a checklist for verifying the presence of root and issuing CA certificates.
