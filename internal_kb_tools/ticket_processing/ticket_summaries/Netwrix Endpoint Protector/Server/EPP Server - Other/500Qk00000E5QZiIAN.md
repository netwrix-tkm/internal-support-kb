- **Contact Name:** Henrique Praxedes

- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested the addition of Client and Server time in UTC format to the Content Aware Report within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They emphasized the importance of using UTC for consistency in their detections and triages, as this information is already available in server/alert logs.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing Content Aware Report to confirm the absence of Client and Server time in UTC.
2. Verified that the required UTC time information is available in server/alert logs.
3. Engaged with R&D to discuss the feasibility of adding the requested feature.
4. Documented the feature request and linked it to the product roadmap.

## Root Cause
The absence of Client and Server time in UTC format in the Content Aware Report was due to it not being included as a feature in the current version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Solution
A feature request was officially opened and confirmed by R&D as part of the EPP Unify roadmap. The customer was informed that their request would be considered for future updates.
