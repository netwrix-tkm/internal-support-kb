## Problem Description
The client, UBI Financial Services, was unable to deliver daily CAP reports via email due to issues with SMTP settings, which did not generate test emails after configuration.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The SMTP settings were configured but resulted in bounce-back emails.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set up the SMTP option in the application.
2. Saved the settings with the option to send a test email.
3. Observed that the customer received a bounce-back email indicating that the ID did not match the "from" address.

## Root Cause
The bounce-back emails were caused by a mismatch between the user ID/email and the "from" address configured in the SMTP settings.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the user ID/email was copied correctly into the custom email settings, allowing the test email to be sent successfully without any bounce-backs.

## Notes
- Ensure that the "from" address in SMTP settings matches the user ID/email to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always test SMTP configurations after making changes to verify that emails can be sent successfully.
