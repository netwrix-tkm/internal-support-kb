- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to access the EPP server console on Hyper-V, receiving an error when attempting to connect via the server's IP address.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server was set up on a Hyper-V environment.
- Initially, only one network adapter was configured for the server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the server's network configuration.
2. Confirmed that the server UI was not accessible.
3. Checked the number of network adapters configured on the server.
4. Added a second network adapter to the server.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the configuration of the EPP server, which requires at least two network adapters to function correctly. The initial setup only included one adapter, which prevented access to the server console.

## Solution
After identifying that only one network adapter was configured, a second network adapter was added to the server. Once this was done, the console became accessible, resolving the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP server is configured with at least two network adapters during setup to avoid similar access issues in the future.
- Document any changes made to the server configuration for future reference.
