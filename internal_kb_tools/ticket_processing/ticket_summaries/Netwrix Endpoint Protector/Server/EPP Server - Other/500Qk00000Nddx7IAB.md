## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to log into the EPP (Endpoint Protector) console and requested a password reset for the account.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on-premises.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's availability for a remote session to reset the password.
2. Informed the customer that they would need to have Putty installed for SSH access to the server.
3. Scheduled a remote session for the password reset.
4. Attempted to connect for the password reset but the customer was late to the session.
5. Rescheduled the session for a later time.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a forgotten or incorrect password for the EPP console, preventing the customer from logging in.

## Solution
The password for the Root account was successfully reset from the backend, allowing the customer to regain access to the EPP console.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are reminded to be on time for scheduled sessions to avoid delays in resolution.
- It is advisable to confirm that the necessary tools (like Putty) are installed prior to the remote session to facilitate a smoother process.
- Future cases may benefit from a preliminary check of the customer's access credentials before scheduling remote sessions.
