## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, requested to increase the minimum password length requirement for the "Security Password for System Administrator" feature from 9 to 12 characters.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) platform, specifically the security settings for system administrator passwords.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The request was registered as a feature request on the Netwrix Product Board.
2. The support team escalated the ticket for further investigation.
3. It was confirmed that the functionality to set the minimum password length is already available in the web UI.
4. The relevant user manual was referenced to guide the customer on how to configure the password settings.

## Root Cause
The request for increasing the password length was unnecessary as the functionality to enforce a minimum password length was already available in the existing web UI settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that they could configure the minimum password length directly through the "Advanced User Password Settings" in the EPP web UI. The customer was directed to the user manual for detailed instructions on how to access and modify these settings.

## Notes
- Future feature requests should be raised only in the Product Boards.
- Customers should be encouraged to utilize existing functionalities before submitting feature requests.
- For any changes in security settings, always refer to the latest user manual for guidance.
