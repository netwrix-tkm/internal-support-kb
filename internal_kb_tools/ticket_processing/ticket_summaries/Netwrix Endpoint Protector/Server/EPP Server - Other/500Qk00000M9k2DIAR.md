- **Case Number:** 436619
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Children's Medical Center of Dallas - Auditor
- **Contact Name:** WILLIAM LAU
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
After a migration, the customer reported that they could no longer download the Windows EPP client from the server.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The specific version of the software in use was 10.2.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified if the Windows agents were available in the software directory on the server (`/EPPServer/sieratool/web/software`).
2. Checked file permissions and ownership of the agents, ensuring they were set to `www-data:www-data` with permissions set to `755`.
3. Attempted to inject the missing agents on the server.
4. Executed the SQL query:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM clientsoftware WHERE isdefault = 1;
   ```
5. Engaged in communication with the engineering team for further assistance and clarification on the migration process.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the default client version not being set correctly after the migration, which prevented the download of the Windows EPP client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by setting the default client version to `6.2.4.2000` from the backend. After this adjustment, the customer was able to successfully download the Windows EPP client from the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that the default client version is correctly configured after any migration to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document the migration process and any custom agents used to facilitate troubleshooting in case of future issues.
