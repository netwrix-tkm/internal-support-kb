## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J1nF3IAJ
- **Case Number:** 428631
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IGOS GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Ivy Nguy
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer experienced difficulties while setting up the Endpoint Protector VM, specifically with the configuration window. Despite following the manual, they were unable to apply the network settings correctly, leading to an inability to access the application page.

## Environment Details
- Virtual Machine hosted on Hyper-V
- Manual network configuration attempted by the customer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer manually set the network access addresses from Hyper-V for the gateway and name server.
2. Customer verified that the specified IP address was within the valid range.
3. Attempted to apply the network settings, which resulted in the progress bar loading to 75% before returning to the main menu.
4. Customer tested the same IP addresses on an old Endpoint Protector server, confirming they were functional.
5. Support recommended checking the VM settings for the presence of two network devices.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an incorrect VLAN ID set in the VM settings for the network component "Ex." This misconfiguration prevented the application from being accessed under the specified IP address.

## Solution
The customer reviewed the network settings again and compared them with the old Endpoint Protector server. Upon discovering the incorrect VLAN ID, they corrected it in the VM settings. After making this adjustment, the configuration worked as per the manual, and the application became accessible.

## Notes
- Ensure that the VLAN ID is correctly configured when setting up network components in VMs to avoid similar access issues.
- It may be beneficial to verify the presence of multiple network devices in the VM settings if connectivity issues arise.
