- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Memorial Health Ohio
- **Contact Name:** Brian Goodman

- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer attempted to upgrade their server from version 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0. After the upgrade, the server failed to load the console login page, despite appearing to start normally. Additionally, when attempting to spin up a new appliance and restore from a backup, the customer encountered an error message stating "Request entity too large."

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Attempted Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the server startup process to confirm it was initiating correctly.
2. Attempted to restore from a backup on a newly spun-up appliance.
3. Encountered and noted the error message "Request entity too large" during the backup restoration attempt.
4. Investigated potential issues with network adapter settings.
5. Cleared space on the server to ensure sufficient resources for the upgrade.
6. Applied the 5.9.4.0 update again after addressing the identified issues.

## Root Cause
The initial failure to boot and load the console login page was attributed to a misconfiguration of the network adapter settings, which prevented proper communication. Additionally, insufficient disk space contributed to the inability to restore from the backup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Fixing the network adapter configuration to ensure proper connectivity.
2. Clearing unnecessary files to free up disk space.
3. Successfully applying the 5.9.4.0 update after addressing the above issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that network adapter settings are correctly configured before performing upgrades.
- Always verify that there is adequate disk space available to avoid issues during backup restoration.
- Monitor server logs for any errors during the upgrade process to identify potential issues early.
