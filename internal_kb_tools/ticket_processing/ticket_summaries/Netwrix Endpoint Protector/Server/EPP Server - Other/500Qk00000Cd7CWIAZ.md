- **Feature:** Content Aware Logs

## Problem Description
The customer reported that no new entries were being recorded in their Content Aware Report since applying a hotfix on June 27, 2024. Reapplying the hotfix did not resolve the issue.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to reapply the hotfix (adv-2024-002) without success.
2. Netwrix support acknowledged the issue and communicated that the hotfix may have caused the system to stop processing certain events.
3. Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the problematic hotfix until a revised version could be made available.
4. A new hotfix was developed and communicated to the customer for application.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known problem following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1, which caused the system to cease processing certain events, including updates to the Content Aware Logs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a new hotfix that replaced the problematic one. The customer confirmed that after applying the new hotfix, the Content Aware Logs began updating correctly.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues after applying Hotfix #1 should contact Netwrix support for assistance.
- It is advisable to monitor the functionality of the system after applying any hotfix and to keep track of any known issues communicated by Netwrix.
