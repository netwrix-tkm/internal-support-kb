## Problem Description
The customer reported that the site was not loading and encountered a "500 Internal Server Error" message, indicating that something was broken on the server.

## Environment Details
- The server was running with a database size of approximately 46GB to 48GB during the troubleshooting process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
