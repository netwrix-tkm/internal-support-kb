## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D8A4LIAV
- **Case Number:** 415076
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 7.2.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that several Content Aware Protection policies were displayed with the status "in processing" and could not be modified or deleted in the console.

## Environment Details
- **Environment:** Production (PROD)
- **URL:** [Netwrix Endpoint Protector Console](https://ygh5qe0.unify.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue was reproducible in the production environment.
2. Engaged the QA team to verify if the issue was known and if a fix was in progress.
3. Noted that the issue was identified as a bug and was scheduled to be fixed in version 7.2.0.
4. Followed up with the customer regarding the application of version 7.2.0 in production.
5. After the patch was applied, the customer reported that the issue persisted for certain policies.
6. Investigated whether the policies that could not be modified were created before the patch was applied.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a bug in the system that affected policies created before the application of the 7.2.0 patch. These policies remained in the "in processing" state and could not be edited or deleted through the user interface.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying a manual fix from the engineering team after the customer confirmed that the policies were still grayed out and unmodifiable even after the patch. The engineering team provided a backend solution to delete the problematic policies, which allowed the customer to regain control over their Content Aware Protection policies.

## Notes
- Policies created before the 7.2.0 patch may remain unmodifiable if they are in the "in processing" state.
- For future cases, if similar issues arise, it may be necessary to delete affected policies directly from the backend if they cannot be modified through the UI.
- Always confirm with the customer after applying patches to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
