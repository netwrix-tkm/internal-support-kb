- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Savills Investment Management (Germany) GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Werner Kessel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space, with only 6.8 GB free out of 19.52 GB (approximately 35% remaining). This low disk space could severely affect the functionality and performance of the EPP Server.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on the Netwrix end.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the disk space usage on the appliance.
2. Suggested the customer use the Audit Log Backup feature to reduce the logs stored in the database.
3. Recommended deleting older system and audit log backups.
4. Advised tuning policies to reduce the incoming log count.
5. Gathered access to the backend to clear disk usage.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by excessive log storage, which led to the depletion of available disk space on the appliance.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by accessing the backend and performing the following actions:
- Cleared unnecessary logs and backups.
- Implemented log management strategies, including the use of Audit Log Backup and deletion of older backups, to prevent future occurrences of low disk space.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space usage and implement log management practices to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Consider setting up alerts for low disk space to proactively manage storage before it impacts server performance.
