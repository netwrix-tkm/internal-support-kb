- **Case Number:** 438426
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AconSeg
- **Contact Name:** Mariano Amigo
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a connectivity issue between the agent and server on a custom port. Although the server was reachable via ping, it was not responding on the specified custom port.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server and clients.
- The custom port configuration was not functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to diagnose the issue.
2. Verified network connectivity by pinging the server.
3. Attempted to connect the EPP clients to the server using the defined custom port.
4. Removed the Custom Client Certificate set on the UI.
5. Changed the port configuration on the client to the default port 443.
6. Uploaded the SSL certificate to the EPP server to ensure secure communication.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the presence of a Custom Client Certificate that was incorrectly configured, along with the use of a non-standard custom port that was not responding.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Removing the Custom Client Certificate from the UI.
- Changing the client port configuration to the standard port 443.
- Uploading the SSL certificate to the EPP server, which secured the connection.
After these changes, both EPP clients successfully connected to the EPP server.

## Notes
- Ensure that any custom certificates are properly configured before deployment.
- It is advisable to use standard ports (like 443) for better compatibility and ease of troubleshooting.
- Always verify SSL certificate installation on the server to maintain secure connections.
