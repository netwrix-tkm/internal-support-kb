- **Case Number:** 434863
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Secure Gate (@securegate.com.br)
- **Contact Name:** Tiago Guerra
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to delete multiple computers marked as "unlicensed," "offline," or "duplicate" from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. Despite receiving a confirmation message that the deletion had started, the computers remained in the system.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed when attempting to delete more than 10 computers at a time.
- The customer was able to delete individual computers or groups of 9 or fewer without issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered permission from the customer to access the backend.
2. Checked the permissions and ownership of the directory `/var/eppfiles/entities_to_be_deleted`.
3. Verified the database parameter `limit_select_all_action` which was initially set to 10.
4. Attempted to delete computers using various methods (selecting all, selecting 10+, etc.).
5. Conducted remote sessions to gather more information and test deletion functionality.
6. Updated the `limit_select_all_action` parameter to 1000 in the database.
7. Changed the permissions of the directory to `755` and set the owner to `www-data`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a configuration limitation in the system where the parameter `limit_select_all_action` was set to 10, preventing the deletion of more than 10 computers at a time. Additionally, incorrect permissions on the deletion directory may have contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Updating the `limit_select_all_action` parameter in the database to 1000, allowing the deletion of larger groups of computers.
2. Ensuring the directory `/var/eppfiles/entities_to_be_deleted` had the correct permissions (`755`) and ownership (`www-data`).

After these changes, the customer was able to delete more than 10 computers at a time without issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `limit_select_all_action` parameter is set appropriately for customer needs to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify directory permissions and ownership when encountering deletion issues.
- Document any changes made to the system configuration for future reference.
