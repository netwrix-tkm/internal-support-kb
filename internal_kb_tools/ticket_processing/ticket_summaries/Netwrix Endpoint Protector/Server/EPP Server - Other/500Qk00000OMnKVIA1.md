- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Arista Networks, Inc.

- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue after procuring 250 additional licenses for their existing endpoint license (#115140). Upon uploading the new license file, the total number of licenses reflected was only 750, instead of the expected 5,250 licenses. This discrepancy resulted in several endpoints being unlicensed, adversely affecting the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Existing License Count:** 5,000 licenses prior to the new purchase.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer uploaded the new license file but observed an incorrect total of 750 licenses.
2. Support team checked internally for the cause of the discrepancy.
3. Customer was advised to re-import the previous license file for 5,000 computers to temporarily cover their needs.
4. Support team coordinated with the fulfillment team to issue a new license file.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a problem with the new license file that was issued, which did not correctly reflect the total number of licenses after the additional purchase.

## Solution
Sales issued a new license file that correctly reflected the total of 5,250 licenses. The customer confirmed that they were able to import this new license file without any issues, resolving the licensing discrepancy.

## Notes
- Ensure that any new license files issued are thoroughly checked for accuracy before being sent to customers to prevent similar issues.
- Customers should be advised to keep a backup of previous license files in case of discrepancies during new imports.
