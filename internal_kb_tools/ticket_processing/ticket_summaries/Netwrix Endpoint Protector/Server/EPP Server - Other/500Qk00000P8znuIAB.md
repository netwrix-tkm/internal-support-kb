## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P8znuIAB
- **Case Number:** 445041
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Aspex Management
- **Contact Name:** Thomas Wong
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** None
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in understanding the traffic generated by the BypassApp, which they suspected was related to their web filtering applications. They were concerned that excluding this traffic would hinder their ability to track staff file uploads.

## Environment Details
- **Endpoint Protector Host:** Provided by Netwrix
- **Server ID:** 49XMNYFY
- **Issue Type:** Outdated Product Version
- **Reported Symptoms:** Overwhelming amount of DPI bypass event logs under "Report and Analysis" > "Content Aware Report".

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to observe the customer's configuration.
2. Verified that the Endpoint Protector (EPP) was still enforcing the Content Aware Policy (CAP) despite the DPI Bypass being enabled.
3. Guided the customer to disable the "DPI Bypass Event Logging" setting to reduce log noise.
4. Instructed the customer to test the same settings on other endpoints.

## Root Cause
The overwhelming DPI bypass event logs were due to the logging settings being enabled, which created excessive noise in the reports. However, the EPP was functioning correctly and enforcing policies as expected.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Disabling the "DPI Bypass Event Logging" setting during the remote session, which significantly reduced the number of unnecessary logs.
- The customer subsequently upgraded the EPP client, which confirmed that the EPP continued to work as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the logging settings in EPP to avoid excessive log generation, which can obscure important events.
- Customers should be advised to keep their EPP client updated to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
