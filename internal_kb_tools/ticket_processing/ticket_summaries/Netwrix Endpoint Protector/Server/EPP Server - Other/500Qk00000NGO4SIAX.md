## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in setting up a new wildcard SSL certificate on their server. After applying the certificate, they encountered issues with backend upgrades not applying.

## Environment Details
- **Client Version:** 6.2.4.2
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Hosting Platform:** On-Prem

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Request:** Customer requested a remote support session to install the new certificate.
2. **Certificate Installation:** Provided instructions to log into the web console, navigate to Appliance -> Server Maintenance, and paste the new certificate and secret key.
3. **Verification:** Advised the customer to wait 5-10 minutes for the certificate to be applied and to reload the console.
4. **Backend Upgrade Issue:** After applying the certificate, the customer reported that backend upgrades were not applying.
5. **Remote Session:** Conducted a remote session to troubleshoot the backend upgrade issue.
6. **Reboot Attempt:** Suggested the customer reboot the VM to resolve potential issues with the boot partition.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was related to the application of the new SSL certificate. After successfully applying the certificate, the backend upgrade issue was likely due to a partially filled boot partition or configuration settings that needed adjustment.

## Solution
- Successfully applied the new wildcard SSL certificate as per the provided instructions.
- Resolved the backend upgrade issue during the remote session by addressing the configuration settings and ensuring the server was properly rebooted.

## Notes
- Ensure that the server is rebooted after applying significant changes like SSL certificates to avoid issues with backend upgrades.
- Always verify that the server has sufficient resources and that the boot partition is not filled to prevent similar issues in the future.
