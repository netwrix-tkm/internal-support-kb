## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cgz8GIAR
- **Case Number:** 414138
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Samsung - SRI Bangalore
- **Contact Name:** Christeen Das Fernandez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer requested SSH root access to the backend of the EPP Server (Ubuntu) to manage storage effectively and perform archiving tasks, which were hindered due to the unavailability of SSH access.

## Environment Details
- **Server OS:** Ubuntu
- **Product in Use:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was asked to provide details on the necessity of SSH access.
2. Confirmed that SSH access was essential for managing storage and performing archiving tasks.
3. Identified that the lack of SSH access led to difficulties in managing the storage component, especially when disk capacity was overloaded.
4. Conducted a remote session to create root credentials for the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the unavailability of SSH access, which prevented the customer from managing the storage effectively on the EPP Server. This limitation became critical when the disk capacity was overloaded, leading to difficulties in logging into the console.

## Solution
Root credentials were successfully created for the customer during a remote session, granting them the necessary SSH access to manage their EPP Server effectively. This resolved the issue, allowing the customer to perform required archiving tasks and manage the server efficiently.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers understand the importance of SSH access for server management, especially in environments where storage capacity is a concern.
- Consider documenting the process for granting SSH access to streamline future requests and reduce resolution time.
