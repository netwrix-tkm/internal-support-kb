## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OLy1lIAD
- **Case Number:** 442862
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Cloud Mail Store Inc / Cyberspace Networking Systems
- **Contact Name:** Pankaj Pandit
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Content Aware Protection (CAP)
- **Version:** Server: 5.9.4.1, Client: 3.0.4.1 / 6.2.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Content Aware Protection (CAP) policy, which previously restricted file uploads to all websites except those on an allowlist, was no longer functioning as expected. This issue arose after an upgrade to the latest server and client versions.

## Environment Details
- **DLP Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Versions:** 
  - Windows: 6.2.4.2
  - Mac: 3.0.4.1
- **Operating Systems:** Both Windows and Mac
- **Security Software:** Sophos Endpoint Defense installed

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue was present on both Windows and Mac clients.
2. Conducted a remote session to check settings and behavior.
3. Tested the CAP policy on Chrome by attempting to upload files to non-whitelisted sites (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive).
4. Collected logs during the upload attempts.
5. Noted that the Sophos Endpoint Defense might be interfering with the CAP policy.
6. Provided the customer with a list of EPP processes to whitelist in Sophos.
7. Scheduled follow-up remote sessions to further investigate.
8. Tested with Sophos disabled and Intercept VPN turned off, but the issue persisted.
9. Sent test builds for both Windows and Mac clients to the customer for testing.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by interference from the Sophos Endpoint Defense software, which was preventing the CAP policy from functioning correctly. Additionally, the problem persisted even after uninstalling Sophos on one MacBook, indicating a potential issue with the CAP policy itself or its configuration.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
1. Whitelisting specific EPP processes in Sophos, including:
   - `EPPservice.exe`
   - `sslsplit.exe`
   - `cssguard.exe`
   - `EPPNotifier.exe`
2. The customer was advised to create an allowlist for websites where uploads should be permitted and to add it to the policy instead of using monitored categories.
3. After implementing these changes, the customer confirmed that the CAP policy worked correctly on a test policy created for a single user on macOS. They were advised to replicate this for Windows.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any security software installed on client machines does not interfere with the functionality of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- Future customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to check for any third-party security software that may block or interfere with DLP policies.
- The customer should continue testing the Windows client with the provided test build and report back on its functionality.
