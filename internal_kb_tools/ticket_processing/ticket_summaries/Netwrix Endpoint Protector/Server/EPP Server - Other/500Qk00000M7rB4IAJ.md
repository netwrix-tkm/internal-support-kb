## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M7rB4IAJ
- **Case Number:** 436518
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ACI Worldwide US
- **Contact Name:** Adam Davis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they needed to open port 22 on their Netwrix box (IP: 10.92.2.153) to enable communication with their inventory management tool located at IP: 10.92.2.139.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Box IP:** 10.92.2.153
- **Inventory Management Tool IP:** 10.92.2.139

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer requested to open port 22 for communication.
2. Followed up with the customer regarding the creation of a service account.
3. Checked with DevOps to determine if the service account could be created or if a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) was necessary.
4. Asked the customer if they agreed to sign the NDA for the secondary account.
5. Followed up multiple times to confirm the customer's agreement to the NDA.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to create a service account for the customer to use the Azure agent on the EPP Server. The creation of this account required the customer to sign an NDA, which they were unwilling to do.

## Solution
The ticket was resolved by closing it after the customer declined to sign the NDA necessary for creating the service account. As a result, the request to open port 22 was not fulfilled.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are informed about the NDA requirements for creating service accounts in future cases.
- Consider alternative solutions if a customer is unwilling to sign an NDA, as this may impact their ability to utilize certain features.
