- **Case Number:** 436307
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Anatoli Lorenz
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 7.3.0 (scheduled fix)

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue when attempting to download an exported list of groups from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The following error messages were displayed:
- "An error occurred!"
- "The requested file does not exist."

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered in the production environment of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer followed the steps to reproduce the issue:
   - Selected "Device Control" and then "Groups."
   - Checked one or multiple groups.
   - Clicked "Choose action."
   - Clicked "Export List of Groups."
2. Confirmed that the issue was a known bug, already registered internally.
3. A session was initiated with the engineering team to investigate the backend.
4. The customer was informed about the known bug and the upcoming fix in version 7.3.0.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a configuration problem on the server. Specifically, the directory `/var/eppfiles/mysql-files` was missing, which prevented the system from generating exported entities.

## Solution
The engineering team created the missing directory and configured MySQL to ensure it could write to that location. After implementing this fix, the customer was asked to test the export functionality again, which confirmed that the issue was resolved. The customer reported successful downloads in both the production and development environments.

## Notes
- This issue was a known bug and is scheduled to be fixed in the 7.3.0 release.
- Ensure that the necessary directories and permissions are set up correctly on the server to avoid similar issues in the future.
