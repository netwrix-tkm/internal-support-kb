## Problem Description
The customer reported a time difference issue, suspecting that the NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization was not functioning properly.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the NTP configuration settings on the server.
2. Checked the server's time zone settings to ensure they were correctly set.
3. Monitored NTP synchronization status to identify any discrepancies.
4. Restarted the NTP service to see if it would resolve the synchronization issue.
5. Reviewed system logs for any errors related to time synchronization.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the NTP settings, which led to improper time synchronization across the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correcting the NTP configuration settings on the server. After making the necessary adjustments, the time synchronization functioned correctly, eliminating the observed time difference.

## Notes
- Ensure that NTP settings are regularly reviewed and validated to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to monitor the synchronization status periodically, especially after any system updates or changes to the network configuration.
