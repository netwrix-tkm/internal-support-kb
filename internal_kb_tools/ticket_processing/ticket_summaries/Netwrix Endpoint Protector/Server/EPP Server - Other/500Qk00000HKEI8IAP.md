## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the possibility of configuring a trusted SSL certificate on their server, which was currently using a self-signed certificate that was not trusted. They specifically asked if they could use their own wildcard certificate.

## Environment Details
- The server was running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The existing SSL certificate was self-signed.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request regarding SSL certificate configuration.
2. Confirmed the current use of a self-signed certificate on the server.
3. Provided information on the use of wildcard certificates and their compatibility with the server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the use of a self-signed SSL certificate, which is inherently not trusted by clients and browsers. The customer needed a way to implement a trusted SSL certificate.

## Solution
The resolution involved providing the customer with the necessary information to configure their own wildcard SSL certificate on the server. This would replace the self-signed certificate and establish a trusted connection.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any SSL certificates used are properly signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to avoid trust issues.
- Customers should be advised to regularly check and renew their SSL certificates to maintain secure connections.
