## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O3HeTIAV
- **Case Number:** 442027
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston
- **Contact Name:** Joseph Valle
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Reporting
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested a method to audit which machines have been explicitly allowed access to USB Storage Devices, as they could not find a report in the portal that provided this information.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for a report on machines with USB Storage Device access rights set to "Allow."
2. Confirmed that no direct report exists in the portal for this specific query.
3. Provided a workaround to generate an Effective Rights report for USB Storage Devices.

## Root Cause
The absence of a direct report in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector portal that lists machines with USB Storage Device access rights set to "Allow" was the primary cause of the customer's issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to create an Effective Rights report. The steps provided were:
- Navigate to **Dashboard** -> **Effective Rights**.
- Select **USB Storage Devices** as the device type.
- This report will display all computers and their respective rights for USB Storage Devices, including specific devices that are allowed.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that while there is no direct report for USB Storage Device access rights, the Effective Rights report serves as a viable workaround.
- Future requests for similar audits should be directed towards generating Effective Rights reports for the relevant device types.
