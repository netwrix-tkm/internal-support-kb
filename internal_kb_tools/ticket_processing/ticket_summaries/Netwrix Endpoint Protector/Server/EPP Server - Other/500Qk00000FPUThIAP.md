- **Case Number:** 420251
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IPSteel Reseller Account
- **Contact Name:** Luc Vantroost
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5.2.0.7

## Problem Description
The customer, a naval group using Endpoint Protector (EPP) for military boat and submarine construction, reported an issue with accessing the Web management interface after modifying the BIOS date of their equipment to 01/01/2040. Following this change, they encountered a "500 Internal Server Error" when attempting to access the interface.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Version:** 5.2.0.7
- **Host OS:** Windows Server 2008
- **Client OS:** Windows XP PosReady
- **Modification:** BIOS date set to 01/01/2040
- **License Status:** EPP license not activated during testing

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the BIOS date modification and its impact on system functionality.
2. Attempted to access the Web management interface to confirm the error message.
3. Checked for any expired certificates that could affect system operations.
4. Reviewed EPP documentation for information on certificate usage and potential impacts of date changes.

## Root Cause
The modification of the BIOS date to a future date (01/01/2040) caused the EPP system to encounter issues with certificate validation and internal server processes, leading to the "500 Internal Server Error." The EPP system relies on Windows certificates, which may have expiration dates that were affected by the date change.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the BIOS date to the current date, which restored normal functionality to the EPP system. The customer was advised to ensure that all software installations and certificates are valid and not expired, especially when planning for future operational timelines.

## Notes
- It is crucial to avoid modifying system dates significantly, as this can lead to unexpected errors and system malfunctions.
- Customers should ensure that all licenses are activated and certificates are valid to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regular checks on certificate expiration and system updates are recommended to maintain operational integrity.
