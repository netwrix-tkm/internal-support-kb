## Problem Description
The customer reported losing access to their server after upgrading to a new server. They requested to restore their previous login capabilities to install antivirus software on the new server.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after the customer upgraded their infrastructure by building a new server.
- The customer had previously filled out a form to gain access to the old server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the customer's request and initiated an internal investigation.
2. Inquired if the customer had applied the offline patch after installing the new machine.
3. Informed the customer that any third-party application installation must be performed by them, as per the signed disclaimer.
4. Scheduled a remote session to assist the customer with restoring access.
5. Transferred the case to another support engineer for further assistance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer's loss of access credentials during the server upgrade process. The new server setup did not automatically transfer the previous access rights.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the necessary access credentials for the new server. This allowed them to regain the login capabilities they had on the previous server.

## Notes
- Customers should ensure that all necessary patches and updates are applied after server upgrades to avoid access issues.
- It is important for customers to understand that installation of third-party applications on the EPP server must be conducted by them, following the guidelines provided during credential issuance.
