## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BVK90IAH
- **Case Number:** 411166
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston
- **Contact Name:** Joseph Valle
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 19.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on properly shutting down an old on-premise server before decommissioning it. They were unsure whether a proper shutdown was necessary or if a hard shutdown would suffice.

## Environment Details
- The server in question is part of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector setup.
- There are approximately 10+ computers that still communicate with the EPP server but cannot be located.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to discuss the shutdown process.
2. Conducted a remote session with the customer to review the server's communication status and the necessary steps for decommissioning.
3. Set up User Remediation for USB devices with a custom notification to manage device control during the transition.
4. Confirmed that the EPP server would be shut down from the customer's end in about 7 days.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity on the shutdown process for the old server, particularly regarding the implications of a hard shutdown versus a proper shutdown.

## Solution
The customer was advised to perform a proper shutdown of the server to ensure that all processes were terminated correctly and to avoid potential data loss or corruption. The remote session provided the necessary guidance, and the customer confirmed they would proceed with the shutdown as discussed.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all devices communicating with the EPP server are accounted for before proceeding with a shutdown.
- Future decommissioning processes should include a review of all connected devices to prevent unexpected issues.
- The ticket was left open for one week post-session to address any further questions from the customer.
