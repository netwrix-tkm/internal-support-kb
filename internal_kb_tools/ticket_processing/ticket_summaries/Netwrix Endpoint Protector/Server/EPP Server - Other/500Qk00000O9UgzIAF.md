- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O9UgzIAF
- **Case Number:** 442397
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix
- **Contact Name:** Andreas Ster
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5942

## Problem Description
The customer, BMW China, reported an issue where the Active Directory (AD) structure was not being retrieved or displayed during synchronization, despite a successful connection. Multiple users and domain controllers were tested without success.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5942
- **Connection Port:** 389 (LDAP)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed successful connection to the AD server.
2. Attempted synchronization with multiple user accounts and domain controllers.
3. Checked firewall settings, noting that SSH access was blocked but expected to be resolved shortly.
4. Engaged R&D for further investigation and guidance.
5. Reviewed history logs of the AD sync job.
6. Ensured the LDAP user account had read access to the relevant parts of Active Directory.
7. Suggested the customer review their firewall configuration.
8. Adjusted the base search path for the sync job multiple times without success.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect base search path for the synchronization. The customer was attempting to sync a specific Organizational Unit (OU) that contained only computers, which did not yield any results in the Directory Browser.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. The customer was instructed to modify the base search path by removing the specific OU (OU=ML_Laptops) and selecting the parent level instead.
2. The customer then re-added the ML_Laptops OU from the list of available OUs.
3. After confirming the full path of the OU was correctly listed in the sync settings, the customer was advised to wait for the next sync interval to complete.

## Notes
- Ensure that the base search path is correctly configured to include the appropriate level of the directory structure to retrieve entities.
- Future cases should verify the permissions of the LDAP user account and the firewall settings, even if initial connectivity tests are successful.
- It is important to communicate clearly with the customer about the structure of their AD and the implications of syncing specific OUs.
