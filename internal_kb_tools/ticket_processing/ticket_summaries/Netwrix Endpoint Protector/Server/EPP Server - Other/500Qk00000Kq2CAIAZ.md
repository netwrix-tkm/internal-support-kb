- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the group "EPP-Domänencomputer" was missing from the EPP configuration, which is essential for all DEFAULT-DENY CAP policies. The reference to the Active Directory (AD) group was suddenly absent, and the customer could not find the appropriate configuration.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after running an AD sync, which did not include all users from the AD group.
- The customer was using a test version of Baramundi and running the ZAP tool.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the AD sync to check if the group included all users.
2. Attempted to recreate the AD sync and re-add computers to the AD group.
3. Executed the installation command for the EPP client in silent mode to check for errors:
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /i "EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi" /qn /l*v "c:tempEPP_inst.log" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443
   ```
4. Investigated error logs for installation issues, particularly Error 1925 indicating insufficient privileges.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a missing reference to the AD group in the EPP configuration, which occurred after the AD sync was run. Additionally, installation errors were related to insufficient privileges when attempting to install the EPP client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Recreating the AD sync and ensuring that the computers were removed from the AD group and then added back again. This allowed the sync to work as expected, with the computers being correctly assigned to the group.
- The customer was advised to run the ZAP tool to clean up any remnants of previous installations, although it was noted that the tool did not remove all necessary registry keys, requiring manual intervention.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the user running the installation has sufficient privileges to avoid Error 1925.
- Future users should be aware that the ZAP tool may not completely remove all remnants of previous installations, and manual cleanup of registry keys may be necessary.
- The customer mentioned an ongoing issue with updating the EPP client version, which they planned to test further and report back.
