## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NwWf1IAF
- **Case Number:** 441709
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tech Elecon Pvt. Ltd. (Elecon Engineering Group)
- **Contact Name:** Mohit Shastri
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (EPP Server), 6.2.4.2 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading one client to version 6.2.4.2, the Endpoint Protector (EPP) system failed to inspect files (specifically DOCX and PDF files embedded in JPG images) for keywords added to the deny list. The customer was concerned that the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution was not blocking files containing sensitive content.

## Environment Details
- EPP Server version: 5.9.4.1
- EPP Client version: 6.2.4.2
- The issue was specifically related to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality, which was reported to be partially working.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's configuration and the deny list settings.
2. Investigated the previous ticket (ID 424813) referenced by the customer for additional context.
3. Confirmed the OCR functionality was partially operational in the upgraded client version.
4. Collected sample files from the customer for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known limitation in the OCR functionality of the EPP client version 6.2.4.2, which was not fully capable of inspecting embedded files for keywords as expected. A feature request (FR) had already been raised to address this limitation.

## Solution
The case was resolved by informing the customer that the issue was already recognized and documented in a feature request (FR) on the Netwrix product board. The customer was advised that they would be updated on the progress of the feature request and that this ticket would be closed as a duplicate of ticket ID 424813.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be directed to check for existing feature requests related to OCR functionality.
- It is important to keep track of feature requests and their statuses to provide timely updates to customers.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the limitations of the current versions of the software they are using, especially after upgrades.
