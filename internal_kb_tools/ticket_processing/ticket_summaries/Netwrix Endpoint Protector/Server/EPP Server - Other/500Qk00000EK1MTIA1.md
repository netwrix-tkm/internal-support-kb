- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EK1MTIA1
- **Case Number:** 417836
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sharecare
- **Contact Name:** Taylor Summers
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that EPP clients were not checking in with a newly migrated server, which had assumed the CNAME of the previous server. The server appeared unresponsive to client update requests on port 8443.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after migrating to a new server that took over the CNAME of the old server.
- The server was configured to use port 8443 for client updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the server's CNAME configuration.
2. Checked the server's responsiveness on port 8443.
3. Investigated the port separation settings to ensure they were correctly migrated.
4. Re-applied the port separation procedure to the new server.

## Root Cause
The port separation settings did not migrate correctly during the server transition, leading to the server's inability to respond to client update requests.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reapplying the port separation procedure on the new server, which restored the functionality of client updates on port 8443.

## Notes
- Ensure that port separation settings are properly migrated during future server migrations to avoid similar issues.
- Always verify server responsiveness on the configured update ports after migration.
