- **Case Number:** 445280
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Christian Spies
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that log reports created after May 10, 2025, were no longer visible in the Unify server console. They expected all log reports to be retrievable and displayed correctly.

## Environment Details
- The communication between the EPP client and server was confirmed to be functional.
- Logs were being stored in Redis but not processed due to memory threshold issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that logs created after May 10, 2025, were not displayed in the Unify server console.
2. Verified that communication between the EPP client and server was operational.
3. Investigated the Redis storage and found that logs were stored but not processed due to memory threshold being reached.
4. Identified that no logs were lost; they remained in Redis.
5. Analyzed memory usage and batch log processing limitations.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as excessive memory consumption by the Redis key scanning mechanism. This led to logs being stored but not processed or displayed due to memory thresholds being reached.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote support session by optimizing the Redis data search and processing logic. This adjustment reduced memory usage and improved efficiency, allowing all logs from May 10, 2025, onward to be visible in the Unify server console. The solution was confirmed during a follow-up session, and the environment will continue to be monitored for stability.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor memory usage and optimize batch processing to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check Redis configurations and thresholds to maintain optimal performance.
- Confirm with customers after resolution to ensure all expected logs are visible and accessible.
