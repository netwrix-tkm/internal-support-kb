## Problem Description
The customer reported intermittent issues with their server, including login failures and messages indicating that the RAM memory was full. The server is administered by Cososys.

## Environment Details
- **Server Administered By:** Cososys
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Assessed the overall server performance and resource allocation.
4. Engaged with the server administration team to discuss potential optimizations.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as suboptimal server performance due to insufficient RAM allocation, leading to full memory conditions that affected login capabilities.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by optimizing the server. This involved reallocating resources and possibly upgrading the RAM to ensure better performance and prevent memory-related issues in the future.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor server performance regularly to preemptively address potential memory issues.
- Consider implementing alerts for high memory usage to facilitate timely interventions.
- Future cases should include a review of server resource allocation as a standard troubleshooting step.
