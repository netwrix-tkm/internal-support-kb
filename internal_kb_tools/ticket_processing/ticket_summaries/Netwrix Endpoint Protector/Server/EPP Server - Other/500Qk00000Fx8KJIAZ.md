## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fx8KJIAZ
- **Case Number:** 421452
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Duane Morris LLP
- **Contact Name:** Andrew Singer
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer was unable to receive test messages when configuring an external SMTP server on their CoSoSys hosted instance. They inquired about necessary firewall rules and updated configuration guidance.

## Environment Details
- **Hosted Instance URL:** [CoSoSys Instance](https://35ylwgp.hosted.endpointprotector.com)
- **SMTP Server:** [SMTP Server](https://mx0a-00158602.pphosted.com) (IP: 67.231.149.12)
- **Required Port:** Outbound port 25

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the SMTP server was correctly configured.
2. Verified that both ports 25 and 587 were open for testing.
3. Identified that outbound connectivity from the hosted instance to the SMTP server was not functioning.
4. Requested the opening of port 25 from AWS to allow outbound SMTP traffic.
5. Engaged the security team to approve the request for port opening.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by AWS blocking outbound port 25, which is required for SMTP communication with the external server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully requesting AWS to open outbound port 25 for the customer's SMTP server. Once the port was opened, the test messages were successfully received.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future SMTP configurations consider the necessity of opening outbound port 25 on AWS instances.
- It is advisable to use a hostname instead of an IP address in SMTP configurations and to verify TLS settings if issues arise.
