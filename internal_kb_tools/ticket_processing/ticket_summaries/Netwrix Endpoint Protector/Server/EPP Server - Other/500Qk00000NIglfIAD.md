## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the compatibility of their system with VMware vCenter (VC) version 8 and whether they needed to upgrade their current version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- Current version of Endpoint Protector: 5.8.0.0
- Desired version of VMware ESXi: 8

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry received from the customer regarding compatibility with VMware VC version 8.
2. Clarification requested from the customer regarding the abbreviation "VC."
3. Customer confirmed that "VC" refers to VMware vCenter and provided additional details about the ESXi version.
4. Technical support confirmed that Netwrix Endpoint Protector supports VMware vSphere (ESXi) starting from version 6.0.0.
5. Customer asked if an upgrade of Endpoint Protector was necessary for compatibility with ESXi version 8.
6. Support advised that an upgrade of Endpoint Protector was not necessary but recommended upgrading to at least version 5.9.0.0 for optimal performance.

## Root Cause
The initial confusion stemmed from the abbreviation "VC," which was not immediately clear to the support team. Once clarified, it was confirmed that the existing version of Endpoint Protector was compatible with the desired VMware ESXi version.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the current version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (5.8.0.0) is compatible with VMware ESXi version 8. However, it was recommended to upgrade to version 5.9.0.0 or higher to benefit from the latest updates and improvements. The customer was also advised to take a snapshot of the EPP virtual appliance and ensure backups were in place before proceeding with any upgrades.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify abbreviations and technical terms with customers to avoid confusion.
- Always recommend taking backups and snapshots before performing upgrades to prevent data loss.
- Future inquiries regarding compatibility should reference the specific versions of both the software and the virtualization platform for accurate support.
