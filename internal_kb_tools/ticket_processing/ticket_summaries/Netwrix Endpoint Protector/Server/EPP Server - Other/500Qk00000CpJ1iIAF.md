## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CpJ1iIAF
- **Case Number:** 414452
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Naukri
- **Contact Name:** Vaneet Kumar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Virtual Image Resources Optimization
- **Version:** 5.8.1.0

## Problem Description
The Naukri team requested assistance with resource optimization for their newly installed Endpoint Protector (EPP) virtual image, which is being used across 1001 computers. They were unable to access the server via SSH and required root credentials to extend the external HDD configuration and install monitoring agents.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Version:** 5.8.1.0
- **Hosting Platform:** VMware
- **Total Computers:** 1001

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication was established to confirm the hosting platform and schedule a remote session.
2. The customer confirmed the use of VMware and requested a session to optimize the EPP server.
3. During the session, it was identified that SSH access was needed for backend configuration, but root credentials were not available to the customer.
4. The support team explained that SSH credentials are sensitive and can only be provided under a signed agreement.
5. The first EPP server was optimized for 8 CPU cores and 8GB RAM during the remote session.
6. The customer was instructed to allocate the same resources for the second server before the next session.

## Root Cause
The inability to access the server via SSH was due to the lack of root credentials, which are restricted to the Endpoint Protector support team for security reasons.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by optimizing the first EPP server during a scheduled remote session. The server was configured with the necessary resources (8 CPU cores, 8GB RAM) to support the 1000 endpoints. The customer was advised to prepare the second server with the same specifications for the next optimization session.

## Notes
- Future requests for SSH access must be accompanied by a signed agreement to ensure compliance with security protocols.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the resource requirements for their EPP servers to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Follow up with the customer after optimization to confirm that all systems are functioning as expected.
