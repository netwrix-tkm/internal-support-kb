## Problem Description
The customer, Vedran Salamun from ReversingLabs, requested assistance with exporting all data from their Endpoint Protector (EPP) server due to the end of their contract. They inquired about the possibility of obtaining a database export in a readable format.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the support request and confirmed receipt of the ticket.
2. Provided information on two methods for exporting data:
   - **Audit Log Backup**: Instructed the customer to navigate to System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup in the EPP UI to set up log archives for local download.
   - **SIEM Integration**: Suggested configuring SIEM integration (e.g., with Splunk) via Appliance -> SIEM Integration to export logs directly to their SIEM system.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for a comprehensive data export due to the expiration of their contract, which required clarification on the available export methods within the EPP system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing clear instructions on how to utilize the Audit Log Backup functionality and the SIEM integration feature to export the necessary data. The customer was able to follow these steps to successfully obtain their data.

## Notes
- Customers should be advised to initiate export requests well in advance of contract expiration to ensure they have sufficient time to retrieve all necessary data.
- It is important to confirm the format and method of export that best suits the customer's needs, as different methods may yield different formats and accessibility.
