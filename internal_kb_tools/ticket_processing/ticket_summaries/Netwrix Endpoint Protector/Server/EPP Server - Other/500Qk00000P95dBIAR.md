## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were not receiving email alerts from their EPP server for the Device Control and Content Aware Report.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the configuration of the EPP server's email alert system.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that test emails were being received successfully.
2. Reviewed the configuration of alerts and checked the last sent and received alerts.
3. Cleared the mailer from the backend of the EPP server and restarted the services.
4. Stopped the services from the backend of the server.
5. Cleared unprocessed logs and alerts that were not sent.
6. Investigated the folders responsible for the temporary cache and found they were not correctly created.
7. Recreated the necessary cache folders.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrectly created folders responsible for the temporary cache, which prevented the email alerts from being sent.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by recreating the cache folders for the email alerts during a remote session. This allowed the EPP server to properly process and send the email alerts.

## Notes
- It is recommended to configure alerts more granularly in the future to ensure that email alerts are sent for specific computers or events that need closer monitoring.
- Regular checks on the configuration and status of the EPP server's email alert system can help prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
