## Problem Description
The customer reported that their DLP console was showing low disk space. Despite attempts to increase the disk space, the changes were not reflecting in the console.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5940

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Customer provided a screenshot showing the low disk space warning.
3. Support team reviewed the disk space settings and configurations.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, it was likely related to the disk space allocation not being properly updated or reflected in the DLP console after the increase was attempted.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after confirming with the customer that the disk space was functioning correctly. It is implied that the disk space allocation was eventually recognized by the DLP console, allowing normal operations to resume.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to disk space allocations are properly reflected in the DLP console.
- If similar issues arise, verify that the disk space settings have been applied correctly and check for any potential delays in the system recognizing these changes.
