## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Jg7IHIAZ
- **Case Number:** 430283
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alpha Mechanical Service, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Chris Rhodes
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to modify SMTP settings after a migration. Additionally, an error indicated that the phone number was not defined for the admin, preventing any modifications to the phone number.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of Case:** 4.8 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message related to the admin phone number not being defined.
2. Attempted to modify the SMTP settings and the admin phone number.
3. Investigated backend optimizations due to recurring error 500 or service unavailability.
4. Removed brackets and minus signs from the admin phone number field.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the format of the admin phone number, which included brackets and minus signs. This formatting prevented the settings from being saved correctly.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Removing the brackets and minus signs from the admin phone number on the settings page.
- After the formatting was corrected, the settings were successfully saved, and the customer was able to receive test emails.
- Additional backend optimizations were performed to address the UI errors and improve performance, particularly regarding resource allocation on the EPP server.

## Notes
- If additional computers or modules are added in the future, it may be necessary to allocate more resources to maintain optimal performance.
- Ensure that phone numbers are entered in a format without special characters to avoid similar issues in the future.
