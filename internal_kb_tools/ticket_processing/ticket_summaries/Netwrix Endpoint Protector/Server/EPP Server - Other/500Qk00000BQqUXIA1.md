## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BQqUXIA1
- **Case Number:** 410958
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Boston College
- **Contact Name:** Pat Cain
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 8.3

## Problem Description
The customer requested to change the GUI login port from 443 to a different port (e.g., 444) to enhance security by not exposing the admin login GUI to the internet.

## Environment Details
- The customer has EPP-protected clients both on-campus and off-campus.
- The on-prem server requires port 443 to be open for communication with off-campus units.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that changing the GUI port is possible but requires a remote session.
2. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to perform the port change.
3. Discussed the need for SSH access to change the port, which was not available due to security policies.
4. Explored options for the customer to allow temporary access for the remote session.
5. Provided the customer with the IP address of the support engineer for firewall configuration.

## Root Cause
The inability to change the GUI port was primarily due to the lack of SSH access to the EPP Server backend, which is restricted for security reasons.

## Solution
- A remote session was successfully conducted where the GUI port was changed from 443 to the specified alternative port.
- The customer was informed about the successful completion of the port change.

## Notes
- The customer should ensure that the new port is properly configured in their firewall settings to allow access.
- Future requests for similar changes may require a review of security policies regarding SSH access and firewall rules.
- It is advisable to conduct a security analysis before opening any ports to the internet.
