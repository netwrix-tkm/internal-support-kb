- **Case Number:** 438682
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tony Blair Institute for Global Change
- **Contact Name:** Pete Chung
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Endpoint Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported that several computers were showing as licensed but were offline. These computers had previously been used in a Proof of Concept (PoC) but no longer had the Endpoint Protector client installed. Despite being offline, they were still counted as licensed, which raised concerns about license utilization.

## Environment Details
- The computers in question were part of a PoC and had the Endpoint Protector client removed after the PoC concluded.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the license status in the System Configuration under System Licensing.
2. Advised the customer to check if the offline computers were listed in the license view.
3. Suggested removing the licenses from the offline computers if they were not listed.
4. Recommended deleting the offline computers from Device Control if necessary.
5. Discussed the option of setting up Automatic License Release for future management of licenses.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the computers being removed from the network and the Endpoint Protector client being uninstalled, yet they remained in the licensing system as licensed devices. This discrepancy occurred because the licensing system did not automatically update to reflect the removal of the client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to:
- Remove the licenses from the offline computers using the red button in the licensing interface.
- Delete the offline computers from the Device Control section to ensure they no longer appeared in the system.
- It was also recommended to set up Automatic License Release to manage licenses for devices that have been offline for a specified period.

## Notes
- It is not necessary to delete the computers from the Device Control if the licenses are removed; however, starting fresh by deleting them is advisable for clarity.
- Setting up Automatic License Release can help prevent similar issues in the future by automatically managing licenses for devices that are no longer active.
