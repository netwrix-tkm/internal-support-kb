- **Case Number:** 434074
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Queensland Treasury
- **Contact Name:** Finn Ruth-Duffy
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server - Other
- **Feature:** Device Control
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Endpoint Protector licensing status. They observed that while there were 1356 online licenses, only 200 licenses were visible when accessing the "View Licenses" or "Device Control > Computers" sections, even after selecting to view all licenses.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the number of online licenses displayed in the Licensing Status.
2. Attempted to view licenses through "View Licenses" and "Device Control > Computers."
3. Checked for any filters that might limit the displayed licenses.
4. Investigated potential issues related to the version 5.9.4.0 of the software.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a setting in the "Device Control > Global Settings" section called "Display settings," which limited the number of licenses displayed to the user.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the "Display settings" in the "Device Control > Global Settings" to ensure that all licenses could be viewed. This change allowed the customer to see the full count of licenses available.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the "Display settings" option in the Global Settings, as it can affect the visibility of licenses.
- Recommend checking these settings if similar issues arise in the future regarding license visibility.
