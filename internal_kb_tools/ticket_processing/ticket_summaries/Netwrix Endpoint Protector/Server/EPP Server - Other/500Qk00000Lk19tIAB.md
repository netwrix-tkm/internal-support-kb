## Problem Description
The customer reported a discrepancy between the "Computers" list and the "View License" list in the System Licensing. Specifically, computers were marked as "Licensed" and offline in the "Computers" list, but no licenses were occupied by those computers in the license list. The total count of licensed computers exceeded the number of licenses occupied.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- The affected computers were primarily offline for an extended period.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the status of computers in the "Computers" list and the "View License" list.
2. Identified that many computers marked as licensed were offline and not occupying licenses.
3. Confirmed that the total count of licensed computers was greater than the number of licenses occupied.
4. Attempted to release licenses for the affected computers.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch in the licensing status of offline computers. These computers remained marked as "Licensed" despite not occupying any licenses, likely due to a failure in the system to update the licensing status for offline devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by releasing all computer licenses. This action updated the licensing status and corrected the discrepancies between the "Computers" list and the "View License" list, allowing the system to accurately reflect the current licensing situation.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly check the licensing status of offline computers to prevent similar discrepancies in the future.
- Consider implementing a routine maintenance check to ensure that the licensing status is updated for all devices, especially those that have been offline for an extended period.
