## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000It67FIAR
- **Case Number:** 428403
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Landeshauptstadt Hannover
- **Contact Name:** Lukas Rust
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 13.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Landeshauptstadt Hannover, purchased 12,000 licenses for Active Data Defence, with a contract starting on January 1, 2025. They needed assistance in adjusting the resources and settings of their virtual machine (VM) to meet the recommended specifications.

## Environment Details
- **Recommended Resources for 12,000 endpoints:**
  - 16 CPU cores
  - 56 GB RAM
  - 4 TB HDD
- **Current Allocation:** Only 1 TB HDD is allocated, with plans to finalize deployment by Q2 next year.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Contact:** The support team reached out to Lukas Rust to confirm the current resource allocation and schedule a remote session.
2. **Resource Confirmation:** Requested confirmation on whether the recommended resources had been allocated.
3. **Scheduling Attempts:** Proposed a remote session for December 4, 2024, at 10 AM Berlin time, which was not suitable for the customer.
4. **Follow-up Communication:** Continued to communicate with the customer to find a suitable time for the remote session.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's inability to allocate the recommended resources (specifically the HDD space) for the Endpoint Protector Server Appliance, which was necessary for optimal performance.

## Solution
The support team optimized the Endpoint Protector Server Appliance after confirming the resource allocation. The customer was advised to allocate the recommended resources as soon as possible to ensure the system would run efficiently once fully deployed.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to allocate the recommended resources to avoid performance issues, especially when dealing with a large number of endpoints.
- Future communications should emphasize the importance of resource allocation and provide clear guidance on the implications of insufficient resources.
