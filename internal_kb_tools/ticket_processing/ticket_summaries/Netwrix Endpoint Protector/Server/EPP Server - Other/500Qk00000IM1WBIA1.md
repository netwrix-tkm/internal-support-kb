The customer reported that "Backend Security Updates" were not being installed. The user attempted to apply the updates but received a message from the root user indicating that "Updates are not applied."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. A remote connection was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause

## Notes
