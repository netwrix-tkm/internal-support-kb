## Problem Description
The customer, David Patscheider from Barmherzige Brüder Österreich, inquired about the installation of the Splunk Universal Forwarder and Tenable Nessus Agent on their on-premise EPP servers. The customer indicated that they lacked the necessary root password/permissions to perform the installation themselves and sought assistance from Netwrix.

## Environment Details
- On-premise EPP servers
- Required installations: Splunk Universal Forwarder, Tenable Nessus Agent

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer confirmed knowledge of installation procedures but lacked root access.
2. Netwrix Support reached out to confirm if further assistance was needed.
3. Customer responded indicating that their question had been answered and requested to close the ticket.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of root permissions on their servers, which prevented them from installing the required software.

## Solution
The customer was informed that they would need root access to install the Splunk Universal Forwarder and Tenable Nessus Agent themselves. Since the customer confirmed that their question was answered and no further assistance was required, the ticket was closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the necessary permissions required for software installations on their servers.
- Future inquiries regarding installations should clarify the need for administrative access upfront to streamline support processes.
