- **Case Number:** 420579
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stanford University
- **Contact Name:** Spencer Chinn
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 10.3

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the functionality of the "Automatic Release License" feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) and its implications for managing unlicensed computers. Specifically, they wanted to know if enabling this feature would also remove unlicensed computers from the EPP inventory or if manual deletion was necessary. Additionally, they sought clarification on the reasoning behind maintaining an inventory of unlicensed clients and the consequences of deleting them.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration settings for the "Automatic Release License" feature.
2. Analyzed the behavior of the EPP inventory regarding unlicensed computers.
3. Consulted documentation regarding license recovery and inventory management.
4. Clarified the implications of deleting unlicensed computers from the inventory.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the customer's confusion stemmed from a lack of clarity in the EPP documentation regarding the automatic license recovery process and its impact on the inventory of unlicensed computers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed information regarding the following:
- Enabling "Automatic Release License" does not automatically remove unlicensed computers from the EPP inventory; manual deletion is required.
- The rationale for keeping unlicensed computers in the inventory is to maintain historical data and facilitate potential future license allocation if those computers check back in.
- If unlicensed computers are deleted from the inventory, they will not automatically receive a new license upon checking back in; a new license must be issued manually.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that while the "Automatic Release License" feature helps manage licenses, it does not handle inventory cleanup for unlicensed computers.
- Future users should be aware that deleting unlicensed computers may affect license management and historical tracking within the EPP system.
