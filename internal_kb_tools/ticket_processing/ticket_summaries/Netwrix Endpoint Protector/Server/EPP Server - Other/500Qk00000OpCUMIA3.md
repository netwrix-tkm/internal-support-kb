- **Case Number:** 444129
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Look Company
- **Contact Name:** Lewies Thomas
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SSD hosting the virtual disk for their EPP (Endpoint Protector) virtual machine had become corrupted, rendering the VM inoperable. They sought assistance to explore options for recovery.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the SSD where the EPP VM was hosted.
- No snapshots were available for recovery.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Informed the customer that without snapshots, a new EPP VM would need to be installed from scratch.
2. Scheduled a remote session to assist with the installation.
3. Attempted to conduct a remote session on 07-05, but the customer could not join due to personal issues.
4. Conducted a successful remote session on 08-05, where a new EPP server was deployed and configured.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the corruption of the SSD that hosted the virtual disk for the EPP VM, which was beyond recovery due to the absence of snapshots.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a new EPP server during a remote session. The server was configured properly, and the customer was advised to monitor the new server for a few days to ensure stability before closing the case.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to maintain regular snapshots of their VMs to prevent data loss in case of hardware failures.
- Future cases involving SSD corruption should follow a similar protocol of assessing snapshot availability and preparing for a fresh installation if necessary.
