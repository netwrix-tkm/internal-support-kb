- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BWKa3IAH
- **Case Number:** 411227
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Haleon
- **Contact Name:** Sudhir Baral
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Server
- **Feature:** EPP Server - Other
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that email reports were not being triggered from their instance due to an email configuration and relay issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on the Haleon production server.
- The email system was integrated with Mimecast for email relay.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the email configuration settings in the management console.
2. Conducted tests to send emails using the provided credentials.
3. Analyzed logs from the email system which indicated "bad credentials."
4. Engaged with Mimecast support to investigate the authentication errors.
5. Reset the email password and updated the credentials in the management console.
6. Conducted further tests after the password reset, but no emails were triggered.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incorrect email credentials being used for the SMTP relay to Mimecast. Despite the credentials appearing correct, the authentication failed due to a mismatch or configuration issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Engineering assistance in performing a backend configuration change for Haleon.
- Updating the email credentials in the management console to ensure they matched the new password.
- Conducting tests post-configuration which confirmed that emails were successfully sent.

## Notes
- Ensure that any password changes are promptly updated in all relevant configurations to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify the validity of credentials with the email service provider (in this case, Mimecast) if authentication errors persist after configuration changes.
- Monitor the system for a period after resolution to confirm that email alerts are functioning as expected.
