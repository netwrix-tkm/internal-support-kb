- **Contact Name:** Guy Asher

- **Component:** EPP Server
- **Feature:** Endpoint Protection

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP server was down and encountered a parse error in the configuration file, specifically: 
```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_VAR in /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/cache/ratool/prod/config/config_logging.yml.php on line 21
```

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician reached out to the customer to schedule a remote session for further investigation.
2. Follow-up emails were sent to confirm the availability of the customer for a remote session.
3. The customer eventually performed a server reboot.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a syntax error in the configuration file (`config_logging.yml.php`), which likely caused the EPP server to become unresponsive.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer performed a reboot of the EPP server. This action cleared the error and restored functionality.

## Notes
- It is advisable to check configuration files for syntax errors if similar parse errors occur in the future.
- Regular monitoring and maintenance of the server can help prevent such issues from arising.
- Ensure that backups of configuration files are maintained to facilitate recovery in case of corruption or errors.
