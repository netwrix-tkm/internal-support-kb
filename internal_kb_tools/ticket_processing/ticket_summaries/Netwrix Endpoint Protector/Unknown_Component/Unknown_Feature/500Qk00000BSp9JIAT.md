## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BSp9JIAT
- **Case Number:** 411008
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Perma-tec GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Joshua Kraus
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Virtual Machine Installation
- **Feature:** vSphere Client
- **Version:** 7.0.3.01100

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with the installation of a virtual machine (VM) on their vSphere Client. They encountered an error code when attempting to start the VM, which they suspected might be due to an unsupported client version.

## Environment Details
- **vSphere Client Version:** 7.0.3.01100
- **Supported Version on Download Page:** 6.0.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to start the VM on the vSphere Client but received an error code.
2. They checked the compatibility of their vSphere Client version against the supported versions listed on the download page.
3. The customer attempted to connect to the VM via SSH but lacked the necessary credentials.
4. The support engineer requested a screenshot of the error code for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue arose during the creation of the VM, where a second virtual network card, which is required for the VM to function properly, was inadvertently deleted. This led to an error when the VM was started, as the web server could not be initiated without the second network card.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by adding a second virtual network card to the VM configuration. Once this was done, the VM was able to start successfully, and the web server functioned as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that all required network configurations are in place when creating a VM to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify compatibility with the latest versions of the vSphere Client and the Netwrix Endpoint Protector before installation.
