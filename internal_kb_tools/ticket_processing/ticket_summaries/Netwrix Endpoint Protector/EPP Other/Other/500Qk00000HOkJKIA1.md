- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that laptops used in their Hong Kong office, which are not part of the company network, require an update to the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) policy. These laptops connect to the Citrix environment but do not report to the management console due to their off-network status.

## Environment Details
- Laptops shipped with a pre-installed security stack.
- The laptops are not connected to the Ropes and Gray network.
- The EPP server must be accessible over the internet for policy updates.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the EPP server is online and capable of communication with agents.
2. Reviewed firewall rules to determine if they restrict connections from off-network machines.
3. Suggested the use of a VPN for off-network machines to connect to the U.S. network for policy updates.
4. Verified that the EPP clients need to be installed with the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to firewall rules that only allowed connections from the U.S. network, preventing the Hong Kong laptops from communicating with the EPP server. Additionally, the EPP clients were not configured with the correct FQDN for the server.

## Solution
The resolution involved ensuring that:
- The EPP server is connected to the internet and has an associated FQDN.
- The firewall rules are adjusted to allow connections from the off-network machines in Hong Kong.
- The EPP clients on the laptops are configured with the correct FQDN of the EPP server.

The customer was provided with the necessary information to implement these changes, and they confirmed the resolution of the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future off-network machines are configured with the correct FQDN for the EPP server.
- Review and adjust firewall rules as necessary to allow for remote updates to the EPP policy.
- Consider documenting the process for configuring firewall rules and FQDN settings for off-network devices to assist future cases.
