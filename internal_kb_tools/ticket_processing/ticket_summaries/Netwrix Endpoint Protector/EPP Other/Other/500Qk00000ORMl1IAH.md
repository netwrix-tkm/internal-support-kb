- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Laykon Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Faruk SarÄ±
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Custom Notifications
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in customizing the notifications that appear on the user side for the Device Control module of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They were able to make adjustments for the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module but faced challenges with the Device Control notifications.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's requirement for custom notifications for the Device Control module.
2. Advised the customer to enable "Custom client notifications" on the specific computer settings within the Device Control section.
3. Instructed the customer to navigate to "System Parameters" -> "Device Types and Notifications" to select a default notification type and enable custom notifications.
4. Verified the language settings of the EPP server to ensure the custom notifications were set up in the correct language.
5. Created a test custom notification for denied USB devices to demonstrate the process.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the initial configuration settings within the Device Control module, which did not have the custom notifications enabled. The language settings of the EPP server also played a role in ensuring the correct setup of notifications.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following these steps:
- Enabling "Custom client notifications" in the Device Control settings for the specific computer.
- Selecting a default notification type and enabling custom notifications in the System Parameters.
- Creating and saving a test custom notification for denied USB devices, which confirmed that the customization was successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that the language settings of the EPP server are checked before setting up custom notifications, as this can affect the visibility and functionality of the notifications.
- Future requests for customization should follow a similar troubleshooting approach to verify settings and configurations in the Device Control module.
