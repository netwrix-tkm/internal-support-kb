## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in clearing old logs from the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server due to storage concerns and the need for compliance during an upcoming audit.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server was running version 5.9.3.0.
- The last logs generated in the console were from 2021, indicating that no new logs were being recorded.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the support request and confirmed receipt of the ticket.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue further.
3. Cleared old logs from the EPP server as per the customer's request.
4. Verified the functionality of the logging system post-clearance to ensure new logs could be generated.

## Root Cause
The accumulation of old logs was likely due to a lack of regular maintenance or automated log clearing processes, which led to storage issues on the EPP server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually clearing the old logs from the EPP server. After the logs were cleared, the system was monitored to ensure that new logs were being generated correctly.

## Notes
- It is recommended to implement a regular log maintenance schedule to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that the customer is aware of the importance of monitoring log storage and setting up alerts for when storage thresholds are approached.
