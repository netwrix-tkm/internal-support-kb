- **Case Number:** 412782
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sitetracker
- **Contact Name:** Gokulnath Murugesan
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after increasing their Endpoint Protector (EPP) license count from 385 to 400, the new total was not reflected in the admin portal, which still displayed the old count of 385. Additionally, the customer noted that some system licensing appeared to be duplicated.

## Environment Details
- The customer is located in India (UTC+05:30).
- The issue pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication was established with the customer to gather more details about the issue.
2. A remote session was scheduled to investigate the license count discrepancy further.
3. During the remote session, the technical support engineer reviewed the license settings and configurations in the admin portal.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a delay in the synchronization of the license count in the admin portal following the recent license increase. This can occur due to backend processing times or caching issues within the portal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Performing a manual refresh of the license count in the admin portal during the remote session.
- Confirming that the new license count of 400 was correctly displayed post-refresh.
- Advising the customer to monitor the portal for any further discrepancies and to reach out if similar issues arise.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that changes in license counts may not reflect immediately due to backend processing times.
- Encourage customers to perform a manual refresh of the portal if they encounter similar issues in the future.
- Document any repeated licensing issues for further investigation to prevent future occurrences.
