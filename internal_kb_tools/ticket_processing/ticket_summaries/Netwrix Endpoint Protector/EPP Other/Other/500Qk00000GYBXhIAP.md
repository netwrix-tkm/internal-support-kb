- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Samsung 4TB T7 drive was not mounting on a Mac mini, suspecting that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) was blocking the connection.

## Environment Details
- **Device:** Samsung 4TB T7 external drive
- **Operating System:** macOS (specific version not provided)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the Mac mini recognized the Samsung 4TB T7 drive.
2. Assessed the EPP settings to determine if any policies were preventing the drive from mounting.
3. Engaged in email communications with the customer to gather additional information and confirm testing schedules.
4. Provided a test build of the EPP software that included fixes related to device connection issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a conflict between the EPP settings and the external drive's connection process, which was preventing the drive from mounting properly.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by providing the customer with a test build of the EPP software that included improvements related to device control and connection handling. The customer confirmed that the test build fixed the issue, allowing the drive to connect successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the test build should only be installed on a limited number of devices for testing purposes before wider deployment.
- Future cases involving external drives not mounting should consider checking EPP settings and providing test builds if necessary.
