## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to log in to their EPP Server UI using the account `mauro.vecchiato@sanmarcogroup.it`. Upon attempting to log in, they were prompted to reset their password. However, after entering the new password (which was the same as the one just used), they received an error stating, "The password provided is different from the existing password."

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was attempting to access the online console.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the login credentials provided by the customer.
2. Attempted to log in with the existing password to confirm the error message.
3. Initiated a password reset procedure to allow access with the root administrator account.
4. Provided the customer with the default password after the reset.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch between the password entered by the customer and the existing password stored in the system. This could have been due to a temporary glitch or a synchronization issue during the password reset process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a password reset procedure, which allowed the customer to log in using the root administrator account with the default password. The customer was able to access the EPP Server UI successfully after this intervention.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the importance of using the correct password format during resets.
- It may be beneficial to implement additional checks or confirmations during the password reset process to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Document any similar cases for reference to streamline troubleshooting in the future.
