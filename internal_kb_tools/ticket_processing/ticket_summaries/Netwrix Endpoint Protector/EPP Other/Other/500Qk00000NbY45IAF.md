## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NbY45IAF
- **Case Number:** 440726
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PwC
- **Contact Name:** DFI SUPPORT
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to connect to the EPP (Endpoint Protector) console via the web, despite being able to ping the IP address of the deployed instance. The frontend displayed options 1 through 5, but an error occurred upon restarting the VM, indicating a failure to start a high-level service and a reverse proxy server.

## Environment Details
- Deployment: On-premises instance of EPP
- Network Configuration: Initially configured with only one Network Adapter

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was asked to verify if two bridged Network Adapters were attached to the EPP VM.
2. Awaited customer confirmation regarding the network adapter configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the server being configured with only one Network Adapter, which was insufficient for the proper functioning of the EPP console.

## Solution
The customer was informed of the necessity to add a second Network Adapter to the EPP VM. Upon adding the second adapter, the issue was resolved, and the customer was able to connect to the EPP console successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that future deployments of EPP include at least two bridged Network Adapters to avoid similar connectivity issues.
- If issues persist after confirming the network configuration, further investigation may be required to identify other potential causes.
