## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving email notifications but was unable to view any information after logging into the system.

## Environment Details
The issue was related to vulnerabilities in the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify products, as highlighted in a security advisory (ADV-2024-002) issued by Netwrix.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team initially responded to the customer and acknowledged the issue.
2. The customer was directed to check the security advisory link for more information: [Security Advisory Link](https://security.netwrix.com/advisories/adv-2024-002).
3. The customer confirmed they could not access the information via the provided link.
4. The support team provided details about the vulnerabilities affecting the product, including CVE identifiers and descriptions.
5. A hotfix was recommended to address the vulnerabilities, and the customer was instructed on how to apply it via the Dashboard > Live update > Check Now.
6. The customer indicated they could not update the system and requested an offline patch.
7. An offline patch was provided to the customer for older server versions.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from remote code execution vulnerabilities in the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify products, which prevented the customer from accessing the necessary information after logging in.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix (adv-2024-002) to address the identified vulnerabilities. The customer was also provided with an offline patch for older versions of the software, allowing them to apply necessary updates without upgrading to the latest version.

## Notes
- It is strongly recommended to apply the hotfix to version 5.9.3.0 or later to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
- If customers are unable to update to the latest version, offline patches are available for older server versions (5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0) upon request.
- Future communications should emphasize the importance of keeping software updated to avoid similar issues related to security vulnerabilities.
