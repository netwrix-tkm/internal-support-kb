The customer reported that no updates were showing when they checked for updates and requested assistance on how to upgrade to the remediated version.

## Root Cause
The customer was running an outdated version of the EPP (5.4.9.1) that required an upgrade to address a security vulnerability as indicated by the security notice ADV-2025-010. The absence of automatic updates was due to the version being outdated and not configured to receive updates.

## Solution
During the scheduled remote session, the technical support team applied the offline patch to upgrade the EPP appliance from version 5.4.9.1 to 5.9.4.2 successfully. This resolved the vulnerability issue as per the security notice.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the importance of keeping their software updated to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- For cloud-hosted products, remind customers that they may not have the ability to take snapshots or perform certain actions that are typically available in on-premises deployments.
- Future communications should clarify the upgrade process and confirm the customer's availability to expedite resolution.
