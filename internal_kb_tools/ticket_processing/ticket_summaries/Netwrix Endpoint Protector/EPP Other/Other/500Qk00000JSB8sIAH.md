- **Contact Name:** daehee kim
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5.9.0.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about how to utilize a new feature introduced in the 5.9.0.0 update of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically regarding a command-line switch (environment variable) for deactivating the CAP driver during the EPP client installation on RHEL 8.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8
- **EPP Version:** 5.9.0.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer requested guidance on using the new command-line switch feature.
2. Support escalated the ticket for further investigation.
3. A DevOps engineer provided instructions on modifying the installation script.
4. The customer was advised to uncomment specific lines in the `options.sh` file and set the variable `EPPCLIENT_DISABLECAP` to `1`.

## Root Cause
The customer was unaware of how to implement the new command-line switch feature introduced in the latest update, which is intended to streamline the installation process when CAP functionality is not required.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the following instructions:
- Locate the `options.sh` file in the installation package.
- Uncomment the following lines by removing the `#` at the start:
  ```bash
  EPPCLIENT_DISABLECAP=1
  export EPPCLIENT_DISABLECAP
  ```
- This configuration allows the installation to proceed without the CAP driver.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of new features introduced in updates and provide clear documentation or instructions on how to use them.
- Future inquiries regarding similar features should reference the specific lines in the installation script that need modification.
