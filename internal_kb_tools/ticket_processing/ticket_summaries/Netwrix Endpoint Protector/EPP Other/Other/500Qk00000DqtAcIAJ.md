## Environment Details

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Checked the validity period of the license file to ensure it was not expired.
3. Confirmed the format and content of the license file were correct.
4. Attempted to re-import the license file multiple times.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure to recognize the license file due to a potential mismatch in the expected format or content validation by the system, despite the license being valid and within the grace period.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully importing the license file after confirming its validity and ensuring that the server ID matched. The import process was retried, and this time it completed without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that the server ID in the license file always matches the EPP server ID to avoid import issues.
- Always verify the license file's validity period before attempting an import.
- If similar issues arise, consider rechecking the license file format and content for any discrepancies.
