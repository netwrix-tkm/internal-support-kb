## Problem Description
The customer reported a vulnerability identified as "ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure" during a Tenable vulnerability scan on their EPP server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the handling of ICMP requests on the EPP server, which was running on an unspecified version of Ubuntu.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer initially advised the customer to apply all available backend security updates through the Dashboard -> Live Update.
2. After the updates were applied, the customer confirmed that the vulnerability persisted.
3. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
4. During the remote session, the support engineer identified that the ICMP requests could be blocked using iptables.

## Root Cause
The vulnerability was due to the server's handling of ICMP timestamp requests, which could potentially disclose the server's date and time information. This issue was likely exacerbated by the server's configuration and the version of the operating system in use.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following iptables rule was added to block all incoming ICMP requests:
```bash
-A INPUT -p icmp -j REJECT
```
After adding the rule, the iptables configuration was reloaded with the command:
```bash
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```
This effectively mitigated the vulnerability by preventing the server from responding to ICMP timestamp requests.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly check for and apply backend security updates to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
- Future configurations should consider implementing iptables rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, especially on servers exposed to the internet.
- Ensure that any changes to iptables rules are documented and tested to avoid unintended service disruptions.
