## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance on how to ingest EPP log data into their Wazuh SIEM tool for centralized management. They inquired whether this integration was possible and how to achieve it.

## Environment Details
- **SIEM Tool:** Wazuh (https://wazuh.com/)
- **EPP Tool:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Informed the customer that the SIEM can be added to the EPP server through the UI options under "Appliance > SIEM Integration."
3. Clarified that logs are sent in syslog - RFC-5424 format.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of knowledge regarding the integration process between Netwrix Endpoint Protector and the Wazuh SIEM tool. The customer was unaware of the specific steps required to configure the integration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to the relevant section of the user manual and providing clear instructions on how to set up the SIEM integration through the EPP interface. The customer was informed that the logs would be transmitted in the syslog - RFC-5424 format, which is compatible with Wazuh.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the log format (syslog - RFC-5424) when integrating with SIEM tools.
- Encourage customers to refer to the user manual for detailed instructions on integration processes to avoid similar inquiries in the future.
