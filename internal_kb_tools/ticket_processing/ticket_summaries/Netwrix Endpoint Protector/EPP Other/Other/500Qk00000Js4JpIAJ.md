- **Case Number:** 430672
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SEON
- **Contact Name:** Richard Leonard Kirner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, SEON, required assistance in creating a mobileconfig file for deploying the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent on macOS systems via JumpCloud. They had attempted to create the file but were unsuccessful and needed it to ensure that necessary permissions for Endpoint Protector were granted centrally, avoiding manual permission granting by users.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Environment:** Approximately 300 macOS computers in production.
- **Deployment Method:** JumpCloud.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the mobileconfig file provided by the customer.
2. Engaged a developer to assess the file for completeness and correctness regarding permissions for Endpoint Protector.
3. Verified that the mobileconfig file included all necessary configurations for centralized deployment.

## Root Cause
The initial mobileconfig file created by the customer lacked the necessary configurations to grant permissions for the Endpoint Protector agent deployment on macOS systems.

## Solution
The developer reviewed and modified the mobileconfig file to ensure it contained all required settings for granting permissions centrally. The updated file was then provided to the customer for deployment.

## Notes
- Ensure that future requests for mobileconfig files include a checklist of required permissions and configurations to streamline the process.
- Recommend providing documentation or templates for creating mobileconfig files to assist customers in future deployments.
