## Problem Description
The customer reported inconsistencies in the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) reporting, where the DLP agent was not reporting correctly on some user machines. Additionally, there were issues with the connection to the SIEM tool, which was also not receiving any information.

## Environment Details
- The DLP agent was installed on multiple user machines.
- The EPP server's hosting details were not specified by the customer.
- The customer was using a SIEM solution, but the specific type of logs supported was not provided.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initiated communication with the customer to schedule a remote session for further investigation.
2. Requested access to one of the affected end-user computers to check the EPP client and generate logs.
3. Inquired about the hosting environment of the EPP server (VM, Azure, AWS, GCP).
4. Asked the customer to specify the types of logs their SIEM solution supports (e.g., rsyslog, syslog-ng).
5. Reviewed the logs and settings on the EPP server to identify any discrepancies.
6. Checked the dashboard data and the cron job responsible for updating the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the logging mechanism that prevented the DLP agent from sending logs to the dashboard and the SIEM tool. Specifically, the logs were not being generated or were not reaching the intended destinations due to configuration issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Ensuring that the logging configuration on the EPP server was correctly set up to capture and forward logs to the dashboard and the SIEM tool.
- Verifying that the cron job responsible for updating the dashboard was functioning correctly and that the necessary logs were being generated.
- After making the necessary adjustments, the DLP reporting began to function as expected, and the connection to the SIEM tool was restored.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly check the logging configuration and the status of cron jobs to ensure that logs are being generated and forwarded correctly.
- Customers should be encouraged to provide detailed information about their environment and any specific configurations they have in place to facilitate quicker troubleshooting.
