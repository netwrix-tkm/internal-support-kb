- **Case Number:** 428962
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5.2

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that the "partitions" were missing from the Reports and Analysis section of the Content Aware Report in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's query regarding the disappearance of "partitions" in the CAP report.
2. Analyzed the database of the server to check the amount of logs related to the CAP.
3. Confirmed that the logs were present and accounted for, indicating no additional partitions were necessary.

## Root Cause
The investigation revealed that the amount of logs in the database was correct, and there were no additional partitions required for the CAP logs. The absence of "partitions" was not indicative of a technical issue but rather a misunderstanding of the reporting structure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that the logs were correctly accounted for and that the structure of the reports did not necessitate additional partitions. No further action was required as the system was functioning as intended.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that customers understand the reporting structure and how logs are managed within the system to prevent confusion regarding missing elements in reports.
- Future inquiries regarding report structures should include a review of the database logs to confirm their status before responding to customer concerns.
