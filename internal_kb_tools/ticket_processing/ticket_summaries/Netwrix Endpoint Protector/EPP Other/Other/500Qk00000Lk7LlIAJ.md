- **Case Number:** 435403
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** E-Data Teknoloji Pazarlama
- **Contact Name:** Yunus ICIN
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Turknet, had several inquiries regarding the renewal of their license for the On-prem version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They were particularly interested in the migration process to the SaaS version, data retention in the cloud, traffic flow on user computers, and the interaction of the DLP agent with proxies and VPNs.

## Environment Details
- **Current Setup:** On-prem version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Proxy Product:** Symantec Broadcom Proxy WSS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's questions regarding the migration process from On-prem to SaaS.
2. Investigated how configurations would be affected during migration.
3. Clarified data retention policies in the cloud post-migration.
4. Analyzed traffic flow on user computers, specifically in relation to DPI behavior with proxies and VPNs.
5. Discussed certificate distribution methods and the relationship between the DLP agent and the Symantec Broadcom Proxy WSS product.
6. Addressed how traffic is handled (encrypted/decrypted) by the DLP agent.

## Root Cause
The inquiries stemmed from the customer's need for clarity on the migration process and operational behavior of the DLP system in conjunction with existing network security measures (proxy and VPN).

## Solution
The customer's questions were answered comprehensively, including:
- The migration process from On-prem to SaaS and the implications for configurations and data retention.
- Detailed explanations of traffic flow, DPI behavior with proxies and VPNs, and certificate distribution.
- Clarified how traffic is processed by the DLP agent in relation to encryption.

Additionally, a feature request (FR) was created as requested by the customer (FR ID: 00437188).

## Notes
- Ensure that future inquiries regarding migration processes include detailed information on configuration impacts and data retention policies.
- When dealing with similar cases, be prepared to explain the interaction between DLP agents and third-party products like proxies and VPNs, as well as the implications for traffic encryption.
