## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician, Cristian Tornea, contacted the customer to confirm the issue.
2. Dena Thomas requested an extension of the licenses through March 7, 2025.
3. The technician checked Salesforce and found that the order for the license extension had not yet been processed.
4. Cristian reached out to Sara Hall for assistance, as she was more familiar with licensing issues.
5. Cristian contacted Vlad in order management to process the POC license extension.
6. Sara Hall provided the new license key to the customer and copied the account manager, Chris Roney, on the email for reference.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the request for the license extension was in Salesforce but had not been processed in a timely manner, leading to the expiration of the licenses without the customer being notified.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by processing the POC license extension through order management. The new license key was provided to the customer, allowing them to continue their testing without interruption.

## Notes
- Ensure that requests for license extensions are processed promptly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to set reminders for follow-ups on pending license requests to ensure timely processing.
- Always confirm with the customer after processing any changes to ensure they have received the necessary information and access.
