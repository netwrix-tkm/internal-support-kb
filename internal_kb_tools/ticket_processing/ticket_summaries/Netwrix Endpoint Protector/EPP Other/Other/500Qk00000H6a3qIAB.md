- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H6a3qIAB
- **Case Number:** 424090
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KEURO Besitz GmbH & Co. EDV-Dienstleistungs KG
- **Contact Name:** Benjamin Gutberlet
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
Users reported issues with Microsoft Teams calls and meetings after the installation of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client. Specifically, users were unable to be heard by others during calls and faced difficulties joining meetings.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed across multiple client versions.
- The problem arose after a server upgrade to the latest version of the Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the issue by the support team.
2. Management escalation for further investigation.
3. Suggested changing the custom port configuration for port 8077 from "Proxy" to "HTTPS".
4. Requested logs from a previous working version (6.2.2.1006) for comparison with the current version (6.2.4.0003).
5. Proposed a remote session to capture network traffic using Wireshark if the issue persisted.
6. Recommended adding a DPI allow-list entry for `*.relay.teams.microsoft.com`.

## Root Cause
The issue was linked to the configuration of the Endpoint Protector in relation to Microsoft Teams' network requirements. The inability to hear users during calls was likely due to the DPI settings interfering with Teams' traffic.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding the domain `*.relay.teams.microsoft.com` to the DPI allow-list as recommended by the support team. This adjustment allowed Teams to function correctly without interference from the Endpoint Protector.

## Notes
- Whitelisting the domain `*.relay.teams.microsoft.com` should not affect the scanning functionality of Endpoint Protector.
- Future cases involving Teams connectivity issues should consider DPI settings and proxy configurations as potential factors.
