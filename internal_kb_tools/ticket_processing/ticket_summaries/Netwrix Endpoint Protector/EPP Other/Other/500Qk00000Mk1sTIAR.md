## Problem Description
The customer reported that the UI console password had expired and was reset to a new password. However, they were unable to log in using the new password and requested assistance in resetting the password on the server.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted on AWS.
- SSH port used for connection is 62828.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to log in with the new password but was unsuccessful.
2. The customer inquired about alternative SSH ports after failing to connect using port 62828.
3. Netwrix support confirmed that the SSH port is 62828 and advised the customer to allow it for connection.
4. A remote connection was proposed to reset the password, and a meeting was scheduled.
5. The customer reported that the SSH issue was resolved prior to the scheduled meeting.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the expired password and subsequent failure to log in with the newly set password. Additionally, there were initial connectivity issues related to SSH, which were resolved before the remote session.

## Solution
The support technician conducted a remote session to reset the password on the server. During this session, they also removed unnecessary shadows and set up an audit log backup, which helped in clearing space occupied by logs.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SSH port (62828) is allowed for connections to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly monitor and manage log files to prevent space issues that could affect server performance.
- Always confirm the successful reset of passwords and connectivity before concluding support cases.
