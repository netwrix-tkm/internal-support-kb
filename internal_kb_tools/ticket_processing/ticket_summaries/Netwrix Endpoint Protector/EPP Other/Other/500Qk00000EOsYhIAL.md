## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to create new admin users in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system. The portal would become unresponsive or "locked" after clicking the save button during the admin creation process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

3. Attempted to replicate the issue in a test environment to isolate the problem.
4. Reviewed the configuration settings related to user management and admin creation.
5. Cleared the browser cache and attempted the process in different browsers to rule out client-side issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was determined that there may have been a temporary glitch in the system that caused the admin creation process to hang.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully creating the admin user after performing a series of backend checks and adjustments. It is likely that the system required a refresh or that the initial attempts were affected by transient issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that all user permissions are correctly configured before attempting to create new admin accounts.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking for system updates or patches that may address underlying bugs.
- It may be beneficial to monitor the system logs for any recurring errors related to user management to prevent future occurrences.
