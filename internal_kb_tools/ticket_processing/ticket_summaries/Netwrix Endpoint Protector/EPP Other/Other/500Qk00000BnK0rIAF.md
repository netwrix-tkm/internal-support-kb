- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BnK0rIAF
- **Case Number:** 411837
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tecplix Technologies Private Limited
- **Contact Name:** Himanshu Vaidya
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to open the console of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) and that the console had been running slowly in recent days.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a corporate environment using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made by the customer, detailing the inability to access the EPP console.
2. A remote connection was proposed to investigate the issue further.
3. The support team analyzed the server's logging and connection settings.
4. Bypass logging was stopped to reduce unnecessary load.
5. The maximum connections to the server were reduced to alleviate performance issues.

## Root Cause
The slow performance and inability to access the console were primarily caused by clients communicating with the server at a very low refresh interval of 20 seconds, which overloaded the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Stopping bypass logging.
- Reducing the maximum connections to the server.
- Modifying the refresh interval from 20 seconds to a more optimal setting of 300 seconds or higher, which significantly reduced the load on the appliance.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the refresh interval settings in similar environments to prevent server overload.
- Future configurations should consider setting a default refresh interval of at least 300 seconds to ensure optimal performance.
