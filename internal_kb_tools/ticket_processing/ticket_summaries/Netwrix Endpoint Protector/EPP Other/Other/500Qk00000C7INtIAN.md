## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Microsoft Teams application was not functioning on certain systems when the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software was installed. The application would run normally when the DLP was uninstalled, indicating a conflict between the DLP and Teams.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on multiple systems.
- The DLP policies were set to Monitoring mode, with no policies enabled to block Teams or any other applications.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the DLP was uninstalled, and Teams functioned correctly.
2. Reinstalled the DLP to verify that the issue reoccurred with Teams.
3. Reviewed DLP policies to ensure no blocking policies were enabled.
4. Requested additional details from the customer, including the operating system and EPP server/client versions.
5. Asked for a short video demonstrating the issue for better understanding.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between the DLP software and the Microsoft Teams application. Although no blocking policies were enabled, the DLP was interfering with the normal operation of Teams.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the DLP settings to ensure compatibility with Microsoft Teams. Specific configurations were made to allow Teams to run without interference from the DLP software. The exact adjustments were not detailed in the case, but the resolution involved ensuring that the DLP did not restrict Teams' functionality.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review DLP policies and their impact on critical applications like Microsoft Teams.
- Future cases involving application conflicts with DLP should consider checking for any hidden or default settings that may inadvertently block application functionality.
- Customers should be encouraged to provide detailed information about their environment and any error messages encountered to expedite troubleshooting.
