## Problem Description
The customer reported being unable to log in to their EPP server due to their password no longer being accepted. They were also unable to reset their password.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server is hosted by CoSoSys.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the customer's login credentials.
2. Attempted to reset the password through the standard reset process, which was unsuccessful.
3. Reset the password to the default password from the EPP Server's backend.

## Root Cause
The specific reason for the password failure was not identified. It could have been due to a forgotten password or a potential issue with the password management system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the password to the default password from the backend of the EPP server. The customer was then asked to confirm if they could log in successfully with the new password.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the default password reset process for future reference.
- It may be beneficial to implement a more robust password recovery mechanism to prevent similar issues from arising.
- Follow up with the customer to confirm successful login after password resets to ensure closure of the ticket.
