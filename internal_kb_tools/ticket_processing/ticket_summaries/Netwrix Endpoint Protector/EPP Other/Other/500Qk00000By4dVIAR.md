## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EPP server was consuming high disk space. Despite purging recent logs, the disk space did not increase.

## Environment Details
- The EPP server was observed to consume 10 GB of disk space within the last 8 hours, with only 50 GB remaining on the appliance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer purged recent logs in an attempt to free up disk space.
2. A remote connection was scheduled to investigate the issue further.
3. During the remote session, the support engineer cleared the server using an audit log backup.
4. Shadows were turned off and removed to help manage disk space.

## Root Cause
The high disk space consumption was likely due to the accumulation of logs and shadows that were not being managed effectively, leading to rapid disk space depletion.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing the server using an audit log backup.
- Turning off and removing shadows, which helped to free up disk space.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to regularly monitor and manage log files and shadows to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a scheduled maintenance plan to automate log purging and shadow management to avoid disk space issues.
