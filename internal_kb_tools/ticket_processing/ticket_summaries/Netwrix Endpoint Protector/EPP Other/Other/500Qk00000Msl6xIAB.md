## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with an agent that was not communicating with the server, causing the device to go completely offline. They requested instructions on how to manually uninstall the agent.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a device running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific version of the product was not provided.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer provided a VB script to uninstall the client and instructed the customer to run it from the Command Prompt (CMD) as an administrator.
2. A screen recording demonstrating the uninstallation process was also sent to the customer.
3. The customer attempted to uninstall the agent directly from the machine without using the provided script.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The customer successfully uninstalled the EPP client manually from the machine shortly after opening the support ticket. They confirmed the uninstallation via email, indicating that no further assistance was required.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need to run scripts as an administrator when performing uninstallation tasks.
- It may be beneficial to include more detailed documentation on manual uninstallation procedures in future updates to the knowledge base to assist users facing similar issues.
