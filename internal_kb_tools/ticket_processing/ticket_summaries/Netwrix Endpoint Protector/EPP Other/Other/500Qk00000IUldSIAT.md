## Problem Description
The customer, Denni Sembiring from Halodata International Pte Ltd, requested assistance in providing specific information for a third-party service assessment related to Bank Aladin. The inquiries included details about the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for the Cloud-hosted EPP server, as well as the version of the MySQL database management system in use.

## Environment Details
- **Database Management System:** MySQL
- **MySQL Version:** 5.7.42

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Responded to the customer confirming that an internal backup saves the database every 3 days.
2. Advised the customer to check the Server Information page for more details.
3. Requested the customer to reattach the snapshot of the Server Information page when the initial attachment was not visible.
4. Provided the specific MySQL version after the customer reattached the necessary information.

## Root Cause
The initial inquiry was due to the customer's need for specific operational metrics (RPO and RTO) and versioning details of the database system, which were not readily available in the initial communication.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the following information:
- Confirmed that there is an internal backup every 3 days, which indirectly addresses the RPO.
- Provided the MySQL version as 5.7.42 after the customer reattached the Server Information page.

## Notes
- For future inquiries regarding RPO and RTO, it is important to clarify that these metrics may depend on internal backup policies and configurations.
- Ensure that attachments are properly sent and received to avoid delays in communication. If attachments are not visible, prompt the customer to resend them or offer to schedule a remote session for verification.
