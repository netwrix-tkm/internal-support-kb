## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NYy30IAD
- **Case Number:** 440614
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AJOOMAL PORTUGAL
- **Contact Name:** Iván Jiménez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 6.2.1.2004

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with uninstalling the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent version 6.2.1.2004 from a Windows 11 device. The uninstallation process failed due to a missing DLL file, specifically "MSIInstallerDLL.dll". After replacing the DLL with one from another device, the uninstallation prompted for an uninstall password that was not configured on the server.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Agent Version:** 6.2.1.2004

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to uninstall the agent, receiving an error regarding a missing DLL file.
2. The customer replaced the missing DLL with one from another device, which allowed the uninstallation process to proceed.
3. The uninstallation process prompted for an uninstall password, which the customer did not have.
4. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.
5. During the remote session, the ZAP tool was utilized to forcibly remove the EPP Client.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer forgetting the uninstall password that was assigned to an older machine, which was not communicating with the EPP Server. This led to complications during the uninstallation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by using the ZAP tool during a remote session to forcibly remove the EPP Client from the affected Windows 11 device. This bypassed the need for the uninstall password and successfully completed the uninstallation.

## Notes
- Ensure that all uninstall passwords are documented and accessible to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The ZAP tool can be an effective solution for forcibly removing the EPP Client when standard uninstallation methods fail.
- Always verify that the DLL files required for the uninstallation process are present and correctly configured before attempting to uninstall the agent.
