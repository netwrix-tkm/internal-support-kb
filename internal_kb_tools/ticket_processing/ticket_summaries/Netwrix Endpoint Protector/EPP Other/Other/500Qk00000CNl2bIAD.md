## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CNl2bIAD
- **Case Number:** 413295
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wolfspeed, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Tim Page
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5.9.2.8 (noted in communications)

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether they needed to update all agents in their environment after upgrading their on-prem platform to the latest version and hotfix to remediate a vulnerability. They also sought clarification on the status of Windows add-ons that were previously stated to be retired but still appeared in the portal.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) for deploying clients on their endpoints.
- The current version of the agents in most of their environment is 5.9.2.8.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed internally whether upgrading the EPP clients was necessary after the server upgrade.
2. Communicated with the customer regarding the need to upgrade the EPP clients to fully address the vulnerability.
3. Provided guidance on the deployment parameters for the new agent installation, specifically regarding the exclusion of Outlook extensions.
4. Addressed additional queries about the removal of Internet Explorer and Lotus Notes add-ons.

## Root Cause
The need to upgrade the EPP clients was identified as essential to fully remediate the vulnerability that prompted the server upgrade. The confusion regarding the Windows add-ons stemmed from a lack of clarity on their retirement status, which was still reflected in the portal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the customer must upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version to ensure complete vulnerability remediation. The following command was provided for deploying the new agent without the Outlook extension:

```bash
msiexec /i EPPClientSetup_6.2.1.2001.msi WSIP=demo.endpointprotector.com INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=0
```

Additionally, the customer was informed that they could use specific flags to remove any unwanted add-ons during the installation process.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to upgrade all EPP clients following a server upgrade to ensure security vulnerabilities are fully addressed.
- Clarification on the status of deprecated features (like Windows add-ons) should be communicated clearly to avoid confusion.
- Future communications should include explicit instructions for deployment parameters to streamline the upgrade process.
