## Problem Description
The customer, Intel Corporation, reported an issue regarding the renewal of their Endpoint Protector license. They received a single license file for 300 endpoints but required separate license files for 7 isolated domains with specific endpoint allocations.

## Environment Details
- **License Details:** 
  - Total Endpoints: 300
  - Isolated Domains and Endpoint Distribution:
    - Intel_Dev_Offline - 50 endpoints
    - Intel_Dev_Online - 40 endpoints
    - Intel_DR_Offline - 50 endpoints
    - Intel_DR_Online - 20 endpoints
    - Intel_PROD_Offline - 50 endpoints
    - Intel_PROD_Online - 20 endpoints
    - Intel_QA_Local - 50 endpoints
    - Intel_QA_Remote - 20 endpoints
- **License Validity:** 
  - Start Date: June 4, 2024
  - End Date: July 28, 2025

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the license file provided by the customer.
2. Confirmed the endpoint distribution requirements for the isolated domains.
3. Engaged with the customer to clarify their needs regarding separate license files.
4. Coordinated with the licensing team to generate the required separate license files.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the vendor providing a single license file for 300 endpoints instead of individual files tailored to the customer's specific domain and endpoint distribution requirements.

## Solution
The licensing team successfully generated and provided separate license files for each of the specified domains, allowing the customer to apply the licenses as needed. Andrew confirmed that the customer managed to apply the licenses without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that future license renewals consider the customer's specific endpoint distribution needs to avoid similar issues.
- Maintain clear communication with the customer regarding their requirements to facilitate a smoother licensing process.
