## Problem Description
The customer was unable to update their Netwrix Endpoint Protector server due to a newly installed firewall that disrupted the connection to the EPP Live Update service. They requested an offline update to upgrade the server to the latest version, including a hotfix for vulnerability ADV-2024-002.

## Notes
