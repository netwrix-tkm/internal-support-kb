## Problem Description
The customer, LR Prokuratura (Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Latvia), reported an issue where a user logging into the system using a local account was prompted to change their password. Despite entering the correct current password, the system returned an error indicating that the password was incorrect.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The user was accessing the system via a local account.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the user was entering the correct password by checking the login success.
2. Suggested the user attempt to change the password using different web browsers and after clearing cookies.
3. Scheduled a remote session to assist with the password reset.
4. During the remote session, attempted to change the password for the affected user.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it was determined that the password change prompt was not functioning correctly for the user, leading to repeated incorrect password errors despite successful logins.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session where the support engineer successfully reset the password for the affected user. The user was advised to monitor the situation for a couple of days to ensure the problem did not recur.

## Notes
- It is recommended to have a snapshot of the Endpoint Protector appliance prepared before troubleshooting sessions to ensure a quick recovery in case of unintended changes.
- Ensure that necessary applications (e.g., Putty, Zoom) are installed prior to remote sessions for better control and communication.
- Future cases involving password changes should consider potential underlying issues with the password management system or user account settings.
