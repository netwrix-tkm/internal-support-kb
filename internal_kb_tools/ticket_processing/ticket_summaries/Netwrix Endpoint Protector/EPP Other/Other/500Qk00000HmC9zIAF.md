- **Case Number:** 425831
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wealthfront Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Iman Frans
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported a licensing discrepancy where they had 200 licenses displayed in the Endpoint Protector (EPP) console, but 280 users were online. They also mentioned having a total of 350 licenses but were receiving alerts indicating they were low on licenses.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 12.2.
- The issue was observed in the Device Control section of the EPP console.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the total number of licenses (350) and that all were assigned.
2. Explained the difference between online computers and total licenses, including offline licensed computers.
3. Suggested checking the Device Control -> Computers section for a complete list of connected devices.
4. Recommended setting up automatic license release for computers that have been offline for a specified period.
5. Increased the maximum number of records displayed in the report search settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the maximum number of records displayed in the EPP console being set too low, which limited the visibility of online computers.

## Solution
During a remote session, the support technician increased the maximum number of displayed records in the EPP console settings. This adjustment allowed the console to correctly reflect the number of online computers, resolving the discrepancy.

## Notes
- It is recommended to set the "No. of records per report page" to 50 or lower to improve loading times.
- For future reference, consider enabling automatic license release to manage licenses more effectively for computers that are no longer connected to the network.
