## Problem Description
The customer reported a need for a patch related to Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify, identified as ADV-2024-002.

## Environment Details
The customer is operating on an older server version, specifically version 5402.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the vulnerability report (ADV-2024-002) to assess the impact on the customer's system.
2. Confirmed the server version in use by the customer.
3. Determined whether the patch was necessary based on the server version and vulnerability relevance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the inquiry was the identification of a vulnerability that the customer believed required immediate attention. However, it was found that the customer's server version (5402) did not necessitate the application of the patch.

## Solution
After confirming that the customer's server version was older and not affected by the reported vulnerabilities, it was concluded that the patch was not needed. The case was resolved by informing the customer that they could continue operating without applying the patch.

## Notes
- Customers using older versions of software may not be affected by newer vulnerabilities; always verify the version before recommending patches.
- Maintain awareness of the specific vulnerabilities and their applicability to different versions of software to provide accurate support.
