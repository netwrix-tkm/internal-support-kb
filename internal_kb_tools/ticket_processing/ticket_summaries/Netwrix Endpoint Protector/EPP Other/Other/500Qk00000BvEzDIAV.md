## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BvEzDIAV
- **Case Number:** 412076
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Klarna
- **Contact Name:** Deepti Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5940

## Problem Description
The customer reported duplicated logs for the same event, indicating that alerts were generated with identical timestamps, files, and destinations.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5940

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial acknowledgment of the issue by the support team.
2. Investigation into the nature of the duplicated logs, including reviewing screenshots provided by the customer.
3. Communication with engineering to understand the underlying cause of the duplication.
4. Suggested the customer verify the contents of the reported files to determine if the threats were indeed the same.
5. Follow-up discussions to clarify the nature of the logs and potential limitations in the reporting mechanism.

## Root Cause
The duplication of logs was attributed to a limitation in the reporting mechanism of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, where similar threats could be reported from different files (e.g., `sharedstrings.xml` and `sheet12.xml`). This was recognized as a known issue that the engineering team was aware of and planned to address in future updates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved with the release of version 5940, which included improvements to the log reporting mechanism. The customer confirmed that they observed an improvement in the log duplication issue after upgrading to this version.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to upgrade to the latest version of the software, as fixes for known issues are often included in updates.
- It is important to verify the contents of reported files when investigating log duplication to determine if the threats are genuinely identical or different.
