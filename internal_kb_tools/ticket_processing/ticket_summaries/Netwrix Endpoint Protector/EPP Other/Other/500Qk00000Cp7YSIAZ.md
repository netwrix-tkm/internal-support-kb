- **Case Number:** 414429
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoSoSys Korea
- **Contact Name:** Jack Jung
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported a discrepancy in the scheduled audit log backups between the Data Center (DC) and the Content Aware Protection (CAP) systems. Specifically, the DC backup logs contained one month's logs per pack, while the CAP backup logs included two months' logs per pack, leading to confusion among users.

## Environment Details
- **Backup Frequency:** Every month
- **Logs to Backup:** Older than 1 month
- **Average Number of Logs per Pack:** 1,000,000
- **EPP Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Customers Involved:** Cyberlogitec and Musina Payments

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the scheduled audit log settings for both DC and CAP.
2. Analyzed the backup logs for discrepancies in the log periods included.
3. Engaged in email communication with the customer to gather more details.
4. Proposed a remote session to investigate the issue further.
5. Scheduled a Zoom meeting with the customer to discuss the findings.

## Root Cause
The difference in log periods included in the backup packs was identified as a normal design feature of the system. The DC and CAP systems are configured to handle log backups differently, which was not clearly communicated to the customers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customers that the observed behavior was by design. The support team provided documentation and explanations regarding the differences in backup configurations between DC and CAP. A remote session was conducted to ensure the customers understood the backup processes.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate the differences in backup configurations clearly to customers to avoid confusion.
- Future support cases should include a review of the design specifications for backup processes to provide accurate information to customers.
