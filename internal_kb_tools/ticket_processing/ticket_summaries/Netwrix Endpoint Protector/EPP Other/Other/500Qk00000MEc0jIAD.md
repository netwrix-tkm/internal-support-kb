- **Case Number:** 436756
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Salmon Group Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Bogdan Panasiuk
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Salmon Group Ltd, requested assistance in replacing the default TLS certificates on their Netwrix Endpoint Protector virtual appliance with their own certificates. They sought SSH root access to automate the periodic renewal of these certificates using Certbot.

## Environment Details
- The Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server is hosted on an EC2 instance within the customer's AWS account.
- The customer intends to use Certbot and the Certbot plugin for AWS Route 53 for certificate management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's need for SSH access to automate TLS certificate renewal.
2. Discussed the implications of granting SSH root access, including the need for a legal agreement.
3. Provided information on how to manually import certificates under "Appliance" > "Server Maintenance."
4. Requested the customer to fill out a legal addendum for SSH access.
5. Explored alternative solutions, including the possibility of deploying an Nginx proxy for certificate management.

## Root Cause
The default TLS certificates were not suitable for the customer's needs, prompting the request for custom certificates and automation of their renewal process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to use a certificate with a longer validity period, which would reduce the frequency of manual renewals. The customer decided to implement this solution instead of pursuing SSH access.

## Notes
- Custom configurations to Nginx are not supported by Netwrix unless specifically related to port separation between the EPP Server UI and client-server communication.
- Future requests for SSH access should be accompanied by a signed legal agreement, and customers should be informed that they will be responsible for any changes made to the server.
