## Problem Description
A user reported experiencing delays when executing Git commands after a recent update to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). The commands would hang for 5-10 seconds, significantly impairing their workflow.

## Environment Details
- The issue was noted to occur specifically when Git was enabled on the Client Access Point (CAP).
- Logs from the user's computer and Git were collected for analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs from the user's computer and Git to analyze the delays.
2. Engaged with the user to gather specific Git commands that were causing the issue.
3. Investigated the impact of the EPP update on Git command execution.
4. Attempted to reproduce the issue with the latest EPP client version but could not replicate the delays.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the delays was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that enabling Git on the CAP led to performance issues for users.

## Solution
The issue could not be reproduced with the latest EPP client version. The user reported that they had not experienced the same delays since the initial report, suggesting that the problem may have been resolved with subsequent updates or changes.

## Notes
- Users experiencing similar issues should be advised to ensure they are using the latest version of the EPP client.
- If delays occur again, it is crucial to gather specific Git commands that trigger the issue for further analysis.
- Encourage users to monitor their performance and report any recurring issues promptly.
