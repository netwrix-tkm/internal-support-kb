- **Case Number:** 441093
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the EPP agent installed on two VDI endpoints. Only one endpoint was reflected in the management console at a time. When a manual update was performed on one endpoint, it appeared in the console, while the other disappeared. This behavior alternated between the two machines, indicating a potential conflict in identification or configuration.

## Environment Details
- Two VDI endpoints with the EPP agent installed.
- Management console for monitoring the endpoints.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial investigation into the agent registration and configuration settings.
2. Suggested the customer check the Server Configuration settings, specifically under Server Settings -> Virtual Desktop Clones.
3. Confirmed with the customer whether the Virtual Desktop Clones setting was enabled.
4. Requested the customer to test the endpoints after enabling the necessary settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a configuration problem where the Virtual Desktop Clones setting was not enabled. This caused the management console to only recognize one endpoint at a time.

## Solution
The customer enabled the Virtual Desktop Clones setting in the Server Configuration. After this change, both VDI endpoints were successfully reflected in the management console without any further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Virtual Desktop Clones setting is enabled when deploying EPP agents on multiple VDI endpoints to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for updates and configuration settings in the management console to maintain consistent agent registration.
