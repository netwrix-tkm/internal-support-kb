## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CGKYXIA5
- **Case Number:** 412902
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Catchpoint India
- **Contact Name:** Indu Shekhar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that several devices with the Endpoint Protector (EPP) installed via Intune were not appearing on the EPP dashboard, despite successful installation on the users' devices.

## Environment Details
- Endpoint Protector deployed via Microsoft Intune.
- Affected devices included both Mac and Windows platforms.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified connectivity to the EPP server using `ping` and `telnet` commands.
2. Checked the installed agent version on the affected machines (version 6.2.2.1.006).
3. Suggested using the `SetServerIP` tool to re-establish connection.
4. Instructed the customer to check client communication by navigating to the EPP client settings and using the `CTRL + ALT + I` key combination.
5. Conducted a remote session to review the Intune deployment process and settings.
6. Collected logs from the affected machines for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration during the deployment of the EPP client via Intune, which prevented the clients from receiving the correct server name and port due to a DNS issue.

## Solution
1. Uninstall the incorrectly configured EPP clients from the affected machines.
2. Redeploy the EPP clients using the correct configurations in the Intune deployment tool.
3. Confirmed that the policies were functioning correctly on Mac devices, while Windows devices required further investigation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP domain and URL are allowed through any proxy settings to avoid connectivity issues.
- The customer was advised to disregard notifications for the "EPP Server Hotfix #1.1" as it is a known issue that will be resolved in future server updates.
- Follow up with the customer to ensure that the redeployment resolves the issue on Windows devices.
