## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CZ71JIAT
- **Case Number:** 413738
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Diakonie Herzogsägmühle Peiting
- **Contact Name:** Michael Ebert
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 7.1

## Problem Description
The client reported that a specific endpoint was showing as offline on the server, despite being connected. The client was unable to establish a proper connection with the server, leading to concerns about the integrity of the server-client relationship.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a network environment utilizing Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The client had recently deployed a new Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) client.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested the client to uninstall and then reinstall the EPP client on the affected computer to restore the connection.
2. After the reinstallation, the client confirmed that the connection was re-established.
3. The support team discussed the possibility of identifying other clients that might be experiencing similar issues.
4. A suggestion was made to check the "Last Seen" column in the server interface to identify clients that had not communicated with the server recently.
5. The support engineer offered to perform a re-registration of the client from the server side and requested SSH access via Putty for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the server IP not being set correctly when the new EPP client was deployed. This misconfiguration prevented the server from recognizing and communicating with the client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the server IP was correctly configured. Once this was addressed, the clients began to reconnect to the server successfully. The client confirmed that the connections were re-established and that the clients were reporting back to the server as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the server IP is correctly configured during the deployment of new clients to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular monitoring of the "Last Seen" status of clients can help identify potential connectivity issues before they become critical.
- Consider implementing a routine check or alert system for clients that have not communicated with the server for an extended period.
