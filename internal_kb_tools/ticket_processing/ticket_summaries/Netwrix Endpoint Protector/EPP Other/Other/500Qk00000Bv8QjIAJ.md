## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to add comments or request updates on tickets that were set to "On Hold" status using the new support tool. Additionally, the "Provide Feedback" option was also non-functional.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5930

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the issue and communicated with the customer to gather more details.
2. Analyzed the functionality of the support tool regarding ticket status updates.
3. Investigated the "On Hold" status restrictions within the system.
4. Implemented a modification to the Salesforce (SF) configuration to address the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a restriction in the support tool's functionality that prevented users from interacting with tickets marked as "On Hold." This limitation affected the ability to provide feedback and request updates.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by modifying the Salesforce configuration, which allowed users to request updates on tickets that were previously set to "On Hold." After the modification, the tickets appeared with an "Open" status, enabling the desired interactions.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future modifications to ticket status functionalities are thoroughly tested to prevent similar issues.
- It is advisable to keep track of any changes made to the system configurations to facilitate easier troubleshooting in the future.
