## Problem Description
The customer, Daniel from HQLAx, requested to add a new email address (itsupport@hqla-x.com) to the list of recipients for Security Advisory emails sent from security-notifications@netwrix.com. The customer also inquired if there was a way to manage the list of users independently.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Product Version:** 5.9.4.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current configuration for email notifications associated with security-notifications@netwrix.com.
2. Verified the existing list of email recipients for Security Advisory notifications.
3. Checked for any available options within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector interface for managing email notifications.
4. Communicated with the customer regarding the process for adding new email addresses.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need to update the list of email recipients for security notifications, which was not initially clear if it could be managed independently by the users.

## Solution
The support team successfully added the requested email address (itsupport@hqla-x.com) to the notification list for Security Advisory emails. The customer was informed that they currently do not have the capability to manage the list of users independently and that any changes must be requested through support.

## Notes
- Future requests for adding or modifying email recipients for security notifications should be directed to Netwrix support, as user management for this feature is not available in the current version.
- It is advisable to document any changes made to notification settings for future reference and to inform customers about the limitations regarding self-management of notification lists.
