## Problem Description
The customer, Kamil Bednar from Fio Banka, inquired whether there is any root access to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server beyond the graphical user interface (GUI). They specifically requested SSH access to the server.

## Environment Details
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Access Method:** GUI only; SSH access is restricted.

## Troubleshooting Steps

5. The customer expressed concerns about accessing logs from the OS and how they appear in their SIEM.
6. Support recommended opening a new ticket for issues related to log content in the SIEM.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the customer's inquiry was a misunderstanding regarding the access capabilities of the EPP server. The company policy restricts SSH access to protect the integrity of the server and its functionality, which led to the customer's request for clarification.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that:
- SSH access is not available to customers.
- All administrative tasks can be performed through the User Interface.
- Support provided guidance on how to integrate EPP logs with their SIEM solution, including steps to forward logs and select log types.

## Notes
- Future requests for SSH access should be declined, reiterating the company's policy on access restrictions.
- If customers require assistance with log content in their SIEM, they should be advised to open a new support ticket with detailed information about the discrepancies they are experiencing.
