## Problem Description
The customer, Nexus, requested a quote for an additional 100 client licenses to increase their total from 800 to 900 licenses.

## Environment Details
- The request pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made with Carmen, who no longer handles these cases.
2. The request was redirected to Cristina Moldovan, who advised contacting Vlad Vladut.
3. The email was forwarded to Vlad Vladut, awaiting confirmation.
4. Follow-up communications were made with Nicoleta, who was tasked with reaching out to Ross for further details.
5. Nicoleta confirmed that Ross needed to discuss the license count with his manager before proceeding.
6. Multiple follow-ups were conducted with Nicoleta regarding the status of the request.
7. Nicoleta was out of the office until April 30, delaying further communication.
8. Final follow-up indicated that the client would raise another request once they decided on the license count.

## Root Cause
The delay in processing the license increase request was due to the need for internal discussions within the client's organization regarding the exact number of licenses required.

## Solution
The ticket was closed with the understanding that the client, Nexus, would submit a new request once they finalized their decision on the license count. No immediate action was required from Netwrix at this time.

## Notes
- Ensure to keep track of the client's internal decision-making process when handling license requests.
- Future requests for license increases should be directed to the appropriate sales representatives to expedite the quoting process.
- Maintain clear communication with the client to avoid delays in follow-up and confirmation.
