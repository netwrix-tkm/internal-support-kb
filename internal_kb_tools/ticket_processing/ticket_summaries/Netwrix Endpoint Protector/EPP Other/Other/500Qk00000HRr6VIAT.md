## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to restrict the WebUI to port 8443, indicating that this configuration needed to be made in the Nginx configuration file.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer required port separation configuration.

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to implement the necessary changes.
3. Informed the customer to take a snapshot of the current configuration before proceeding with the changes.
4. Conducted the configuration changes during the remote session.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to configure the Nginx server to restrict the WebUI to a specific port (8443) as part of the customer's security requirements.

## Solution
The port separation was successfully configured during a remote session with the customer. The Nginx configuration file was updated to restrict access to port 8443, and the changes were verified to ensure proper functionality.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to take a snapshot of their current configurations before making significant changes to avoid potential issues.
- Future requests for port separation should follow a similar process of confirming requirements, scheduling remote sessions, and ensuring backups are taken beforehand.
