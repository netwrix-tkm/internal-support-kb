## Problem Description
The customer reported that their server, created two weeks prior, was no longer accessible. They were unable to open the site or establish an SSH session in AWS, despite having restarted the server.

## Environment Details
- The server was hosted on AWS.
- The issue was observed on multiple devices, including laptops and PCs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the server was down and requested a remote session.
2. Verified that services were up and running on the server.
3. Checked disk space and confirmed it was not fully occupied.
4. Noted that the server was accessible from the customer's phone, indicating a potential network issue.
5. Observed that the UI was accessible on the customer's phone and the support technician's PC, but not on the customer's laptops.
6. Customer redeployed the server and checked internally for any network blocks affecting the UI.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being on the customer's side, specifically related to their AWS network configuration, which was blocking access from certain devices.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by the customer adjusting their internal network settings to allow access to the server from laptops. The support technician confirmed that the UI was accessible after these changes were made.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers check their network configurations when experiencing access issues, especially if the server is accessible from some devices but not others.
- Recommend documenting any changes made to network settings for future reference.
