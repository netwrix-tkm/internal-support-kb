## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MtkK8IAJ
- **Case Number:** 438729
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Compass Solutions
- **Contact Name:** Jose Alberto Ramirez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about how to change the default "Priority" value of a newly created group in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which is set to "999" upon creation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request regarding the inability to change the default priority value of groups.
2. Confirmed that the priority value is not editable directly after group creation.
3. Provided guidance on how to change the priority by using the drag-and-drop feature in the Device Control -> Groups section.

## Root Cause
The default priority value of "999" for groups in Netwrix Endpoint Protector is a fixed setting that cannot be edited directly. Instead, the priority can only be adjusted by rearranging the groups in the interface.

## Solution
To change the priority of a group:
- Navigate to **Device Control -> Groups**.
- Select the desired group.
- Use the drag-and-drop functionality to position the group above or below another group, which will effectively change its priority.

## Notes
- The inability to edit the priority value directly is a known limitation of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector system.
- Users should be aware of the drag-and-drop method for adjusting group priorities to avoid confusion in future cases.
