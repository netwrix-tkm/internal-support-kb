- **Case Number:** 419303
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where multiple computers that had been formatted (reset) were still occupying licenses on the server. The computers were identified by the same name, making it difficult to determine which license to release.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the license allocation on the server.
2. Attempted to identify the specific computers occupying the licenses based on their names.
3. Conducted a remote session to investigate the issue further.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the formatted computers retained their license allocations on the server due to their identical names, which prevented easy identification and management of the licenses.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by releasing the licenses during a remote session. This action cleared the licenses associated with the formatted computers, allowing for proper management of the remaining licenses.

## Notes
- Ensure that computers are assigned unique names to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review license allocations to identify and release licenses from devices that are no longer in use.
