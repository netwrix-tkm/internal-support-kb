- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** LayaTech

## Problem Description
The customer, LayaTech, reported that they had forgotten their CoSoSys DLP web console login password and requested assistance to reset it.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer needed access to the backend of the EPP server to perform the password reset.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Contact:** The support team acknowledged the request and asked to schedule a remote session to access the backend of the EPP server.
2. **Remote Session Scheduling:** Multiple attempts were made to schedule a remote session, with various times proposed by both the customer and the support team.
3. **Connectivity Issues:** During the first scheduled session, the support team was unable to access the backend due to connectivity issues.
4. **SSH Access:** The support team advised the customer to ensure that SSH access was allowed for the EPP server.
5. **Follow-Up:** After the customer confirmed that the SSH connectivity issue was resolved, a new session was scheduled.

## Root Cause
The initial inability to reset the password was due to connectivity issues that prevented access to the backend of the EPP server. This was resolved by ensuring that SSH access was properly configured.

## Solution
- A successful remote session was conducted after the SSH connectivity issue was fixed.
- The support engineer reset the root password for the EPP web console during this session.
- The customer confirmed that the password was successfully changed, and the case was closed.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSH access is configured correctly before scheduling remote sessions for backend access in future cases.
- Always confirm with the customer that they have resolved any connectivity issues prior to the scheduled session to avoid delays.
