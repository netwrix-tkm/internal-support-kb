## Problem Description
The customer reported that licenses were not being released after a set time frame, leading to over licensing issues. Additionally, new systems being deployed with agents were not checking in, raising concerns about whether these issues were related.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was deploying new systems and agents.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer confirmed that the license release settings were configured correctly.
2. The support team reviewed the backend procedures related to license management.
3. A callback was attempted, but the number did not exist.
4. A SQL update command was executed to reset trial versions for client machines without assigned licenses:
   ```sql
   UPDATE clientmachine 
   LEFT JOIN license ON clientmachine.id = license.assigned_to 
   SET clientmachine.trialversion = NULL 
   WHERE license.id IS NULL AND clientmachine.deleted = 0
   ```

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a backend procedure issue that was affecting the license release functionality. This was confirmed to be related to the license management system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing a backend procedure provided by the server team, which had previously fixed a similar issue in another case. The customer confirmed that the licenses were now maintaining correctly, and the new systems were able to check in as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that backend procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the license release settings closely, especially when deploying new systems and agents.
- Maintain clear communication with the customer regarding troubleshooting steps and resolutions to ensure transparency and satisfaction.
