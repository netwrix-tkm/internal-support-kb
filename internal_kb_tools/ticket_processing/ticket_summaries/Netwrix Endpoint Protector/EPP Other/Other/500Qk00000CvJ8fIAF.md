## Problem Description
The customer reported that the status logs for Content Aware Protection (CAP) were either not being generated or were being generated incorrectly during operations.

## Environment Details
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the EPP server version and Ubuntu version.
2. Attempted to generate multiple CAP policies and toggled their status (ON/OFF).
3. Checked the logs under 'Reports and Analysis > Admin Actions' for any entries.
4. Created a second CAP policy with the same settings to see if the issue persisted.
5. Reviewed video evidence provided by the customer demonstrating the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a bug in the EPP version 5.9.3.0, which prevented the proper generation of logs for CAP status changes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the EPP to version 5.9.4.1, which included a fix for the logging functionality related to CAP policies. CoSoSys Korea confirmed that the fix was successful after the upgrade.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are advised to upgrade to version 5.9.4.1 or later to avoid similar issues with CAP logging.
- Always verify the server version and operating system details when troubleshooting logging issues.
