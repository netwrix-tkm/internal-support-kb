## Problem Description
The customer had several queries regarding the functionality of the Cososys Endpoint Protector (EPP) in relation to their Single Sign-On (SSO) platform, file transfer restrictions, and mobile file sharing applications.

## Environment Details
- The customer is utilizing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector in conjunction with their existing IT infrastructure, which includes Azure AD and OKTA for SSO.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed compatibility of the Endpoint Protector Server with Azure AD and OKTA SSO.
2. Instructed the customer to select the FTP option in the CAP policy for blocking FTP file transfers.
3. Advised checking the CAP policy to ensure that the relevant applications are included in the exit points list for monitoring.
4. Discussed the possibility of blocking file sharing applications like Xender and ShareIt by suggesting complete Wi-Fi blocking from Device Control.

## Root Cause
The queries stemmed from the customer's need to understand how to effectively manage file transfers and sharing through their existing security policies, particularly concerning mobile applications and SSO integration.

## Solution
- Provided information confirming that the Endpoint Protector Server works with Azure AD and OKTA SSO.
- Guided the customer on how to configure the CAP policy to block FTP file transfers and monitor applications for file sharing.
- Clarified that the only method to prevent file sharing via mobile applications was to block Wi-Fi access completely from Device Control.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all applications intended for monitoring are included in the CAP policy exit points to effectively manage file transfers.
- Future inquiries regarding mobile application file sharing should consider the limitations of the current Device Control features, particularly the need for complete Wi-Fi blocking to prevent unauthorized file sharing.
