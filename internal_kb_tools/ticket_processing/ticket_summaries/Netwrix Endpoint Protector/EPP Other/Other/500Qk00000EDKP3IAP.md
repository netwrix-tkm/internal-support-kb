## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, including:

3. Content Aware policy not functioning on a Linux machine.

## Environment Details
- **Linux Version:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Agent Version:** EPPClient_v2.4.2.1006

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the printer was selected in the Content Aware Policy and that the “Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning” setting was enabled.
2. Rebooted the system to see if the issue persisted.
3. Checked the logs for Content Aware Reports to identify any errors.
4. Confirmed that the Content Aware Policy was active and applied to the Linux machine.
5. Tested USB blocking and whitelisting on the Linux machine, which worked successfully.
6. Reviewed the server resources and logs as per the escalation process.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issues was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was noted that all logs from workers were processed, indicating that the system was functioning correctly after the remote session.

## Solution
The issues were resolved after conducting a remote session where the necessary checks were performed. The Content Aware Policy was confirmed to be functioning correctly post-session, and the logs were processed successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that all relevant policies are correctly configured and active before troubleshooting.
- Regularly check server resources and logs to preemptively identify potential issues.
- For future cases, consider performing remote sessions to diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.
