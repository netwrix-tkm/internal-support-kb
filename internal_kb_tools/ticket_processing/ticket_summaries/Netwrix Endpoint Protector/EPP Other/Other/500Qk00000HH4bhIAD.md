- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baader Bank
- **Contact Name:** Florian Wolfschaffner
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to start the appliance, which resulted in a non-bootable server.

## Environment Details
- **Error Message:** `cifs_mount failed w/return code= -2`
- **Age of the appliance:** 16.2 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to boot the appliance but encountered the error message indicating a failure in the CIFS mount process.
2. The support team communicated with the customer to gather more information and check if further assistance was needed.
3. The customer requested a new download link for the necessary tool, as the previous link had expired.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case details. However, the error message suggests a problem with the CIFS (Common Internet File System) mount, which could be related to network connectivity or configuration issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully migrating a new EPP (Endpoint Protector) image to the appliance. After the migration, the appliance was able to boot successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that download links for tools are valid and not expired to prevent delays in troubleshooting.
- Monitor the appliance's boot process after updates or migrations to confirm successful operation.
- Future cases involving CIFS mount failures may require checking network configurations and connectivity as part of the troubleshooting process.
