## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J5JFCIA3
- **Case Number:** 428810
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Accesa IT Systems SRL
- **Contact Name:** Accesa IT System
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while attempting to apply backend updates for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The updates consistently failed to progress and remained stuck at the "applying update" stage. This issue was noted to be similar to a previous incident documented under ticket ID 00420100.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Disk Space:** Verified if the root partition in the backend was full or over 30%.
2. **Free Space Check:** Executed the command `df -h` to check the free space of the `/boot` partition.
3. **Fix Broken Packages:** Ran `dpkg --configure -a` to fix any broken package configurations from previous failed upgrades.
4. **Kernel Version Check:** Noted the version of the currently running kernel using `uname -r`.
5. **Remove Old Kernels:** Executed a command to remove all but the currently running kernel packages:
   ```bash
   apt-get remove --purge `dpkg -l | grep linux | egrep -e 'linux-generic|linux-headers|linux-hwe|linux-image|linux-modules' | grep -v $(uname -r) | awk '{print $2}'`
   ```
6. **Install New Kernel:** Installed the `linux-generic-hwe-22.04` kernel and rebooted the system:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get --no-install-recommends install linux-generic-hwe-22.04
   reboot
   ```
7. **Remove Old Kernel Packages:** Removed all packages related to the old kernel version noted earlier.
   ```bash
   apt-get remove --purge `dpkg -l | grep linux | awk '{print $2}' | grep <old-kernel-version>`
   ```
8. **Final Reboot:** Rebooted the system and verified that the EPP server was operational.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by insufficient disk space on the root partition, which prevented the backend updates from applying successfully. The presence of broken package configurations from previous failed updates also contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a series of steps to free up disk space, fix broken package configurations, and update the kernel. This involved removing old kernel packages, installing a new kernel, and ensuring that the system had adequate resources to apply the updates successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that sufficient disk space is available on the root partition before attempting updates to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for and resolve any broken package configurations to maintain system stability.
- Document any similar incidents and resolutions to streamline future troubleshooting efforts.
