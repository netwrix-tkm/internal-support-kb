## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Dv6E7IAJ
- **Case Number:** 416923
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** LayaTech
- **Contact Name:** Rajesh Krish
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue in the DLP portal where password expiration pop-ups were appearing. Attempts to change the password resulted in an error message stating, "The password provided is different from the existing password," even when the correct password was entered.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the password expiration status in the DLP portal.
2. Attempted to change the password using the web portal multiple times.
3. Checked for any known issues or updates related to password management in the DLP portal.
4. Reviewed user permissions and roles to ensure proper access for password changes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during troubleshooting. However, it was determined that the password change could not be processed through the web portal due to a potential backend synchronization issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the password directly from the backend. This bypassed the web portal's limitations and allowed the user to regain access without further complications.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor for similar issues in the future, as they may indicate a recurring backend synchronization problem.
- Ensure that users are aware of the process for password changes, including the possibility of backend intervention if the web portal fails.
- Consider implementing additional logging or alerts for password change failures to facilitate quicker resolutions in similar cases.
