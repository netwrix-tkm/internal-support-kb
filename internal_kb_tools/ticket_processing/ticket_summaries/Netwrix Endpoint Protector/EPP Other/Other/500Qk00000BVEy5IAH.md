- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requested access to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) product through the portal for a user, Reece Evans. They needed to ensure that the user could access the EPP licensed software.

## Environment Details
- The system is air-gapped, requiring offline access to software updates and license files.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the request for user access to the EPP product.
2. Requested user details (name, email, position) from the customer to set up access.
3. Informed the customer about creating an account on the Netwrix portal.
4. Provided links to the support reference guide for further assistance.
5. Addressed follow-up inquiries regarding access to product downloads and license keys.
6. Provided instructions for migrating data from the old server to the new server using System Backup v2.
7. Supplied offline patches for upgrading the EPP server version.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the lack of access to the EPP product on the portal for the user, which was due to the account not being properly set up or linked to the existing license.

## Solution
- Created an account for Reece Evans on the Netwrix portal and provided access to the EPP product.
- Instructed the customer on how to download the latest versions and updates of EPP, including offline patches necessary for their air-gapped environment.
- Provided detailed steps for migrating the license from the old server to the new server.

## Notes
- Ensure that all users needing access to the EPP product have their accounts properly set up and linked to the correct licenses.
- For air-gapped systems, always provide offline patch links and instructions for software updates.
- Advise customers to create VM snapshots before applying any updates to ensure a restore point is available in case of issues.
