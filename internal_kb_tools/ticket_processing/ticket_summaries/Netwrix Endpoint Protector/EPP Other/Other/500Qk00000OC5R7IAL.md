## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with upgrading the Endpoint Protector (EPP) version from 5.9.3.5 to 6.2.2.2. The machines were not reporting to the EPP server, preventing the installation of the new version.

## Environment Details
- The machines were showing as "unlicensed" in the EPP system.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to uninstall the older version using the EPP uninstallation password, but received an "invalid password" error.
2. Tried to uninstall the application from the software center using the IP uninstall app, which resulted in an error (details attached to the ticket).
3. Directly attempted to install the new version (6.2.2.2), but the installation failed (error screenshot attached).
4. Used the EPP removal script, but the process got stuck and did not complete.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the machines not being properly licensed and reporting to the EPP server, which hindered the upgrade process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the machines were properly licensed and configured to report to the EPP server. After confirming the licensing status and making necessary adjustments, the upgrade to version 6.2.2.2 was successfully completed.

## Notes
- Ensure that machines are properly licensed and reporting to the EPP server before attempting upgrades.
- If encountering "invalid password" errors during uninstallation, verify the password and consider resetting it if necessary.
- Always check for any pending updates or configurations that may affect the upgrade process.
