## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Backend Security Updates could not be installed via the Web-GUI.

## Environment Details
The customer confirmed they are hosted on-premises.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed with the customer that they are hosted on-premises.
2. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue.
3. Removed unnecessary space on the server.
4. Updated the kernel of the system.
5. Applied the latest Ubuntu updates.
6. Attempted to apply the backend security updates again.

## Root Cause
The initial failure to apply the backend security updates was likely due to insufficient disk space and an outdated kernel, which prevented the updates from being installed successfully.

## Solution
After removing unnecessary disk space and updating the kernel along with applying the Ubuntu updates, the backend security updates were successfully applied.

## Notes
- Ensure that there is adequate disk space available before attempting to apply security updates.
- Regularly update the system kernel and other dependencies to avoid similar issues in the future.
