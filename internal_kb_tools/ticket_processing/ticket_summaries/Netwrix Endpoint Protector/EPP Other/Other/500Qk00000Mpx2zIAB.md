## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to download patches for their Netwrix Endpoint Protector appliance and noted that previous patch applications did not result in an increase in the version number.

## Environment Details
- Current appliance version prior to updates: 5.8.1.0
- Customer was attempting to update to the latest version: 5.9.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the current appliance version with the customer.
2. Inquired about any errors displayed in "Dashboard > Live Update".
3. Provided a list of offline patches available for download.
4. Suggested creating a VM snapshot before applying updates.
5. Instructed the customer to apply patches one at a time, waiting 10-20 minutes between each patch.
6. Provided direct links to the required offline patches for each version increment.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's appliance being on an outdated version (5.8.1.0) and not having access to the necessary patches for upgrading. The previous patch applications did not reflect in the version number due to improper installation or lack of required updates.

## Solution
The customer successfully applied all the provided patches in the correct order, resulting in the appliance being updated to version 5.9.4.1. The steps included:
- Uploading each patch via "Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch Uploader".
- Waiting for confirmation of each patch's installation before proceeding to the next.

## Notes
- Always ensure that a VM snapshot is created before applying updates to allow for rollback in case of issues.
- It is crucial to apply patches sequentially and allow sufficient time for each to install properly.
- Customers should be advised to check for any errors in the "Live Update" section if they encounter issues with patch applications.
