## Problem Description
The customer, Jovan Salsone, requested assistance in locating proof of encryption at rest within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) environment. Specifically, he needed a screenshot demonstrating that a policy enforcing encryption at rest was in place for an upcoming audit.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific feature in question relates to enforced encryption policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial inquiry sent to the customer to clarify the specific requirements for the screenshot.
2. Customer clarified the need for evidence of a policy that ensures encryption at rest is enforced.
3. Suggested checking the eDiscovery module in the EPP UI, which the customer later confirmed was not part of their suite.

## Root Cause
The customer was unaware of the specific features available in their version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, particularly regarding the enforced encryption settings and how to access them.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to the correct section of the EPP web interface where they could verify the enforced encryption settings. The following steps were provided:
- Navigate to **Enforce Encryption > EasyLock** in the EPP web interface to check the setup.
- Confirm the automatic deployment of encryption on USB storage devices by checking the rights set for these devices:
  - At the global level: **Device Control > Global Rights**
  - For granular settings: **Device Control > Groups/ Computers/ Users > right-click on the entity > manage Rights**

Additionally, documentation links were provided to assist the customer in understanding the functionality of enforced encryption.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be aware of the features included in their specific licensing of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, as not all features may be available.
- Future inquiries regarding proof of encryption should include a check of the specific modules available to the customer to streamline the support process.
