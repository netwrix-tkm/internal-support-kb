## Problem Description
The customer reported two main issues:
1. Users who were granted access to WhatsApp were unable to open the application, while those who should be blocked were also experiencing the same restriction.
2. A specific user was supposed to have Gmail, external mail access, and file uploads blocked, but they were still able to access Gmail and upload files.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified user permissions and access settings for WhatsApp.
2. Checked the configuration for blocking Gmail and file uploads for the specific user.
3. Reviewed logs to identify any discrepancies in access control.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue with test accounts to confirm the behavior.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the access control settings within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The settings intended to restrict access to WhatsApp and block Gmail/file uploads were not applied correctly, leading to unintended access.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Correcting the access control settings for WhatsApp to ensure that only designated users could access the application.
2. Updating the configuration for the specific user to effectively block Gmail and file uploads as intended.
3. Conducting a thorough review of all user permissions to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review and verify access control settings to ensure they are applied correctly.
- Consider implementing a testing phase for configuration changes to catch potential issues before they affect end users.
- Document any changes made to user permissions for future reference and troubleshooting.
