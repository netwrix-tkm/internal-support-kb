## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hr0rLIAR
- **Case Number:** 425895
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ansaldo Nuclear Ltd
- **Contact Name:** John Willcox
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating the Main Administrator email address on the server, the EPP clients still displayed the old email address. They sought assistance on how to force the clients to update this information.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a deployment of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) across multiple PCs within the organization.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the email address had been updated on the server.
2. Informed the customer that EPP clients should update automatically upon checking in with the server for policy updates.
3. Monitored the update process on client machines to verify if the changes were reflected.
4. Collected feedback from the customer regarding the update timing on their devices.

## Root Cause
The delay in the clients reflecting the updated email address was due to the time taken for the clients to check in with the server and apply the new policy. Some machines took longer than others to update, which led to confusion about whether the changes had been applied correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer confirmed that all client machines eventually updated to reflect the new email address after a delay of up to four hours. No further action was required as the clients updated automatically once they checked in with the server.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that changes may not be immediate and can take some time to propagate across all client machines.
- Encourage customers to monitor the update process and confirm that all clients have successfully updated after a reasonable period.
- For future cases, if clients do not update after a significant delay, consider collecting logs for further investigation.
