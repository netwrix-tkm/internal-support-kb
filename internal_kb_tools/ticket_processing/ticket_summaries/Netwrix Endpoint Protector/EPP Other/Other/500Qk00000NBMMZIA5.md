## Problem Description
The customer was testing client-to-server communication outside their premises without configuring the SSL pass-through option. They requested network design information regarding SSL cipher configuration and how to modify headers to facilitate communication between the server and client.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved client-server communication using TLS protocol.
- The customer was attempting to establish this communication without SSL offloading.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Emailed the customer to gather more information.
2. Followed up with a phone call to confirm details.
3. Raised the issue internally with the R&D team for documentation and guidance.
4. Sought input from the Teams solution-engineer channel regarding SSL configurations.

## Root Cause
The root cause identified was that the Netwrix Endpoint Protector does not support SSL offloading for client-server communication. The SSL pass-through must be enabled for successful communication.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that SSL offloading is not supported and that they must allow SSL pass-through for the client-server communication to function correctly. This information was communicated through email and confirmed during a follow-up call.

## Notes
- It is important to note that SSL offloading is not supported in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector environment.
- Future inquiries regarding SSL configurations should emphasize the necessity of SSL pass-through to avoid similar issues.
