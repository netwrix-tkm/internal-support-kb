## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to update their Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) to the latest stable version.

## Environment Details
- The upgrade process involved applying the 5940 offline patch.
- The appliance encountered an issue during the upgrade, getting stuck at 66% during the power-on process.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initiated a remote session to apply the 5940 offline patch.
2. Observed that the appliance got stuck at 66% during the boot process.
3. Advised the customer to restore a backup taken 13 hours prior to the upgrade attempt.
4. Planned to reapply the patch after the backup restoration.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified, but it was indicated that the appliance became unresponsive during the upgrade process, leading to the need for a backup restoration.

## Solution
The upgrade process was ultimately successful after the customer restored the backup and reapplied the 5940 offline patch. Confirmation was received that everything was functioning correctly by the following Friday.

## Notes
- Ensure that backups are taken before applying patches or upgrades to prevent data loss.
- Monitor the appliance closely during the upgrade process to catch any issues early.
- Future upgrades should be tested in a controlled environment if possible to mitigate risks.
