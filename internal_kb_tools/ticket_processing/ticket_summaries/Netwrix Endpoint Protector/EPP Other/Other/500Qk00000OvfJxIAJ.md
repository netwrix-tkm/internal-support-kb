## Problem Description
The customer, PwC, reported issues while migrating their Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) appliance from on-premises ESXi hosts to Hyper-V. The new virtual machine (VM) created on Hyper-V was unable to connect to the network.

## Environment Details
- Original deployment was on ESXi.
- Customer is transitioning to Hyper-V or potentially Azure for their EPP deployment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer inquired about the deployment process for Hyper-V and Azure.
2. Support provided the customer with deployment guides for both Hyper-V and Azure.
3. A download link for the EPP server image was sent to the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the network connectivity issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was implied that the customer was looking for a similar deployment method for Hyper-V as was used for ESXi, which may have contributed to the confusion during the migration process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed deployment instructions for both Hyper-V and Azure. This included:
- Clear guidance on how to deploy the EPP server image on Hyper-V.
- Ensuring the customer had the necessary resources and documentation to successfully complete the migration.

## Notes
- It is important for customers migrating from ESXi to Hyper-V to understand the differences in deployment processes and network configurations.
- Future support interactions should ensure that customers are aware of the specific requirements and configurations needed for successful deployment on different platforms.
