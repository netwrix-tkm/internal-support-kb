- **Case Number:** 425860
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BioCatch
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Itenberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with client-server communication after rolling out the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client to Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) machines via Intune. Although installations were successful, the client could not communicate with the server due to firewall restrictions.

## Environment Details
- The EPP client was deployed to AVD machines.
- The server URL provided was `https://xrdsqnc.hosted.endpointprotector.com/`.
- The customer indicated that SSL termination was not configured.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that TCP communication on port 443 was allowed from AVD machines to the server.
2. Advised the customer to check for SSL termination on the AVD firewall.
3. Provided the customer with the server's IP address (18.193.251.168) and an additional IP (213.233.64.23) to allow through the firewall.
4. Suggested checking the EPP client settings to ensure the server IP was correctly displayed.
5. Recommended manual installation of the EPP client on an AVD machine to verify communication.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the firewall configuration, which did not allow the necessary traffic on port 443 for the EPP client to communicate with the server. Additionally, the server domain may not have been set correctly on the client.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Opening the necessary ports (TCP 443) in the AVD firewall.
- Ensuring that the EPP client was configured with the correct server address using the provided server tool.
- The customer confirmed that after these adjustments, the EPP clients were successfully communicating with the server.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSL termination is not enabled on the firewall for port 443 to avoid communication issues.
- Always verify that the server domain is correctly set on the client to facilitate proper communication.
- For future deployments, consider documenting the necessary firewall rules and server configurations to streamline the setup process.
