## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to perform a mandatory password change after logging into the application with the initial password (root). Although the password was accepted at the login screen, it was subsequently marked as incorrect when attempting to change it.

## Environment Details
- The specific server version and operating system were not provided by the customer.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team communicated with the customer to gather more details about the issue.
2. A remote session was proposed to assist the customer directly.
3. The password was reset by the support team to allow the customer to attempt logging in again.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a problem with the password change functionality, which prevented the user from successfully changing the password after the initial login.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the password. After the reset, the customer was able to log in successfully and perform the mandatory password change without further issues.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the password reset process is clearly communicated to users, especially when they encounter issues with mandatory password changes.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should be advised to reset their passwords and verify the functionality immediately after logging in.
