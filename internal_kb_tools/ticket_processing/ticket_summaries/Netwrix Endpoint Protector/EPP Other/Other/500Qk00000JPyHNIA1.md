## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JPyHNIA1
- **Case Number:** 429677
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liebherr Group Turkey
- **Contact Name:** Enver Atasever
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5940

## Problem Description
The Liebherr Group Turkey team reported an issue with Active Directory (AD) connection, where some laptops were not recognized in the CoSoSys system. As a result, even though the Netwrix client was installed, it allowed access to all devices instead of enforcing the "Deny Access" right.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Environment:** Active Directory integrated with Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- **Client Installation:** Netwrix client installed on laptops.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the AD connection settings to ensure proper binding.
2. Attempted to bind the EPP server to the AD.
3. Communicated with the customer to gather additional details regarding their AD setup.
4. Advised the customer to check with their AD team for further assistance.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure to bind the EPP server to the Active Directory, which resulted in certain laptops not being recognized in the CoSoSys system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with instructions on how to properly install the Netwrix client through System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). This ensured that all devices were correctly recognized and that the "Deny Access" right was enforced.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the EPP server is correctly bound to the Active Directory to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to verify their AD configurations and ensure that all necessary devices are included in the CoSoSys system for proper access control.
