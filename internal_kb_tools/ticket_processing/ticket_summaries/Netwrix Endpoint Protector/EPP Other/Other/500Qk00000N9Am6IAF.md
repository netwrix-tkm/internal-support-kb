## Problem Description
The customer, Warwick Investment Group, requested 25 additional cotermed Device Control for Windows licenses for their Netwrix Endpoint Protector application.

## Environment Details
- The request was made by the application owner for Netwrix EPP.
- The customer is currently managing their licenses and is looking to add more to their existing agreement.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The initial request was acknowledged by the support team.
2. The Account Manager (AM) was involved to facilitate the license request.
3. Communication was established between the customer and the support team to clarify the request.
4. The customer expressed interest in a quote for an additional 50 licenses.
5. The AM worked out the license request outside of the ticket, indicating that the request was being handled through internal processes.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for additional licenses due to their growing requirements for Device Control for Windows. There was no technical malfunction; rather, it was a straightforward request for additional licensing.

## Solution
The Account Manager successfully processed the request for the additional 25 cotermed licenses outside of the ticketing system. The customer was informed and a quote for the additional licenses was prepared, which included the option to coterm with their current licenses.

## Notes
- Ensure that future requests for additional licenses are communicated clearly and involve the appropriate Account Manager to expedite the process.
- It is advisable to confirm whether the customer prefers to add new licenses to their upcoming renewal or handle them separately, as this can affect billing and license management.
- Maintain clear communication with the customer throughout the process to ensure their needs are met promptly.
