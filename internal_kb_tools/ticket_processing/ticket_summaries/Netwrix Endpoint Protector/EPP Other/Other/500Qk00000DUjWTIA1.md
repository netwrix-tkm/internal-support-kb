## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DUjWTIA1
- **Case Number:** 415964
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ultra Electronics TCS
- **Contact Name:** Nicholas Schubert
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5940

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying the latest security update, which confirmed successful installation, the update still appeared in the list of available updates. This raised concerns about whether the update was actually applied or if it was a display issue.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the application of the security update through the system interface.
2. Checked the update logs for any errors or warnings during the installation process.
3. Reviewed disk space availability to ensure there was sufficient space for the update.
4. Attempted to reapply the security update to see if the issue persisted.
5. Increased disk space by 200GB to rule out space-related issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to insufficient disk space, which prevented the update from being fully applied or recognized by the system, despite the confirmation of a successful installation.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Updating the server to version 5940.
- Increasing the disk space by 200GB, which allowed the system to properly recognize the applied security update and remove it from the list of available updates.

## Notes
- Ensure that there is adequate disk space before applying updates to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly monitor the update logs for any discrepancies or errors during the update process.
