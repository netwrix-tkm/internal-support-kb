- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they forwarded EPP logs to their SIEM from the EPP server but were unable to see any details related to the violations committed. Specifically, they did not receive any files or content associated with the SIEM incident. They requested an API for the EPP to integrate with the SIEM for further investigation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other
- **Age of the Issue:** 7.1 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the EPP logs forwarded to the SIEM.
2. Confirmed the absence of violation details in the SIEM incident reports.
3. Discussed the need for an API to facilitate data integration between EPP and SIEM.
4. Provided information regarding the API and its documentation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the lack of an appropriate API for the EPP that would allow for seamless integration with the SIEM, preventing the transfer of detailed violation data.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the necessary API and its documentation, enabling them to integrate the EPP with their SIEM effectively. This integration allowed for the retrieval of detailed data needed for incident investigation.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the API availability for future integrations with SIEM.
- Recommend regular checks on the integration to confirm that all relevant data is being captured and reported correctly.
