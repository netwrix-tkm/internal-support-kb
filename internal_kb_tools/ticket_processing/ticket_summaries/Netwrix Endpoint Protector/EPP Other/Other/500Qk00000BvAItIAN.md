- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** iMerit Technology Services Pvt. Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Bharat Jha
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** 5930

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their license, which was supposed to expire on June 12, 2024, was showing an updated expiration date of June 12, 2026. They requested assistance in finding logs related to this unexpected renewal.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5930

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial acknowledgment of the issue by the support team.
2. Investigation into the logs related to the license renewal in the EPP UI, which yielded no relevant information.
3. Internal escalation to the Legal team and Customer Success for further analysis.
4. Communication with the customer to keep them informed of the progress.

## Root Cause
The license renewal was due to an existing multi-year contract that iMerit Technology Services had in place, which extended the license validity until June 2026. This information was not initially clear to the customer.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that their account was under a multi-year contract, which automatically updated the license expiration date. The Customer Success team provided this clarification after reviewing the account details.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are informed about the terms of their contracts to prevent confusion regarding license renewals.
- Maintain clear communication with internal teams (Legal and Customer Success) for cases involving contract-related inquiries.
- Document any similar cases for future reference to streamline the resolution process.
