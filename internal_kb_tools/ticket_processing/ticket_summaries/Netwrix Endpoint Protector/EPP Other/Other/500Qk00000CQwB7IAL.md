## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying a vulnerability patch, no reports were being received on the server, despite policies being active and blocking actions.

## Environment Details
- The customer did not create a snapshot before applying the patch, which was recommended.
- The specific server version and hosting environment details were not provided initially.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that there were no known issues related to the vulnerability patch affecting log reception.
2. Advised the customer to ensure that the agent was upgraded to the fixed version.
3. Requested logs from the customer to analyze the issue further.
4. Set up a remote session to gather more information if needed.
5. Followed up with the customer for additional details regarding the server version, environment hosting, patch application method, and client version used.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the failure to upgrade the agent to the fixed version after the vulnerability patch was applied. This led to the logs not being sent to the server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a hotfix (adv-2024-002) that addressed the log reception problem. The customer was instructed to upgrade their agent to this fixed version to ensure proper functionality.

## Notes
- It is crucial for customers to create snapshots before applying significant patches to allow for easy rollback if issues arise.
- Always verify that the agent is updated to the latest version after applying patches to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Ensure to gather comprehensive environment details upfront to expedite troubleshooting.
