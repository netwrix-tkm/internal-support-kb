- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with creating a policy in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically when attempting to assign it to a specific group. The system prompted an error message stating: "Currently the system is using both computer and user rights, computer rights have priority."

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered while using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was utilizing the Ubuntu 22.04 client.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the rights application process within the system.
2. Discussed the implications of using both computer and user rights.
3. Provided guidance on setting alerts for file copying to USB devices through the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
4. Shared the link to download the Ubuntu 22.04 client for potential updates or reinstallation:
   ```
   https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_ubuntu_22.04_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the system's configuration, which prioritized computer rights over user rights when both were applied. This conflict prevented the successful assignment of the policy to the specified group.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying how rights are applied within the system. The customer was advised to ensure that the correct rights were assigned based on their policy requirements. Additionally, the customer was informed about the ability to set alerts for file copying activities, which could help in monitoring and managing rights effectively.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand the implications of using both computer and user rights in policy creation to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that the latest version of the client is being used to minimize compatibility issues.
- Consider documenting the rights application process for future reference to assist other users facing similar challenges.
