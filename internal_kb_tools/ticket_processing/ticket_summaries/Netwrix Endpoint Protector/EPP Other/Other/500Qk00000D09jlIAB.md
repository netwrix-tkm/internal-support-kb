## Problem Description
The management console for Blue Halo became inaccessible after they imported a TLS certificate body and key into the "Appliance > Server Maintenance > Server Certificate" section.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after the manual generation of a TLS certificate key.
- The RSA key was incorrectly set to a length of 1024 bits.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the issue was conducted via email communication with the customer.
2. A remote session was proposed to investigate the problem further.
3. During the investigation, errors from NGINX were noted, indicating that the key used was too short.
4. An OpenSSL command was executed to validate the certificate and key, which returned no errors.
5. The customer was informed about the key length issue and the unusual procedure they followed for generating the certificate.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the RSA key being set to only 1024 bits during the manual generation of the key, which is considered too short for secure TLS certificates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correcting the RSA key length. The customer was advised to generate a new key with a longer length, which is standard practice for TLS certificates. This adjustment restored access to the management console.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that RSA keys are generated with a minimum length of 2048 bits to comply with current security standards.
- Future certificate generation should utilize the UI of the appliances/VMs to avoid similar issues, as manual procedures may lead to configuration errors.
