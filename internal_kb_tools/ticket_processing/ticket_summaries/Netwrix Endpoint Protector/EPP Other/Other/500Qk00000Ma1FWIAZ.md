- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AIQON Servicos em Informatica LTDA - MSP

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system in a hybrid work environment. Employees working from home were unable to communicate with the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server, making it impossible to adjust DLP policies.

## Environment Details
- Hybrid work environment with employees both in-office and remote.
- EPP client installed on employee devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that employees working in the office had no issues connecting to the EPP server.
2. Identified that remote employees were experiencing communication issues with the EPP server.
3. Suggested checking the IP configuration of the EPP server to determine if it was set to an internal IP address.
4. Recommended using a VPN for remote employees to access the EPP server if it was indeed an internal IP.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the EPP server being configured with an internal IP address. This configuration allowed access from within the company network but blocked access for remote employees.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming the IP address configuration of the EPP server. It was determined that remote employees could access the server if they connected through a VPN. The customer was advised to ensure that remote employees were using a VPN to establish a secure connection to the internal network.

## Notes
- For future reference, ensure that the EPP server is configured with a public IP address or that remote employees are provided with VPN access to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly review network configurations to accommodate hybrid work environments effectively.
