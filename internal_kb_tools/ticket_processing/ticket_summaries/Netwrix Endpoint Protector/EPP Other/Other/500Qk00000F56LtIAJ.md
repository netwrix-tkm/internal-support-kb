## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the installation of the macOS Data Loss Prevention (DLP) agent. Although the agent was installed on the user's system, the user did not appear in the UI console.

## Environment Details
- Platform: macOS
- Product: Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of the DLP agent on the user's macOS system.
2. Checked network connectivity to ensure the agent could communicate with the UI console.
3. Reviewed the agent logs for any error messages or indications of failure.
4. Confirmed that the user account was correctly configured in the system.
5. Restarted the agent service to see if it would refresh the connection to the UI console.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the user account settings that prevented the agent from properly registering with the UI console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correcting the user account configuration in the system. After making the necessary adjustments, the DLP agent successfully registered the user in the UI console, allowing for proper management and monitoring.

## Notes
- Ensure that user account settings are correctly configured during the installation of the DLP agent to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check agent logs for any signs of communication issues between the agent and the UI console.
