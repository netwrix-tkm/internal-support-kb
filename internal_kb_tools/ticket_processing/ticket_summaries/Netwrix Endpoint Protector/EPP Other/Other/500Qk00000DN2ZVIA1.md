## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with log visibility while conducting a Proof of Concept (POC).

2. Checked the EPP settings to ensure logging was enabled.
3. Reviewed notification settings to confirm alerts were configured correctly.
4. Attempted to access logs through the Netwrix Endpoint Protector interface.
5. Consulted documentation for any known issues related to log visibility.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, it was implied that the configuration settings related to logging may not have been properly set or that there was a temporary glitch in the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the customer themselves, although specific details on the resolution steps taken were not documented. It is recommended that customers ensure all logging settings are correctly configured and to restart the service if log visibility issues persist.

## Notes
- Ensure that logging is enabled in the EPP settings before applying policies.
- If log visibility issues arise, consider restarting the Netwrix Endpoint Protector service as a first troubleshooting step.
- Document any self-resolutions in future cases to aid in knowledge sharing.
