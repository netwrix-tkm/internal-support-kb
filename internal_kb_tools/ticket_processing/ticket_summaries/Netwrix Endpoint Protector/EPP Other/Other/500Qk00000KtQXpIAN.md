The customer received an email notification regarding a security vulnerability (ADV-2025-001) affecting their organization, but no additional instructions were provided for remediation or mitigation.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector (formerly CosoSys Endpoint Protector).
- The current version in use is 5941.
