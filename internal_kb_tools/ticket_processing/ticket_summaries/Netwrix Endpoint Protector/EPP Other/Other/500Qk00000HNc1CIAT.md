## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the licensing mechanism for Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically regarding the automatic removal of stale or offline devices and the conditions under which licenses are assigned.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 5940
- **Age:** 1.7

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the options available in the system Web UI.
2. Consulted the Netwrix documentation for information on licensing and device management.
3. Addressed specific questions regarding the time period for device removal and license assignment.

## Root Cause
The customer was unclear about the licensing policies and the automatic management of devices that do not contact the server for a specified duration.

## Solution
The customer was informed that:
- The system does automatically remove devices that have not contacted the server within a set period, although the specific duration was not detailed in the response.
- Licenses are only assigned to computers that are marked as 'Online' within the tool.
- The customer confirmed satisfaction with the provided information and agreed to close the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify the specific time limit for device removal in future inquiries, as this detail was not explicitly provided in the response.
- Ensure that customers are aware that licensing is contingent upon device status (Online/Offline) to prevent confusion.
