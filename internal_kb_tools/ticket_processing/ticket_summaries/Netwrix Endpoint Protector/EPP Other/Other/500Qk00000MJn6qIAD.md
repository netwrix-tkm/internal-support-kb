- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ZeMoSo Labs
- **Contact Name:** Raghavendhar P J K
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was showing a critical low disk space warning, indicating only 2.79 GB of free space available from a total of 40.69 GB (7%). This situation was affecting the functionality and performance of the EPP Server.

## Environment Details
- The appliance was running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer had a syslog file of approximately 12 GB that was being sent to their SIEM, which they did not want to delete.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Assisted the client through a remote session.
2. Connected to the backend of the appliance.
3. Removed a mailer file that was consuming several GB of space.
4. Deleted older backup files to free up additional space.
5. Informed the client about the implications of the large syslog file and the need to address connectivity issues with their SIEM.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the accumulation of large log files and backups, which led to the disk space being critically low. The syslog file, in particular, was growing continuously due to its configuration with the SIEM.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing space from the backend by removing unnecessary files, including the mailer file and older backups.
- This action reduced the disk usage from over 90% to approximately 72%, alleviating the immediate low disk space warning.

## Notes
- The client was advised that the syslog file would continue to grow unless they resolved the connectivity issue with their SIEM.
- The client agreed to keep the ticket open for a few days to monitor the situation and follow up on any further developments.
