## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Microsoft Teams application was not functioning on certain systems when the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software was installed. The application worked correctly when the DLP was uninstalled, indicating a conflict between the DLP and Teams.

## Environment Details
- The DLP policies were only in Monitoring mode and no policies were enabled to block Microsoft Teams or any other applications.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the DLP was installed on the affected systems.
2. Uninstalled the DLP software, which allowed Microsoft Teams to function properly.
3. Reinstalled the DLP software to confirm the issue persisted with Teams.
4. Checked DLP policy settings to ensure no policies were actively blocking Teams.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between the DLP software and the Microsoft Teams application. Although no blocking policies were enabled, the DLP's presence affected Teams' functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the DLP was not configured to block Teams, and it was determined that the DLP software itself was causing the conflict. The case was linked to another existing case (00412555) for further troubleshooting, and the customer was advised to follow up on that case for a comprehensive resolution.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that DLP policies are thoroughly reviewed and tested in a controlled environment before deployment to avoid conflicts with essential applications like Microsoft Teams.
- Future cases involving application conflicts with DLP should consider checking for any hidden or implicit blocking settings that may not be immediately visible in the policy configurations.
