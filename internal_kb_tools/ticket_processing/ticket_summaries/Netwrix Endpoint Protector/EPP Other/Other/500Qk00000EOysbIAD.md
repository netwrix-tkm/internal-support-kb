- **Case Number:** 418026
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Seamless Infotech Pvt. Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Amarpreet Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Other
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the file blocking policy configured to prevent the uploading or sending of encrypted file types was not functioning as expected. Specifically, encrypted PDF files were not being blocked, which was contrary to the intended behavior of the policy.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the file blocking policy to ensure it included encrypted PDF files.
2. Conducted tests to replicate the issue by attempting to upload and send encrypted PDF files from the computer machine.
3. Reviewed logs and alerts generated by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to identify any discrepancies or errors related to the policy enforcement.
4. Consulted documentation to confirm the expected behavior of the file blocking policy concerning encrypted files.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the file blocking policy settings, which did not correctly account for the specific characteristics of encrypted PDF files.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the file blocking policy settings to explicitly include the criteria for encrypted PDF files. After making the necessary changes, the policy was tested again, and it successfully blocked the uploading and sending of encrypted PDF files as intended.

## Notes
- Ensure that all file types, especially those that may have encryption, are explicitly defined in the file blocking policy to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and test policy configurations after updates or changes to the system to ensure continued compliance with security requirements.
