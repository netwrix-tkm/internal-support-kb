## Problem Description
The customer reported inconsistencies in the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) reporting for users where the agent was installed. Additionally, some equipment did not report any data, and there was a lack of connection with the SIEM tool, which was also not reporting any information.

## Environment Details
- The DLP agent was installed on multiple user machines.
- The SIEM tool in use was Wazuh.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to gather more details about the missing logs and SIEM integration issues.
2. Requested the customer to reattach any missing evidence or logs that were not included in the initial communication.
3. Suggested setting up a remote session to investigate the configuration issues further.
4. Enabled syslog-ng from the backend to facilitate SIEM integration.
5. Informed the customer to reach out to Wazuh support for any necessary changes on their end.
6. Started the server upgrade process since the customer was on an outdated version (5.8.1.0).
7. Followed up with the customer regarding the application of the latest updates and the specifics of the inconsistencies.

## Root Cause
The inconsistencies in DLP reporting were primarily due to configuration issues and the need for an upgrade to the latest version of the software. Additionally, the SIEM integration was not properly configured, which contributed to the lack of reporting.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Upgrading the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to version 5.9.3.0.
- Ensuring that syslog-ng was properly configured to facilitate communication with the SIEM tool.
- The customer was advised to check their configurations and ensure that all necessary options were activated for reporting.

## Notes
- Ensure that the customer has a valid license before troubleshooting similar issues, as this can affect the ability to resolve problems.
- Always verify that the latest updates are applied to the software to avoid issues related to outdated versions.
- For future cases, consider scheduling remote sessions early in the troubleshooting process to expedite resolution.
