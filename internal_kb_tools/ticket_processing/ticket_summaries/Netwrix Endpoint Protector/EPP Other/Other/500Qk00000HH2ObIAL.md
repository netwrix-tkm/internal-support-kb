## Problem Description
A user in the test group encountered a block while attempting to attach a screenshot to an email after the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) analysis process. No remediation popup appeared during the initial attempts, but after several trials, the user was able to attach the screenshot.

## Environment Details
- Content-aware policies were configured with the following thresholds and actions:
  1. Threshold: 100 - Action: Block & Remediate
  2. Threshold: 50 - Action: Report Only
  3. Threshold: 10 - Action: Report Only

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the content-aware policy settings and thresholds.
2. Confirmed that the EPP client was functioning correctly.
3. Discussed the OCR process and its timing with the user.
4. Conducted a remote session to observe the issue in real-time.
5. Instructed the user on how to generate log files for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the EPP client needing to perform OCR on the spot for new images. The OCR process can take several seconds to minutes, during which file transfers are blocked. If the OCR does not complete within the maximum waiting time (set to 9 seconds), the file is automatically blocked.

## Solution
The user was informed that the delay in attaching the screenshot was due to the OCR process. After the OCR was completed successfully, the user was able to attach the file without issues. It was recommended that users wait a little longer when dealing with new files to allow the OCR process to complete.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that this behavior primarily occurs with new files that have not been previously analyzed.
- It is advisable to monitor the OCR process and inform users about potential delays when attaching new images.
- Ensure that users are familiar with the content-aware policies in place to avoid confusion during file transfers.
