## Problem Description
The customer, Sean Reilly, requested a feature to automatically remove USB devices from Netwrix Endpoint Protector that have not been connected for a specified period. This request was prompted by performance issues caused by an excessive number of USB devices (over 10,000), many of which had not been used in years.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the performance of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector due to a large number of inactive USB devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current configuration and usage of USB devices within the Endpoint Protector.
2. Identified that over 10,000 USB devices were registered, with many being inactive for extended periods (up to 3 years).
3. Collaborated with support teams to analyze performance issues linked to the high number of registered devices.
4. Manually removed USB devices that had not been used in the last 3 months, which resolved the performance issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the performance issues was identified as the excessive number of registered USB devices in the Endpoint Protector system, many of which had not been connected for a significant amount of time.

## Solution
The solution involved implementing a feature request for an automated process to remove USB devices that have not been connected for a specified duration. This automation would help maintain optimal performance by preventing the accumulation of inactive devices.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the number of registered USB devices regularly to avoid similar performance issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a scheduled review or automated cleanup process for inactive devices to enhance system performance and management efficiency.
