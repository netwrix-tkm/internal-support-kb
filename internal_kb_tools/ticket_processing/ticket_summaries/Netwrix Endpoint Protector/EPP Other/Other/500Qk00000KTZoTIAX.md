## Problem Description
The customer, OneMain Holdings Inc., inquired about the implementation of the CyberArk software tool (EPM Product) for privilege access management on physical laptops. They sought clarification on whether the CyberArk Agent would require any exclusions from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) agent to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth operation.

## Environment Details
- **Software in Use:** CyberArk (EPM Product)
- **Security Software:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP)
- **Deployment Scope:** All physical laptops within the organization

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer raised a question regarding potential conflicts between the CyberArk Agent and the EPP agent.
2. The support team escalated the inquiry to engineering for further insights.
3. The customer decided to proceed with the CyberArk deployment without waiting for a response from R&D.

## Root Cause
No specific root cause was identified as the inquiry was primarily about potential conflicts between two software agents. The lack of response from R&D did not lead to any issues during the deployment.

## Solution
The customer proceeded with the deployment of CyberArk without any exclusions or modifications to the EPP agent. Fortunately, there were no conflicts or issues reported during or after the implementation.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the interaction between CyberArk and EPP agents in future deployments to ensure compatibility.
- Customers should be encouraged to wait for technical confirmations before proceeding with deployments that may involve multiple security solutions, although in this case, the deployment was successful without issues.
