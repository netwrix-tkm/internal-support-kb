## Problem Description
The customer, Anatoli Lorenz, reported an issue where all clients were accidentally deleted from the PROD console due to selecting the wrong checkmark during a cleanup process. The deletion occurred on 2025-02-11 at 08:44:39, and the customer requested assistance to restore the deleted clients and their settings from a backup.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Incident Date:** 2025-02-11

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for restoring deleted clients and settings.
2. Investigated the possibility of importing a backup of the clients/settings.
3. Communicated with the customer regarding the status of the restoration process.
4. Noted that the customer later decided to set the settings manually instead of restoring from a backup.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by user error during the cleanup process, where the wrong checkmark was selected, leading to the unintended deletion of all clients from the PROD console.

## Solution
The customer ultimately decided that restoring from a backup was no longer necessary. Instead, they opted to manually set the client settings. The ticket was closed during a bi-monthly meeting with the customer, confirming that no further action was required.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that users are trained on the implications of selecting options in the console to prevent accidental deletions.
- Future cases involving accidental deletions should consider the possibility of manual restoration as an alternative to backup restoration, depending on the customer's preference and urgency.
