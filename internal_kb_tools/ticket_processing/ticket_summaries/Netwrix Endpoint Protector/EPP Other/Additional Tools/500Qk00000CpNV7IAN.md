## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Live Update feature in Netwrix Endpoint Protector, where a specific security update ("Security Update â€“ EPP Server Hotfix #1.1") repeatedly appeared in the update list despite being applied multiple times.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Endpoint Protector version 5.3.7.0.
- The issue arose after attempting to apply the update multiple times, which resulted in the update still being displayed as pending.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer applied the update multiple times.
2. Customer checked the list of updates and confirmed that the update appeared multiple times as installed.
3. Technical support advised the customer to disregard the persistent update notification.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a known bug in the update management system of Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which caused certain updates to remain visible even after successful installation. This behavior is expected to resolve itself with future server version releases.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to disregard the persistent update notification. It was confirmed that the update had been successfully applied, and the lingering notification would eventually disappear with the release of a new server version.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues with persistent update notifications should be informed that this is a known behavior and can be disregarded if the update has been applied successfully.
- It is recommended to monitor for future server updates that may address this bug.
