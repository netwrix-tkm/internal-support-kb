## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to update their clients to version 3.0.2.1 on MacBooks. The update option was deactivated during the deployment process, although manual installation on individual machines worked without issues.

## Environment Details
- Platform: MacBooks
- Timezone of the customer: -6 GMT (Honduras)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer attempted to deploy the update through the standard deployment process, but the option was deactivated.
2. Manual installation of the update was performed on a single machine, which succeeded without issues.
3. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it was implied that there may have been a configuration or permission issue preventing the deployment option from being activated.

## Solution

## Notes
- Ensure that all deployment settings are correctly configured before attempting updates.
- If deployment options are deactivated, consider checking permissions and configurations related to the deployment tool.
- Manual installation can serve as a temporary workaround while troubleshooting deployment issues.
