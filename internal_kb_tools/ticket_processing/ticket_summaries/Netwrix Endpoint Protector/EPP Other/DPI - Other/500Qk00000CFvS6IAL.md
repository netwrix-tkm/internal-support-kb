- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** DPI - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to retrieve 24-hour logs in the Content Aware Report. Instead, they were only able to access logs for 2-3 hours, which contained a maximum of 10,000 entries. The customer requested assistance to obtain at least 24-48 hours of logs for analysis.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** EPP Other

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer initially advised the customer to use the "Export" button at the bottom of the log list to generate a report with more than 10,000 entries.
2. The customer attempted the suggested method but reported that it did not work.
3. A remote connection was proposed to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was determined that the limitation on log retrieval was due to the default settings of the reporting feature, which capped the number of entries displayed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer on how to properly generate a report for the desired time frame. The support engineer instructed the customer to utilize the "Export" feature effectively, which allowed them to access the logs for the required duration.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be aware of the limitations on log entries when generating reports. Users should utilize the "Export" feature to retrieve larger datasets.
- Future support interactions should ensure that users are fully informed about the capabilities and limitations of the reporting features in Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
