- **Account/Company:** StarTech Networks Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Manish Panchal
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Client Requests
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that websites not included in the denylist were being blocked by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Account:** StarTech Networks Inc.
- **Contact:** Manish Panchal, Head IT

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Engaged with the customer to schedule a remote session for further investigation.
2. Conducted tests to determine if the issue persisted with Endpoint Protector (EPP) uninstalled.
3. Enabled stealth DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) to analyze traffic and identify the cause of the blockage.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the firewall or another application interfering with the traffic to blob and S3 Amazon websites, leading to unintended blocking of sites not listed in the denylist.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by enabling stealth DPI, which allowed for better traffic analysis and management. This adjustment helped to prevent the firewall or other applications from incorrectly blocking legitimate sites.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor firewall settings and other security applications that may conflict with Netwrix Endpoint Protector to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular updates and configuration checks of the denylist and firewall rules are recommended to ensure proper functionality.
