- **Contact Name:** Vikas Kataria

- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Client Requests
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the internet connection on their systems would stop working intermittently after the system remained idle for more than 10 minutes. Users were still able to ping external sites like Google via the command line, indicating that the network interface was still operational.

## Environment Details
- **Client Machines:** Both Mac and Windows
- **Server IP:** 3.6.9.100
- **Hosting Platform:** Hosted by EPP

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to restart the browser and sign out of the system, but the internet only resumed after a full system restart.
2. The support team requested additional information regarding the impact of the issue, affected users, and steps to reproduce.
3. A remote session was proposed to gather logs from the affected systems.
4. The support team provided instructions for collecting logs using the EPPSupportTool.
5. The customer was advised to check if the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) option was enabled in the settings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was suggested that the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature might be interfering with the internet connectivity after the system resumes from sleep mode.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) feature in the Endpoint Protector settings. After this change, the internet connectivity issue was no longer reproducible, and the customer confirmed that the problem had been resolved.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the impact of disabling DPI, as it may affect the functionality of other security features.
- Future cases should consider checking DPI settings if similar connectivity issues arise after systems resume from sleep mode.
- The customer was advised to test the solution further and report back if the issue recurs.
