## Problem Description
The customer, Gabriel Jung, reported issues with creating a regex pattern for compliance with LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) standards. The existing regex was generating false positives, and the customer requested assistance in refining it to achieve more accurate results.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- Contextual detection for Brazilian ID was previously set up.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to understand the specific false positives encountered.
2. Identified that the regex was incorrectly matching an IP address as a Brazilian ID.
3. Suggested setting up contextual detection to help reduce false positives.
4. Scheduled a remote session to create a new regex and contextual detection rule.
5. Conducted the remote session to implement the contextual detection.

## Root Cause
The false positives were primarily caused by the regex pattern not being sufficiently refined, leading to incorrect matches, including misidentifying IP addresses as Brazilian IDs.

## Solution
- Implemented contextual detection for Brazilian IDs during a remote session with the customer. This approach aimed to limit false positives while maintaining compliance with LGPD requirements.
- The customer was advised to test the new setup to confirm its effectiveness in reducing false positives.

## Notes
- It is important to note that while contextual detection can help reduce false positives, it may not eliminate them entirely.
- Future support for regex configuration may be limited, so customers should be encouraged to refine their regex patterns as needed.
