## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NJ6R6IAL
- **Case Number:** 439908
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Privat Bank
- **Contact Name:** CoreWin Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Client Requests
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The PrivatBank customer is migrating to a new EPP instance but is facing issues with the migration of shadow copies and logs using the SystemBackup v2 option. The customer is concerned about losing these important data during the migration process.

## Environment Details
- The customer is migrating to a new AWS instance.
- The customer can allocate an S3 Bucket for temporary storage of logs and copies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry (25.03):** Customer requested assistance with migrating logs and shadow copies.
2. **Internal Check (27.03):** Confirmed that moving audit logs from one server to another is not possible.
3. **Remote Session Scheduled (28.03):** Discussed options with the customer, confirming that shadows can only be downloaded via Audit Log Backup.
4. **Follow-up (01.04):** Customer requested to keep the case open until migration is completed.
5. **Final Follow-up (17.04):** Inquired about the migration date.

## Root Cause
The inability to migrate audit logs and shadow copies is due to the design of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which does not support the transfer of these data types between servers. The audit logs are cleared monthly, which further complicates the migration process.

## Solution
The recommended solution is for the customer to:
- Create an Audit Log Backup after the migration to ensure all logs and shadows are captured.
- Store the backup in a secure location, such as the allocated S3 Bucket.
- Download the audit logs to retain necessary historical data.

## Notes
- The customer cannot leave the old server powered on, as they plan to delete it after migration.
- It is crucial for the customer to perform the backup immediately after migration to avoid losing any logs or shadows.
- Future customers should be informed that logs can only be moved if they are still available and not cleared by the monthly audit process.
