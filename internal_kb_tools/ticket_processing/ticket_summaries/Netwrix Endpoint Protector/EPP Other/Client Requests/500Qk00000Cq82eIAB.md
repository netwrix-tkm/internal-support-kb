- **Case Number:** 414516
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Shield Force
- **Contact Name:** David Godinez Martinez
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Client Requests
- **Version:** Premium Version 5.7.1.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue accessing the Endpoint Protection CoSoSys console, receiving a "500 Internal Server Error" message. This issue was previously encountered and attributed to disk saturation.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** Premium Version 5.7.1.0
- **Operating System:** No affected endpoints reported.
- **Client Versions Affected:** None (5.8.4.1 - Windows)
- **Server ID:** W8R14WAZ
- **Time Zone:** Mexico City (GMT-6)
- **Hosting:** On-premise, managed by CoSoSys.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was contacted to schedule a remote session to investigate the issue.
2. During the remote session, the support engineer attempted to access the EPP server backend.
3. The support engineer identified that the issue was likely related to disk space.
4. Space was cleared on the system disk from the backend.
5. The support engineer tested access to the console after clearing space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as disk saturation, which prevented the console from being accessed. The system disk was overloaded, leading to the "500 Internal Server Error."

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing space on the system disk. After the cleanup, the disk usage was reduced to approximately 38%, allowing successful access to the EPP console. The support engineer confirmed that they could reach the login page after the changes were made.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If the EPP server is hosted in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), ensure that specific ports are open for SSH access to the backend.
- Always confirm the hosting environment and server details before troubleshooting to expedite the resolution process.
