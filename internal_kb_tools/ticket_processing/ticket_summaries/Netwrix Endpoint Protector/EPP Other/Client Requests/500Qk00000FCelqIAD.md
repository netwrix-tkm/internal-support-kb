## Problem Description
The customer, Aakash Gupta from Infrasoft Technologies Limited, requested offline agents for RHEL 8.10 servers after migrating from CentOS 7.9. The servers do not have internet access, necessitating the provision of offline installation files.

## Environment Details
- **Previous OS:** CentOS 7.9
- **Current OS:** RHEL 8.10
- **Internet Access:** None on client servers

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Located the official download link for the offline agent specific to RHEL 8.10.
4. Shared the download link with the customer for the offline agent installation.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's migration to a new operating system (RHEL 8.10) which required specific offline agents for installation due to the lack of internet access on the servers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the official download link for the offline agent compatible with RHEL 8.10:
```
https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_rhel_8.10_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz
```
The customer was able to download and install the agent successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that future requests for offline agents specify the operating system and version to avoid delays.
- Verify compatibility of the agent with the specific version of the operating system before sharing download links.
