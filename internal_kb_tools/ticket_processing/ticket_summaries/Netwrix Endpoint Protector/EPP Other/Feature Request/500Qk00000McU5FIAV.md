## Problem Description
The customer, Paul Eisermann from MBDA Deutschland GmbH, reported an inability to respond to a feature request due to the original ticket being closed for more than 30 days.

## Environment Details
- **Customer's Role:** IT System Manager Clients
- **Location:** Hagenauer Forst 27, 86529 Schrobenhausen, GERMANY
- **Contact Information:** 
  - Phone: +49 8252 99 8858

  - Email: paul.eisermann@mbda-systems.de

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to check if the feature request was covered under the existing system configuration settings.
2. The specific setting to verify was: 
   - **System Configuration -> System Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection - Auto-refresh Certificate -> enable, then configure frequency.**

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for a feature that was not currently available in the product, specifically the ability to automatically renew internal SSL certificates using their own PKI.

## Solution
The support team provided guidance on checking existing settings that might fulfill the customer's request. They confirmed that the feature request was noted and would be forwarded to the Product team for further consideration. The ticket was then soft closed after documenting the information.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that feature requests may take time to be reviewed and implemented.
- It is recommended to check existing system settings before submitting a new feature request to ensure that the desired functionality is not already available.
- Future communications regarding feature requests should be directed to the appropriate channels to avoid delays due to ticket closure policies.
