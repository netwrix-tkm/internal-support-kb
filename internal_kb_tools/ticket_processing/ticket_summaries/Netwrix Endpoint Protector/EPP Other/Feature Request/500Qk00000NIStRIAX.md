## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether CoSoSys allows integration with Zscaler CASB using ICAP and requested information on the availability of this feature.

## Environment Details
- The customer is in the process of implementing Zscaler CASB.
- The integration of EPP with Zscaler is part of their roadmap for 2025.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Internally confirmed that ICAP integration is not currently supported.
2. Suggested testing the latest EPP Client (v5941) with Zscaler to check compatibility.
3. Proposed scheduling a remote session to investigate further if issues arise during testing.
4. Collected feedback from the customer regarding the necessity of ICAP integration for their DLP policies.

## Root Cause

- The customer was advised to test the latest EPP Client with Zscaler and report back on the results.

## Notes

- The customer should provide details on the necessity of ICAP to facilitate the feature request process.
- It is important to keep track of any updates regarding the roadmap for future reference.
