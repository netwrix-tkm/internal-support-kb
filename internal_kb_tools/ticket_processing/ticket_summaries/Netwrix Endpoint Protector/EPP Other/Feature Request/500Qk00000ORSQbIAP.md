- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in exporting logs along with their associated log basis but did not specify the type of logs needed.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The customer was looking to export logs from the Content Aware Protection (CAP) feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication was sent to the customer requesting clarification on the specific type of logs needed (CAP or DC).
2. The customer provided screenshots and clarified that they wanted to export log details along with the logs.
3. Suggested filtering the logs by the desired matched items and downloading the list in formats such as Excel, PDF, or CSV.
4. Advised the customer to check the maximum records display settings in the Device Control -> Global Settings.
5. Investigated the possibility of exporting sub-logs under each CAP log.

## Root Cause
The initial confusion stemmed from the customer's vague request regarding the type of logs they needed to export. Additionally, limitations in the filtering and exporting capabilities of the software were identified when dealing with large volumes of logs (10K+).

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer on how to:
- Filter the logs using specific criteria to narrow down the results.
- Use the "Create Export" function to select the desired format (CSV or Excel) for the export.
- Access the filtered logs and download them through the "View Export List" option.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to specify the type of logs they wish to export to avoid confusion.
- Users should be aware of the limitations regarding the number of logs that can be filtered and exported at once, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- Future inquiries should include a request for screenshots or examples to better understand the customer's needs.
