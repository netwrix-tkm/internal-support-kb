## Problem Description
The customer reported that when changing a password, the system indicates that they have entered "12 letters," which is misleading. The customer suggested that the message should refer to "characters" or "symbols" instead, as it could include numbers and special characters, potentially causing confusion.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's description and the attached screenshot.
2. Confirmed the behavior of the password change notification.
3. Discussed the issue internally to determine if it was a known problem or a feature limitation.
4. Raised a feature request through the portal for adjusting the terminology used in the password change notification.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a terminology inconsistency in the password change notification message. The system incorrectly referred to the input as "letters" instead of a more inclusive term like "characters" or "symbols."

## Solution
A feature request was raised through the support portal to update the terminology in the password change notification. This change aims to clarify the message for users, ensuring it accurately reflects the types of characters that can be used in passwords.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor user feedback regarding terminology used in the application, as it can significantly impact user experience and understanding.
- Future cases involving terminology issues should be documented and considered for feature requests to improve clarity and usability.
