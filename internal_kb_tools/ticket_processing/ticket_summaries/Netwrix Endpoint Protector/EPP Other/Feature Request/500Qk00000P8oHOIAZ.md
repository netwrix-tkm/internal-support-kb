## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P8oHOIAZ
- **Case Number:** 445036
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** VicCnS Co.,Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Donghyun Kim
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** EPP Other
- **Feature:** Transfer Limit
- **Version:** Server Version 5.9.4.1, Client Version 3.0.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the behavior of the Transfer Limit feature in Endpoint Protector, specifically regarding its interaction with the CAP policy settings and the functionality of the "Transfer Limit Reached Report."

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** macOS 15 (Sequoia)
- **Server Version:** 5.9.4.1
- **Client Version:** 3.0.4.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the Transfer Limit feature's functionality in relation to CAP policy settings.
2. Confirmed the behavior of the Transfer Limit feature when the CAP policy is set to "Report Only" versus "Block and Report."
3. Explained the purpose of the "Transfer Limit Reached Report" and its reporting intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
4. Instructed the customer on where to find the reports in the Endpoint Protector dashboard.

## Root Cause
The behavior observed by the customer, where the enforcement of the Transfer Limit feature depends on the CAP policy setting, is intended and by design. The "Report Only" policy allows monitoring without blocking uploads, while "Block and Report" enforces the limit.

## Solution
The customer's questions were addressed as follows:
- Confirmed that the Transfer Limit feature's enforcement is dependent on the CAP policy setting.
- Explained that the "Transfer Limit Reached Report" generates summaries of users or endpoints that have reached their transfer limits and can be accessed in the Endpoint Protector dashboard under “Reports and Analysis” > “Logs report.”
- The customer confirmed that their questions were fully answered, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- Administrators should be aware that the choice of CAP policy directly affects the enforcement of the Transfer Limit feature.
- For future inquiries regarding report generation, customers should specify their requirements for customization or export options.
