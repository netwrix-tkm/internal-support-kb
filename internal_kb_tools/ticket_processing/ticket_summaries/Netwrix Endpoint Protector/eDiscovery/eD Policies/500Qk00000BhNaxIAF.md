## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BhNaxIAF
- **Case Number:** 411604
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ACI Worldwide US
- **Contact Name:** Adam Davis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** eDiscovery
- **Feature:** eD Policies
- **Version:** 2.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in creating a custom policy using the create custom policy wizard in Netwrix Endpoint Protector. They needed to detect credit card information and bank routing numbers with an alert-only policy. Additionally, they sought guidance on setting up eDiscovery to view data at rest and in transit, focusing on specific folders and paths for scanning.

## Environment Details
The customer had previously defined these policies in a proof of concept (POC) environment, but they lost access to that information due to an expired license.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to discuss the requirements in detail.
2. Reviewed the customer's previous POC setup to understand their needs.
3. Provided guidance on how to create custom policies for detecting sensitive information.
4. Explained how to configure eDiscovery settings for data at rest and in transit.
5. Assisted in setting up folder-specific scanning configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of access to their previous POC configurations due to an expired license, which hindered their ability to replicate the desired policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Conducting a remote session where the support technician guided the customer through the process of creating the necessary custom policies.
- Demonstrating how to set up alerts for credit card and bank routing number detection.
- Providing instructions on configuring eDiscovery for both data at rest and in transit, as well as how to limit scans to specific folders.

## Notes
- Ensure that licenses are renewed timely to avoid loss of access to configurations.
- Document all custom policies and configurations for future reference, especially when team members leave.
- Encourage customers to maintain a record of their POC setups to facilitate easier transitions in case of license expirations.
