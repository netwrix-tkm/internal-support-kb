## Problem Description
The customer reported that after applying the scanning, reports were not generated across multiple devices.

## Environment Details
- The partitions from eDiscovery are time-labeled, meaning specific partitions must be selected based on the desired time frame for the search.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the reports were not generated after scanning multiple devices.
2. Collected logs during a remote session to analyze the issue.
3. Reviewed the partitioning system to ensure the correct time-labeled partitions were being selected for searches.
4. Notified the customer about the importance of selecting the correct partition for the desired time frame.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the misunderstanding of how the time-labeled partitions functioned in eDiscovery. When a new scan is initiated, all previous scan results are lost, and the correct partition must be selected to retrieve specific historical data.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer about the partitioning system:
- The customer was advised to select the appropriate time-labeled partition (e.g., June last year) to access the desired scan results.
- It was emphasized that an Audit Log backup for eDiscovery is recommended before starting a new scan, as a popup message alerts users of this when initiating a new scan.

## Notes
- Always ensure that the correct time-labeled partition is selected for searches to avoid missing scan results.
- Remind customers to back up Audit Logs before starting new scans to prevent data loss from previous scans.
