## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CPiDRIA1
- **Case Number:** 413364
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TM System Pvt Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Satish Kalola
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** eDiscovery
- **Feature:** eD Policies
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the eDiscovery policy created to detect PAN card data in a text file was not functioning as expected.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The specific feature in question was the eDiscovery policies.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Andrei Pop, suggested creating a similar policy for the CAP (Content Aware Protection) to check if it could detect the file.
2. The customer was asked to verify if a location list for eDiscovery was configured.
3. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was implied that the configuration of the eDiscovery policy or the absence of a location list may have contributed to the detection failure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after confirming the correct setup of the eDiscovery policy and ensuring that the necessary location list was in place. The customer was able to run the eDiscovery successfully after these adjustments.

## Notes
- Ensure that location lists are properly configured for eDiscovery policies to function effectively.
- It may be beneficial to test similar policies (e.g., CAP) to determine if the issue is isolated to a specific policy type.
- Future cases should consider verifying policy configurations and associated lists as a first step in troubleshooting.
