## Problem Description
The customer requested the eDiscovery scan results for the last six months and needed assistance in downloading the eDiscovery scan data.

## Environment Details
- The server contained only 2 months of logs, which was insufficient for the customer's request for the last six months of data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current logs available on the server, confirming that only 2 months of logs were present.
2. Suggested checking the Audit Log Backup for older logs that may contain the requested data.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the server was configured to retain only 2 months of logs, which did not meet the customer's request for a six-month eDiscovery scan result.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to check the Audit Log Backup for older logs that could contain the necessary eDiscovery scan data for the requested six-month period.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that log retention settings are configured appropriately to meet customer needs, especially for eDiscovery purposes.
- Future requests for historical data should consider the retention policy in place to avoid similar issues.
