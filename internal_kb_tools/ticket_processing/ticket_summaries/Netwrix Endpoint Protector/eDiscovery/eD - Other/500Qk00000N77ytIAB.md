## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N77ytIAB
- **Case Number:** 439388
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** UCI Health
- **Contact Name:** Brandon Thompson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** eDiscovery
- **Feature:** eD - Other
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they could only see a maximum of 200 devices in the admin console, regardless of selecting options for 500 or ALL. Additionally, they needed a way to easily add incorrectly detected devices to a whitelist or custom allowance.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Build Number:** 5940

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Instructed the customer to log into the EPP console and navigate to Device Control > Global Settings.
2. Advised the customer to scroll to the bottom of the screen to find Display Settings and adjust the "Maximum no. of records returned in a report search."
3. Suggested saving the changes and returning to Device Control > Computers to select the desired number of entries to display.
4. Requested screenshots of the display issue for further investigation.
5. Provided instructions on how to configure devices using VID and PID instead of serial numbers.

## Root Cause
The limitation of displaying only 200 devices was due to the default settings in the admin console, which restricts the number of records returned in a report search.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to adjust the display settings in the EPP console to increase the maximum number of records returned in a report search. Additionally, the customer was provided with detailed instructions on how to configure devices using VID and PID, allowing them to whitelist devices without needing to specify serial numbers.

## Notes
- It is important to remind customers to adjust their display settings if they encounter similar limitations in the future.
- When configuring devices, using a serial number range of `0000000000000000` to `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` for VID and PID allows for the inclusion of all possible serial numbers, which can simplify the whitelisting process for multiple identical devices.
