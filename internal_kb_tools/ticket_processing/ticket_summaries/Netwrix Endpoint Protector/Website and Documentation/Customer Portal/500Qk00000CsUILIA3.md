- **Case Number:** 414592
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bowman Gilfillan
- **Contact Name:** Shaun Morris
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Website and Documentation

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their hosted Endpoint Protector appliance was down, displaying an error message indicating that there was no space left on the device. This issue was critical as it affected their operations.

## Environment Details
- The appliance is hosted by CoSoSys on AWS.
- The error message received was: 
  ```
  Warning: mkdir() [function.mkdir]: No space left on device in /var/www/EPPServer/lib/cache/sfFileCache.class.php on line 482
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to log a ticket but faced issues with the ticketing system.
2. The support team requested SSH access to investigate the backend of the EPP appliance.
3. Upon gaining access, the support team checked the disk space and identified that the root partition was full.
4. The support team cleaned the journal in the root partition to free up space.
5. After cleaning, the system was monitored for performance and stability.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was a lack of disk space on the root partition of the hosted EPP appliance, which was preventing the creation of new directories and files.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by cleaning the journal in the root partition, which freed up sufficient space for the appliance to function correctly. Following this, the system was confirmed to be operational, and the customer was able to apply the necessary hotfix.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- The customer was running an outdated version (5920) of the software, which had known issues with device duplication that could lead to high load. An upgrade to version 5930 was recommended to address these issues.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need for regular maintenance and updates to their systems to avoid operational disruptions.
