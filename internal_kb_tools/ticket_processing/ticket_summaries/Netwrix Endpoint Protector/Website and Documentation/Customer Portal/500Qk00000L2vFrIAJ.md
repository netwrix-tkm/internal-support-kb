- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AdvisorEngine Inc
- **Contact Name:** Brian Higgins
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Website and Documentation

## Problem Description
The new administrator of AdvisorEngine Inc reported that they were unable to connect to the Netwrix website and lacked visibility into their products and licenses.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the customer portal page where the product was missing.
- The administrator was new, and it was suspected that the previous admin may have had the setup configured.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made with the new admin to gather details about the issue.
2. Investigation revealed that the product was missing from the customer portal page.
3. Communication with Cristian was initiated to check with Michael P. regarding the setup.
4. A postponement was noted for further investigation until the following Wednesday.
5. An account was created in Salesforce for the user to ensure proper access.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of the product visibility in the customer portal, likely due to the previous admin's configuration not being transferred or set up for the new admin.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating an account in Salesforce for the new admin, which provided the correct view of the product on the customer portal. This allowed the new admin to access the necessary information regarding their products and licenses.

## Notes
- It is important for new administrators to verify their access and visibility settings upon taking over an account.
- Future cases involving new admins should include a check of the previous admin's configurations to ensure continuity of access and visibility.
