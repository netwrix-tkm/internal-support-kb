## Problem Description
The customer, Lockheed Martin, inquired about upgrade options for their older version of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) server and client. They specifically wanted to know about support for offline operation, compatibility with CentOS 7, and support for newer distributions like CentOS 8, Rocky Linux 8, and Alma Linux 8.

3. Gathered information regarding EPP's support for offline operation.
4. Investigated compatibility with newer Linux distributions (CentOS 8, Rocky Linux 8, Alma Linux 8).

## Root Cause
The inquiry stemmed from the customer's need to understand the capabilities and future upgrade paths for their existing EPP setup, particularly in an offline environment with an outdated server and client version.

## Solution
The support technician, Zachary Roy, provided answers to the customer's questions regarding:
- EPP's continued support for offline operation.
- Compatibility with CentOS 7 and the potential for support with newer distributions.
- Recommendations for future upgrades based on the current setup.

The customer was satisfied with the information provided, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to keep in mind that older versions of software may have limitations regarding compatibility with newer operating systems and features.
- Future inquiries regarding upgrades should consider the implications of operating in an offline environment, as this may affect available options and support.
