- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Manish Panchal, reported that he was unable to find the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) of an external storage device on his Windows machine after installing a policy in device control. This was preventing him from keeping the official storage device open.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows (specific version not provided)
- **Product in Use:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer, Botond Biro, reached out to Manish to schedule a remote session to assist with the issue.
2. Several email exchanges occurred to confirm availability for the remote session.
3. During the remote session, the support engineer guided Manish on how to locate the VID and PID on his Windows device.

## Root Cause
The issue was not due to a malfunction or misconfiguration of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector but rather a lack of knowledge on how to access the VID and PID information on the Windows operating system.

## Solution
The support engineer successfully resolved the issue by demonstrating to Manish where to find the VID and PID of the external storage device on his Windows machine. This involved navigating through the device manager or using command line tools to retrieve the necessary identifiers.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be familiar with accessing device information on their operating systems, especially when working with device control policies.
- Future support cases involving VID and PID retrieval should include guidance on how to access this information on various operating systems, particularly Windows.
