- **Case Number:** 412524
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** UCLA Health
- **Contact Name:** Eric Caparros
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Website and Documentation
- **Feature:** Help Center
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a disk space issue on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server, indicating that the system was low on EPP disk space.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Previous Ticket Reference:** 30563

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared system/service logs that were consuming disk space.
2. Executed the following commands to free up space:
   - Reduced the size of the journal logs:
     ```bash
     journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
     ```
   - Cleared the PHP-FPM log:
     ```bash
     echo '' > /usr/local/logs/php-fpm.log
     ```
   - Adjusted filesystem reserved blocks:
     ```bash
     tune2fs -m 1 /dev/nvme0n1p4
     ```
   - Removed cached files:
     ```bash
     rm -rf /run/shm/mcache/*
     ```

## Root Cause
The disk space issue was primarily caused by large system and service logs that accumulated over time, consuming significant disk space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the excessive logs and adjusting the reserved block percentage on the filesystem, which effectively freed up sufficient disk space. The disk space warning was expected to disappear within 15-20 minutes after the cleanup.

## Notes
- Regular monitoring and maintenance of log files are recommended to prevent similar disk space issues in the future.
- Consider implementing log rotation or size limits for logs to manage disk space more effectively.
