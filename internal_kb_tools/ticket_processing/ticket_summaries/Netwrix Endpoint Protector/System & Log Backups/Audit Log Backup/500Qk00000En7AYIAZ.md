- **Case Number:** 418849
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Martin-Baker
- **Contact Name:** Conor Lane
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported a critical low disk space warning on their Netwrix Endpoint Protector appliance, indicating only 1.62 GB of free space remaining from a total of 19.52 GB. Despite backing up logs and configuring the system to delete logs after backup, older logs were not being deleted, leading to rapid disk space depletion.

## Environment Details
- The appliance was running Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer had configured log backups and deletion settings but faced issues with the actual deletion of logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings for log backups and deletions.
2. Attempted to manually delete logs older than six months as requested by the customer.
3. Engaged with the firewall team to check for any potential blocks affecting log deletion.
4. Conducted a remote session to investigate the issue further.
5. Reviewed network settings and firewall configurations to ensure proper communication with the server.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the log deletion process, which was not functioning as expected despite the configuration settings. Additionally, there were indications of network issues that may have contributed to the inability to delete logs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the Firewall Provider, who made necessary changes to the firewall settings, allowing the log deletion process to function correctly. After these adjustments, the logs older than six months were successfully deleted, freeing up disk space and restoring normal functionality to the appliance.

## Notes
- Ensure that the log deletion settings are correctly configured and monitored regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to maintain regular backups and monitor disk space usage closely.
- If issues persist, consider engaging with the firewall team early in the troubleshooting process to rule out network-related problems.
