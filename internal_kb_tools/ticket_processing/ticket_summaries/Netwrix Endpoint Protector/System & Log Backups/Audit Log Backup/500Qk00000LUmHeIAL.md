- **Case Number:** 434712
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the scheduled audit log backup was not functioning as expected, and the external repository was not receiving the backups.

## Environment Details
- The audit log backup feature is part of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The customer's environment was suspected to have a large database size, potentially leading to insufficient disk space for backups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session to investigate the issue on the EPP Server's backend.
2. Reviewed the configuration settings for the audit log backup.
3. Checked the disk space availability on the server.
4. Confirmed the functionality of the audit log backup during the remote session.

## Root Cause
The initial concern was that the audit log backup was not working due to potential disk space issues related to a large database. However, it was later confirmed that the audit log backup was functioning correctly during the investigation.

## Solution
During the remote session, it was determined that the audit log backup was indeed operational. The issue was resolved by confirming the functionality of the backup process, which alleviated the customer's concerns.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the operational status of backup features during troubleshooting, as initial reports may not always reflect the current state.
- Future cases should include checks for disk space and database size as potential factors affecting backup operations.
