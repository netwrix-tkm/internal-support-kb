- **Case Number:** 440286
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Technology & IT Data Analyst
- **Contact Name:** Philip Wang
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported a critical low disk space alert from their Endpoint Protector appliance, indicating only 5.8 GB of free space remaining out of 446.21 GB. They experienced application hangs when attempting to back up or delete older shadow files, and the log backup files were smaller than expected, raising concerns about missing data.

## Environment Details
- Endpoint Protector appliance with limited disk space.
- Remote connection was established for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Established a remote connection with the customer.
2. Deleted shadow files from the backend of the server.
3. Monitored server resources since the UI console was inaccessible.
4. Advised the customer to schedule an Audit Log Backup for all modules and retain only the last few months of logs once the server was accessible.
5. Followed up with the customer to check on progress.

## Root Cause
The application was unresponsive due to insufficient disk space and resource allocation (CPU and RAM) on the Endpoint Protector appliance. The presence of numerous shadow files contributed to the low disk space issue.

## Solution
- Deleted shadow files from the backend to free up disk space.
- The customer increased the CPU and RAM allocated to the appliance, which resolved the UI hanging issue.
- The customer was advised to set a scheduled Audit Log Backup to manage log retention effectively.

## Notes
- Ensure that sufficient resources (CPU and RAM) are allocated to the Endpoint Protector appliance to prevent performance issues.
- Regularly monitor disk space and set up automated backups to manage log files effectively.
- Consider advising customers to take snapshots of their virtual environments before making significant changes to the server configuration.
