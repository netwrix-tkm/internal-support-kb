- **Component:** System & Log Backups

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a message indicating that they were out of disk space, which prevented them from backing up logs.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after an upgrade to version 5.9.4.0 of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session to check the disk space in the backend, confirming that there were no issues with disk space.
2. Set up an audit log backup to monitor if it would run successfully.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient disk space on the system partition, which was not initially apparent during the backend checks.

## Solution

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor disk space, especially after upgrades, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
- Ensure that adequate disk space is maintained for log backups to avoid disruptions in service.
