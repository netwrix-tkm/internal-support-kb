## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space, receiving alerts indicating only 67.09 GB of free space available from a total of 257.22 GB (26%). They requested assistance in optimizing disk space to prevent further alerts and potential performance issues.

## Environment Details
- **Appliance Type:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Disk Space Status:** 67.09 GB free out of 257.22 GB

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the disk space usage on the appliance.
2. Identified that the mailer folder was consuming 160 GB of disk space.
3. Cleared unnecessary files and backups to free up disk space.
4. Suggested using the Audit Log Backup feature to manage log storage effectively.
5. Advised the customer to delete older system and audit log backups and tune policies to reduce incoming log count.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the low disk space was the accumulation of large log files and backups, particularly within the mailer folder, which was taking up significant space.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clearing the disk space, specifically by removing the contents of the mailer folder that was consuming 160 GB. After these actions, the disk space was optimized, and the customer was informed that the appliance should no longer trigger low disk space alerts.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk space and implement log management policies to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to periodically review and delete older backups and logs to maintain optimal disk space usage.
