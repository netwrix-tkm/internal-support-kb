- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IT Solutions India Private Limited
- **Contact Name:** Raman Chhibber
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, IT Solutions India Private Limited, reported an issue with clearing old audit logs from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector console. They were unable to delete the logs due to an expired license and required assistance to implement a fresh environment.

## Environment Details
- The customer was conducting a Proof of Concept (POC) for their master India company.
- The license for the product was expired at the time of the request.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to delete the old logs from the console but was unsuccessful.
2. The customer confirmed that they had received a new license, but it was invalid, leading to an import failure with the error message: "import failed. Please use a valid license file."
3. Support team members communicated with the customer to clarify the status of the license and the issues faced.

## Root Cause
The inability to delete the old logs was primarily due to the expired license and the subsequent invalid license that the customer received, which prevented them from accessing the necessary features to clear the logs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the customer received a valid license. Once the valid license was applied, the customer was able to successfully delete the old audit logs from the console. Confirmation of resolution was provided by Vlad Vladut from the support team.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the licensing requirements before attempting to clear logs.
- It is important to verify the validity of the license provided to customers to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Maintain clear communication with the sales team to expedite license renewals or replacements when necessary.
