## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NLgAMIA1
- **Case Number:** 440034
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** GS Elektromedizinische Ger√§te G. Stemple GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Martin Neuhauser
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Audit Log backup on their Endpoint Protector was stuck since March 10, 2025. No new backup files had been created, and the system indicated that an audit log backup was currently running for several hours. The customer suspected a bug and requested a way to abort the hanging backup, which was blocking scheduled backups.

## Environment Details
- The server was running version 5.9.4.1 of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact with the customer to gather details and schedule a session.
2. Scheduled a remote session for April 1, 2025, to investigate further.
3. On April 9, 2025, connected with the customer and deleted the current audit backup from the backend, then saved the configuration from the UI.
4. Followed up with the customer on May 9, 2025, to check the status of the audit log backup.
5. Explained to the customer that if there were no logs, the Audit Log backup would not be performed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of any audit log entries on the test server. Without logs to back up, the system was unable to complete the backup process, leading to the appearance of a hanging backup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting the stuck audit backup from the backend.
- Saving the configuration again from the UI.
- Generating new logs, which allowed the Audit Log backup to run successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that there are sufficient audit log entries available for the backup process to complete successfully. If there are no logs, the backup will not be performed, and the system may indicate that a backup is still in progress.
- Future users should verify the presence of logs older than three months in the Reports & Analysis section to avoid similar issues.
