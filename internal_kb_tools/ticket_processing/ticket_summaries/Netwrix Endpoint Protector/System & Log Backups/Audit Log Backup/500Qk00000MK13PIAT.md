## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MK13PIAT
- **Case Number:** 437062
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** GS Elektromedizinische Ger√§te G. Stemple GmbH
- **Contact Name:** ITS Servicedesk
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Audit Log Backup
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the automatic backup of Audit Log files in their production system was not functioning as expected. Log data older than three months was supposed to be backed up and removed from the database, but the process was failing. Manual backups created a file but did not complete, and subsequent backups remained in a "Backup running" state indefinitely.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the production system.
- The test system, configured identically, was functioning correctly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the Audit setup was correct.
2. Verified that the server was optimized for performance.
3. Attempted to manually initiate the backup process multiple times.
4. Collaborated with Netwrix support (Frau Kurbjuhn) to investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was confirmed that the configuration was correct and that the server was optimized.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Audit process was correctly configured to run and remove older logs. After confirming the setup and optimizing the server, the backup process began functioning as intended, successfully backing up and removing the older log files.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the server is optimized and that the Audit settings are correctly configured before initiating backups.
- If similar issues arise, verify the configuration against a working test environment to identify discrepancies.
