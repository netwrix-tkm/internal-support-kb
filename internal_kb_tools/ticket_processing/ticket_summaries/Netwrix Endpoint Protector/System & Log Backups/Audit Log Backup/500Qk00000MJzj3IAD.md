- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their appliance was running low on disk space, with only 161.89 GB free out of a total of 950.16 GB (17% remaining). This low disk space was potentially affecting the functionality and performance of the EPP Server.

## Environment Details
- **Appliance Type:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Current Disk Space:** 161.89 GB free from 950.16 GB total

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current disk space usage on the EPP server.
2. Suggested the customer use the Audit Log Backup feature to reduce the logs stored in the database.
3. Recommended deleting older system and audit log backups.
4. Scheduled a remote session to address the issue directly.
5. Cleared over 150 GB of older shadows during the remote session.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the accumulation of older shadows and logs, which consumed significant disk space on the EPP server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session by removing over 150 GB of older shadows from the system. This action freed up sufficient disk space, alleviating the low disk space warning and restoring normal functionality to the EPP server.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor disk space usage and perform maintenance tasks such as deleting old logs and shadows to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be informed about the importance of tuning policies to manage incoming log counts effectively.
