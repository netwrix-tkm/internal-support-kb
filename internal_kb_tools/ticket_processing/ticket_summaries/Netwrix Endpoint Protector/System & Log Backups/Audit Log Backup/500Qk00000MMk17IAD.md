- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Fongecloud Information Technology Ltd. (RangeCloud)
- **Contact Name:** Jay Mai

## Problem Description
The customer, MediaTek, inquired about efficient methods or tools for quickly reading or searching large volumes of exported data (millions of records) to external storage. They reported that the current process of reloading exported data from system backends was slow and impractical.

## Environment Details
- The customer is utilizing Netwrix Endpoint Protector for data export.
- The primary concern is related to the performance of handling large datasets during export and subsequent analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered details regarding the customer's requirements for exporting data in EPP.
2. Provided information on how to use the Audit Log Backup feature.
3. Addressed follow-up questions regarding log export, clarifying that logs are exported in a CSV format.
4. Informed the customer that no parsing tools for the logs are available.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the inherent limitations of the system's backend processes when handling large datasets, which resulted in slow performance during data reloads.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Educating the customer on the use of the Audit Log Backup feature for exporting logs.
- Clarifying the format of the exported logs (CSV) and the absence of parsing tools.
- Suggesting best practices for managing and analyzing large CSV files, although specific tools were not provided.

## Notes
- Customers dealing with large volumes of data should be aware of potential performance issues when reloading data from system backends.
- It is recommended to explore third-party tools for parsing and analyzing CSV files to improve efficiency, as Netwrix does not provide built-in parsing tools.
