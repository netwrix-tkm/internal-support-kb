- **Case Number:** 427799
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Geislinger GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Panagiotis Dragatis
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** External Storage - Other
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported two issues related to external storage configuration in Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP):
1. Inconsistent shadowing of files to external storage, particularly for files with Content Aware Protection.
2. System backups created using "System Backup v2" were not appearing on the external storage.

## Environment Details
- External storage configured via SMB.
- Issues observed with shadow files and system backups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of external storage in EPP.
2. Tested shadowing with the "Keep Copy on EPP server" option enabled and disabled.
3. Checked the local shadow file directory: `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\CoSoSys\EPP\shadows`.
4. Inquired about the compatibility of "System Backup v2" with external storage.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the shadowing issue was identified as a limitation in the handling of files with Content Aware Protection, which prevented them from being shadowed to the external storage. Additionally, it was confirmed that "System Backup v2" is not currently supported for external storage, which is why backups were not appearing.

## Solution
- For the shadowing issue, it was recommended to ensure that files without Content Aware Protection are used for testing, as these were successfully shadowed.
- The customer was informed that there is a feature request to include "System Backup v2" support for external storage in future updates.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the shadowing process for files with Content Aware Protection, as they may not be transferred to external storage.
- Customers should be aware that "System Backup v1" is currently the only version supported for external storage, and they should plan accordingly as "System Backup v1" will be discontinued in the future.
