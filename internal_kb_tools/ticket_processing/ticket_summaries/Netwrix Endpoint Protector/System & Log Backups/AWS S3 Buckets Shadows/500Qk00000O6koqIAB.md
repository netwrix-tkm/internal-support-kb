## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O6koqIAB
- **Case Number:** 442231
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** CoreWin Tech
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** AWS S3 Buckets Shadows
- **Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, inquired whether the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server could access an S3 bucket without providing an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. They were particularly interested in using an internal AWS IAM role and policy for this access.

## Environment Details
- The customer has configured all S3 buckets to be internal due to security reasons.
- The SDK in use requires authentication via Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Clarified the customer's question regarding S3 bucket access without credentials.
2. Conducted a remote session to explain how S3 bucket access works with both direct and indirect configurations.
3. Informed the customer that the current SDK requires authentication and cannot access the S3 bucket without the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
4. Addressed an issue where the customer could not download a shadow copy due to an error message indicating that the file was not found.
5. Explained that the EPP client sends logs directly to the S3 bucket, and if communication fails, shadows cannot be downloaded.
6. Recommended disabling the externalization of logs to store them on the EPP server instead.
7. Checked the availability of regions for the indirect artifact and provided a list of supported regions.

## Root Cause
The SDK utilized by the EPP server mandates authentication through Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which is a requirement for accessing S3 buckets. The customer's configuration of using only internal buckets further complicated the access without these credentials.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the EPP server cannot access S3 buckets without the required credentials. The customer was advised to disable the externalization of logs to allow storage on the EPP server. Additionally, they were guided on how to create a feature request for implementing new regions on the S3 bucket indirect artifact.

## Notes
- The current SDK does not support access to S3 buckets without providing Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
- Customers should be aware that if communication between the EPP client and the S3 bucket fails, shadows cannot be downloaded.
- It is recommended to use one of the existing regions for indirect artifacts as listed during troubleshooting.
