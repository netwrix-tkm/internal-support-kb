- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** VicCnS Co.,Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Suil Kwon

- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** AWS S3 Buckets Shadows

## Problem Description
The customer requested the addition of the "Asia Pacific (Seoul) ap-northeast-2" region to their S3 Bucket Region. This request was driven by a recommendation from KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency), which advises that financial institutions utilize a domestic region for cloud services.

## Environment Details
- The request pertains to AWS S3 Buckets.
- The customer is a financial institution, which is subject to specific regulatory requirements regarding data storage locations.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for adding the specified AWS region.
2. Informed the customer about the possibility of using existing regions.
3. Suggested that if the existing regions were insufficient, they should submit a Feature Request (FR) for the desired region.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the absence of the "Asia Pacific (Seoul) ap-northeast-2" region as an available option in the S3 Bucket Region settings, which is a limitation of the current functionality of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Solution
The customer was guided to submit a Feature Request (FR) to have the "Asia Pacific (Seoul) ap-northeast-2" region added to the S3 Bucket Region options. This approach allows the development team to consider the request for future updates.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers about existing functionalities and limitations before suggesting a Feature Request.
- Keep track of customer requests for feature enhancements to ensure they are addressed in future product updates.
