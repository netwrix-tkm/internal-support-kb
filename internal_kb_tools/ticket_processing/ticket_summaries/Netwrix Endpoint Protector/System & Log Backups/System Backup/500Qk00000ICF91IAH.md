- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ICF91IAH
- **Case Number:** 426770
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chronus
- **Contact Name:** Ram Singh
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** 5.9.4

## Problem Description
The customer requested the complete procedure for taking a backup of the DLP Server using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using VMware virtualization for their environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with the procedure to take a system backup using the System Backup v2 feature, referencing page 392 of the 5.9.4 guide.
2. Informed the customer that the System Backup v2 does not save logs and audits, and suggested using the Audit Log Backup feature for those.
3. Clarified that if restoring from a backup, the server version must match the version when the backup was taken.
4. Addressed the customer's concern regarding the System Backup being stuck at 99% for three hours.
5. Explained the differences between System Backup and System Backup v2, including the deprecation of the System Backup feature in future releases.

## Root Cause
The issue with the System Backup being stuck at 99% was not explicitly resolved in the ticket, but it was noted that the System Backup feature is being deprecated, which may have contributed to the confusion and issues experienced by the customer.

## Solution
- The customer was guided to use the System Backup v2 for their backup needs, as it is the recommended method moving forward.
- Provided a link to download the Endpoint Protector image for installation in a new virtual environment.
- Informed the customer that the System Backup v2 contains all configurations, settings, and user details, but does not include logs or shadows, which are backed up separately.

## Notes
- The System Backup feature will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release (5.9.5.0).
- Customers should familiarize themselves with the Audit Log Backup feature for backing up logs and events.
- It is essential to ensure that both the original and restored systems are running the same version of Endpoint Protector to successfully import backups.
