- **Contact Name:** Divya Ramachandran S
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** 5.9.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue during the upgrade of their server from version 5.9.3 to 5.9.4, where the system backup process would reach 99% completion and then restart from the beginning, resulting in a continuous loop without successful completion.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 5.9.4.2
- **Upcoming Version:** 5.9.5.0 (noted for discontinuation of System Backup V1)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the backup process was not finishing.
2. Requested a screenshot from the customer to gather more information.
3. Recommended taking VM snapshots before proceeding with the server upgrade.
4. Informed the customer that System Backup V1 would be discontinued starting with Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0.
5. Explained that the progress bar for System Backup V1 does not impact the server upgrade process.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect related to the System Backup V1 feature, which was not functioning correctly during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The customer was advised that they could proceed with the server upgrade despite the recurring backup loop. They were informed about the discontinuation of System Backup V1 and reassured that the progress bar's behavior would not affect the upgrade. The customer confirmed that they could close the ticket after receiving this information.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers about the discontinuation of features in upcoming releases to manage expectations.
- Always recommend taking VM snapshots before major upgrades to ensure data safety.
- The progress bar behavior for System Backup V1 is not indicative of actual backup status and should not hinder upgrade processes.
