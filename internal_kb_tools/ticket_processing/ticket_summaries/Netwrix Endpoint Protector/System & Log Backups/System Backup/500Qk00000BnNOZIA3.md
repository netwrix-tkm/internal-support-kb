## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BnNOZIA3
- **Case Number:** 411841
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CluePoints
- **Contact Name:** Alexis Vervondel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** 5.9.3.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in migrating from their on-premise Netwrix Endpoint Protector server to a new SaaS solution.

## Environment Details
- Current on-premise EPP Server version: 5.9.3.0
- New SaaS server version: 5.9.3.0
- Client machines: 103 MacOS, 80 Linux, and 17 Windows computers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed both servers were on the same version (5.9.3.0).
2. Advised the customer to create a System Backup V2 on the old server to save settings and configurations.
3. Enabled the System Backup V2 option on the new SaaS server.
4. Provided scripts for changing the EPP server IP for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
5. Assisted with issues related to the MacOS script not functioning as expected.
6. Suggested uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent with the correct configuration.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the need to ensure both the on-premise and SaaS servers were on the same version for a successful migration. Additionally, the customer faced challenges with the MacOS script due to insufficient admin rights on client machines, which prevented manual uninstallation and installation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Enabling the System Backup V2 option on the SaaS server.
- Providing the correct scripts for changing the server IP.
- Advising the customer to uninstall and reinstall the EPP agent with the correct configuration, which ultimately worked after executing the script with admin rights.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct server domain or IP is configured before running the MacOS script.
- Consider the limitations of user permissions on client machines when planning deployments.
- For future migrations, confirm that all involved servers are on the same version before proceeding with backups and imports.
