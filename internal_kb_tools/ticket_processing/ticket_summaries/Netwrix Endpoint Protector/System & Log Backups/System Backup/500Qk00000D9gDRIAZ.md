- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FcBrasil
- **Contact Name:** Lucas Cavalcante
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a system backup process had been running for over 24 hours without any progress or completion.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Backup Type:** System Backup

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team requested information about the size of the customer's database to assess potential issues related to backup duration.
2. The customer provided a screenshot of the backup status.
3. The support team analyzed logs and identified connectivity issues with the server.
4. It was noted that the server was not accessible, which could be due to network configurations or SSL certificate issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in communication between the EPP Clients and the server, which was attributed to an improperly configured or missing SSL certificate.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the SSL certificate was re-imported on the server. This action restored proper communication between the EPP Clients and the server, allowing the system backup process to complete successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSL certificates are correctly configured and up to date to prevent similar communication issues in the future.
- Regularly monitor backup processes and server accessibility to identify potential issues early.
- Consider implementing alerts for backup status changes to improve response times for similar incidents.
