## Problem Description
The customer reported challenges with low disk space within their systems and requested assistance in optimizing disk usage to ensure efficient operations.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically concerning system and log backups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to confirm the issue and schedule a call.
2. A remote session was arranged to assess the disk space issue.
3. During the remote session, the support engineer attempted to clear notifications related to disk space.
4. Follow-up communications were conducted to confirm if the notifications were still appearing after the initial resolution attempt.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the low disk space issue was not explicitly identified in the communications. However, it was determined that notifications regarding disk space were still appearing, indicating that the issue may not have been fully resolved during the first remote session.

## Solution
The issue was ultimately resolved during a subsequent remote session where the support engineer cleared the notifications regarding disk space. The customer was asked to confirm if the notifications were still present after the intervention.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all notifications related to disk space are thoroughly addressed during remote sessions.
- Follow-up with the customer after resolution is crucial to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved and that no further notifications are appearing.
- Future cases should consider checking for any underlying issues that may contribute to low disk space, such as large log files or backup retention settings.
