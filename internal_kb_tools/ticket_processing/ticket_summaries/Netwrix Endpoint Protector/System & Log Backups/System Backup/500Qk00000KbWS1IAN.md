- **Case Number:** 432050
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit
- **Contact Name:** Pete Taylor
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Pete, reported that despite efforts to reduce the size of backups on a server in preparation for migration to a new instance, the backup size remained around 400MB, which exceeded the upload limit for the new server.

## Environment Details
- The backup size was larger than 400MB, which is the upload limit on the new server.
- The customer had already deleted old audit logs, computers, and users to reduce the backup size.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the backup size was approximately 400MB, which was too large for migration.
2. Discussed previous issues and the need for a smaller backup size for successful migration.
3. Scheduled a remote session to address the upload limit on the new server.
4. Increased the upload limit during the remote session.
5. Awaited customer confirmation on the completion of the migration process and the import of the SSL certificate.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was that the backup size exceeded the upload limit set on the new server, preventing the migration from proceeding.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by increasing the upload limit on the new server during a remote session. This allowed the customer to successfully migrate the backup to the new instance.

## Notes
- Ensure that the upload limits on new servers are configured appropriately before migration to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to verify the backup size after any cleanup operations to ensure it meets the requirements for migration.
