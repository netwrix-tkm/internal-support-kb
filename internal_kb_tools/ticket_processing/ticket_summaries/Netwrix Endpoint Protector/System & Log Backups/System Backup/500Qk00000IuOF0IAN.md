- **Case Number:** 428454
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** JFE Engineering India Pvt.Ltd
- **Contact Name:** Ashish Shelar
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** System Backup
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the system backup was not functioning correctly, specifically that it was stuck at 20% completion.

## Environment Details
- The customer was attempting to migrate the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server from old hardware to new hardware.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that there was sufficient space available for the backup.
2. Inquired whether the customer was using System Backup V1, which is being phased out.
3. Suggested checking the server information in the appliance to verify available space.
4. Recommended using System Backup V2 for the migration process.
5. Offered remote support for the migration and scheduled a call for further assistance.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the use of System Backup V1, which is known to have limitations and is being discontinued. The backup process was unable to complete successfully, leading to it being stuck at 20%.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by migrating the server using System Backup V2 instead of the outdated System Backup V1. This newer version is designed to handle backups more effectively and is recommended for future use.

## Notes
- Customers should be advised to transition to System Backup V2 as System Backup V1 will be discontinued.
- It is important to ensure that there is adequate space on the server before initiating backups to prevent similar issues.
- Regularly check for updates and best practices regarding backup procedures to avoid complications during server migrations.
