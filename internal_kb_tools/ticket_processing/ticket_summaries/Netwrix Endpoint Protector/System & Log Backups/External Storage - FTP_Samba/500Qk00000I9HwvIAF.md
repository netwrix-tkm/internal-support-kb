- **Contact Name:** Reinhard Ziemke
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** External Storage - FTP/Samba
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that automatic backups were no longer being performed, which was linked to an authentication failure when attempting to save backups to the file server.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Backup Method:** External Storage via FTP/Samba

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication clarified the discrepancy between the subject ("Authentication failed") and the description ("Es werden keine automatischen Backups mehr gemacht").
2. The support engineer requested additional details and steps the customer had attempted regarding the authentication issue.
3. The customer confirmed that the authentication test was unsuccessful and provided a screenshot of the configuration.
4. The support team requested a meeting to further investigate the issue and scheduled a session with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an authentication failure when attempting to connect to the external storage for backups. This was likely due to incorrect credentials or configuration settings in the backup setup.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Verifying and correcting the authentication credentials used for the FTP/Samba connection.
- Ensuring that the configuration settings for the external storage were correctly set up to allow for successful authentication and backup operations.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the credentials for external storage are regularly updated and verified to prevent similar authentication issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to check their configuration settings and perform test connections after any changes to the backup setup.
