# Ticket Summary

## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C7aZKIAZ
- **Case Number:** 412590
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** System & Log Backups
- **Feature:** Backup and Restore
- **Version:** None specified

## Problem Description
The customer, PrivatBank, reported that the size of the System Backup v2 created in the Endpoint Protector (EPP) console was indicated as 2GB, but the actual download size was approximately 14GB. The customer sought clarification on whether this behavior was expected.

## Environment Details
- **Production Server:** EPP version 5.9.2.0
- **Test Server:** EPP version not specified, but intended for testing purposes.
- Both servers are hosted on AWS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment:** The support team reviewed the reported issue and noted the discrepancy in backup sizes.
2. **Request for Information:** The customer was asked to provide a full-page screenshot of the system information page for further analysis.
3. **Internal Consultation:** The support team consulted with the server team regarding potential underlying issues with the EPP appliance.
4. **Remote Session Scheduling:** A remote session was proposed to access the back-end of the server via SSH for deeper investigation.
5. **Patch Application:** A PHP patch was applied to the production server to address the backup size issue.
6. **Backup Size Verification:** After applying the patch, a new System Backup v2 was created, and its size was verified to be 69MB.

## Root Cause
The initial large backup size was attributed to the inclusion of unnecessary data, specifically the event logs and entities (computers, users, devices) in the backup process. The backup configuration settings were not optimized for the intended migration of only settings and policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Applying a PHP patch to the production server to optimize the backup process.
- Creating a new System Backup v2, which successfully reduced the file size to 69MB.
- Resetting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and manually setting the time on the test server to ensure successful login after restoring the backup configuration settings.

## Notes
- The customer confirmed that only settings and policies were required for migration, and no logs or entity data were needed on the test server.
- Future migrations should ensure that the backup process is configured to exclude unnecessary data to avoid similar issues.
- It is recommended to verify the backup size in the back-end database to ensure accuracy before proceeding with migrations.
