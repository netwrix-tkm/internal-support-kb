- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** StarTech Networks Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Manish Panchal
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** N/A
- **Version:** N/A

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were being disconnected from the EPP server every 3 minutes due to low disk space, which was completely occupied.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Device Control

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the disk space on the EPP server.
2. Identified that the disk was completely occupied, leading to disconnections.
3. Discussed potential solutions with the customer.
4. Deleted unnecessary files, specifically the file shadows, as per the discussion.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the accumulation of file shadows on the EPP server, which consumed all available disk space, resulting in frequent disconnections for users.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the file shadows from the EPP server, which freed up approximately 90% of the disk space, allowing normal operations to resume.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated cleanup processes for temporary files or shadows to maintain adequate disk space.
