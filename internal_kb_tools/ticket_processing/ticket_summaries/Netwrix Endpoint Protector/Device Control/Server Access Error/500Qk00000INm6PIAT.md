## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000INm6PIAT
- **Case Number:** 427277
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DATA Group of Companies, Ltd.
- **Contact Name:** Taylor Waldon
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Server Access Error
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after changing an expired SSL certificate, they were unable to access the Endpoint Site.

## Environment Details
- The application is hosted on Azure.
- The server was restored from a backup, but access issues persisted despite all services appearing to be operational.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected with the customer to gather more details about the certificate and the issue.
2. Scheduled a remote session to access the server via SSH for certificate replacement.
3. Verified that SSH access was enabled on the VM.
4. Attempted to restore the SSL certificate from the backend using WinSCP.
5. Checked network rules in Azure to ensure proper configuration.
6. Identified that port 443 was not allowed in the Azure network rules.

## Root Cause
The primary reason for the access issue was that port 443 was not allowed in the Azure network rules, which prevented access to the UI.

## Solution
- Added port 443 to the network rules in Azure, allowing access to the UI.
- Replaced the expired SSL certificate with a new one.
- Confirmed that after these changes, the UI was accessible and functioning as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that port 443 is always allowed in Azure network rules for applications requiring HTTPS access.
- Regularly monitor SSL certificate expiration dates to prevent similar issues in the future.
