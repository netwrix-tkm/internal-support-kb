## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GnU70IAF
- **Case Number:** 423348
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Sersaprosa
- **Contact Name:** Marisela Oliva
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer, Sersaprosa, inquired about Bluetooth connection records labeled as "noUser" in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector logs. They sought clarification on whether these records indicated established connections or merely connection attempts, particularly in the context of auditing.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Question:** Device Control Detections
- **Logs Provided:** Bluetooth connection logs related to smartphone connections

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs provided by the customer to identify the nature of the "noUser" records.
2. Consulted with the R&D team to gain insights into the meaning of "noUser" in the context of Bluetooth connections.
3. Clarified the distinction between pairing/unpairing events and actual data transfer events during user logout sessions.

## Root Cause
The "noUser" designation in the logs indicates that the Bluetooth connection events occurred when no user was logged into the system. This means that the records pertain to pairing/unpairing events rather than actual data transfers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the following clarifications:
- The "noUser" records represent Bluetooth pairing/unpairing events and do not indicate established data connections.
- The logs reviewed only captured events related to pairing/unpairing and blocking, without any data transfer occurring during logout sessions.

## Notes
- For future reference, it is important to clarify to customers that "noUser" records do not imply active data communication but rather administrative events related to device control.
- Customers should be advised that detailed communication frames are not available for review in the context of these logs.
