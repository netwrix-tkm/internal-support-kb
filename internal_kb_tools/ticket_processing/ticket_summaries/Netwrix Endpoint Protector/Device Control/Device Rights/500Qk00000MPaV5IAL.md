## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MPaV5IAL
- **Case Number:** 437353
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Martin-Baker
- **Contact Name:** Conor Lane
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an account named 'NoUser' appearing in the Device Control -> Users section, which was checking in every minute across all devices. The customer was concerned about the nature of this account and whether it could be removed without causing any impact.

## Environment Details
The customer indicated that the EPP Client was reporting "NoUser" for the logged user on some computers. The account had groups set to "Allow All," which was unique within their environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer collected logs from the affected systems and submitted them for analysis.
2. Technical support followed up with R&D to investigate the behavior of the 'NoUser' account.
3. Engineers reviewed the logs and confirmed that the EPP client did not detect any user logged in at the time of log collection.

## Root Cause
The appearance of the 'NoUser' account is expected behavior when no user is logged into a machine. This can occur, for example, when a machine is restarted and the login screen is displayed without any user logging in. The EPP client reflects this state by showing 'NoUser'.

## Solution
The engineers confirmed that the behavior was expected and recommended that the customer upgrade their EPP server and clients to the latest versions, which include improvements related to 'NoUser' logging. The customer was informed of these findings and agreed to proceed with the upgrade.

## Notes
- The 'NoUser' account does not cause any adverse effects and is a normal part of the system's operation when no user is logged in.
- It is advisable to keep the EPP server and clients updated to the latest versions to benefit from improvements and fixes.
- For issues related to duplicate devices, the customer was advised to raise a separate ticket as it was likely not related to the 'NoUser' account.
