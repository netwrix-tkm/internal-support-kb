## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CCjVWIA1
- **Case Number:** 412721
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) Bank
- **Contact Name:** Megan Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after deploying CosoSys Endpoint Protector (EPP) to 1700 machines, specific USB devices were not being recognized and were blocking access, preventing users from completing essential end-of-day training activities. This issue posed a risk of significant financial penalties.

## Environment Details
- **Deployment:** CosoSys EPP installed on 1700 workstations.
- **Affected Devices:** USB authentication tokens categorized as Chip Card Device or Card Reader (SCSI).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment:** Reviewed the reports of USB devices not being recognized.
2. **Communication:** Engaged with the customer to understand the urgency and impact of the issue.
3. **Configuration Review:** Investigated the device categorization settings within the EPP.
4. **Temporary Workaround:** Sent an uninstall command from the console to 7 workstations to allow users to complete their tasks.
5. **Exception Configuration:** Attempted to set "Allow Access" exceptions for the affected device types.

## Root Cause
Certain USB authentication tokens were incorrectly categorized by the operating system as Chip Card Device or Card Reader (SCSI), which were set to block access by default in the EPP configuration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Setting "Allow Access" exceptions for the affected device types (Chip Card Device and Card Reader).
- Additional device types, including Internal Card Reader, were also allowed to ensure all necessary USB tokens functioned correctly.

## Notes
- It is crucial to regularly review and update device categorization settings to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing a testing phase for new deployments to identify potential device recognition issues before full-scale rollout.
- Monitor the performance of the exception groups to ensure compliance with regulatory tasks and avoid financial penalties.
