## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G23IMIAZ
- **Case Number:** 421634
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Christian Spies
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** 7.2.0

## Problem Description
The user reported an issue where an SD card connected to a computer was visible in Windows Explorer but was inaccessible. The Endpoint Protector PopUp window did not appear to unblock the card, and the SD card was not displayed in the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a corporate environment using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The SD card reader was identified as a "Card Reader Device (MTD)."

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the SD card appeared in Windows Explorer but was inaccessible.
2. Checked for the Endpoint Protector PopUp window, which did not appear.
3. Confirmed that the SD card (reader) was not displayed in the EPP client.
4. Reviewed server logs for any entries related to the SD card connection process, which were absent.
5. Suggested the user connect a USB device to see if the EPP PopUp would appear, which it did for the USB device.
6. Investigated the connection between the Unify server and nodes to ensure proper communication.
7. Applied the 7.2.0 patch to the Unify server and re-tested the SD card connection.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a communication error between the Unify server and the nodes. When a right was deleted from the Unify console, it was not removed from the nodes due to high traffic or previous actions, leading to the SD card being allowed access despite rights being set to deny.

## Solution
1. The rights that were deleted from the Unify console were also deleted from the nodes.
2. After ensuring proper communication between the Unify server and nodes, the SD card reader was blocked again.
3. The user was informed that unblocking the SD card would require manual approval via the Endpoint Protector console, as the self-remediate pop-up did not appear automatically.

## Notes
- After connecting the SD card, no self-remediate pop-up window appeared for manual approval; this must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
- A separate ticket (00440963) was created to address the behavior of the self-remediate pop-up.
- Future prevention measures include verifying that rights are properly applied and ensuring that any communication errors due to load are addressed promptly.
