- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights

## Problem Description
The customer requested a method to collect the Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) from display devices. They were particularly interested in identifying specific devices, such as KVMs, used by their users.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry pertains to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform, specifically focusing on device control and rights management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the EDID data structure and its components, including manufacturer name, serial number, and product type.
2. Investigated the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding EDID data collection.
3. Confirmed that the devices in question do not serve as exit points for data transfer, preventing file copying.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector regarding the collection of EDID data. The devices in question (e.g., KVMs) do not allow for file copying, which limits the ability to extract EDID information.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying to the customer that the devices they were inquiring about do not function as exit points for data transfer. Therefore, it is not possible to collect EDID data from these devices using the current capabilities of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that certain devices, such as KVMs, may not support data extraction due to their design as non-exit points.
- Future inquiries regarding EDID collection should include a review of the specific device capabilities to avoid similar misunderstandings.
