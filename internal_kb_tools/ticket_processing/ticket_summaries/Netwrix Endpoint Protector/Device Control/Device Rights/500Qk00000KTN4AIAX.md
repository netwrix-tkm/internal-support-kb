## Problem Description
The customer reported that a Zebra ZP 450 printer, which had previously been allowed in the Endpoint Protector (EPP), was being blocked despite appearing as allowed (green) in the EPP client. 

## Environment Details
- The affected machine is managed by Intune and is domain joined.
- The EPP server version was initially 5.9.3.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered additional details from the customer regarding the issue.
2. Provided the latest Windows EPP client version to the customer.
3. Conducted a remote session to recreate the allowing rule for the specified printing device.
4. Attempted to download the support tool during another remote session but faced issues.
5. Opened an escalation ticket for R&D to investigate further.
6. Recommended the customer to upgrade both the EPP server and client to the latest versions.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by outdated versions of the EPP server and client, which led to the printer being incorrectly blocked despite being allowed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the EPP server to version 5.9.4.1 and the client to version 6.2.4.2. After the upgrades, the printer was no longer blocked, and functionality was restored.

## Notes
- It is crucial to keep both the EPP server and client updated to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the configuration of devices managed by Intune, as they may have specific settings that could affect EPP functionality.
