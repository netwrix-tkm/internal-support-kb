## Problem Description
Yubikeys with VID: 1050 and PID: 407, which were globally whitelisted, were unexpectedly blocked starting from February 17, 2025. The issue was first reported around 4:30 p.m. CET, although logs indicated that the blocking began at 7:22 a.m. CET. The Operations Team attempted to re-whitelist the affected Yubikeys, but the blocking persisted until the affected computers updated their policies.

## Environment Details
- The issue affected Yubikeys connected to computers that had been deleted from the management console and were not able to communicate with the server until reconnected.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the logs to determine the timing and nature of the blockings.
2. Re-whitelisted the affected Yubikeys globally.
3. Investigated backend settings and communication between the Unify app and nodes.
4. Communicated with the Operations Team and internal engineers to assess the situation.
5. Reviewed the policy update process to ensure correct application of global settings.

## Root Cause
The temporary blockage of the Yubikeys was caused by the deletion of computers from the management console. When these computers were reconnected, they initially had their device rights set to blocked until they successfully communicated with the server to retrieve the correct policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the affected computers communicated with the management console to update their policies. Once the correct settings were applied, the Yubikeys were no longer blocked. The customer was informed of the findings and confirmed satisfaction with the explanation, leading to the closure of the ticket.

## Notes
- Future occurrences of similar issues can be mitigated by ensuring that global settings are only applied after successful communication with the server.
- It is important to monitor the status of devices after any deletion from the management console to prevent unintended blocking of whitelisted devices.
