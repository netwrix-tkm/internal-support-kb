## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L7S6nIAF
- **Case Number:** 433700
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** OUHSC
- **Contact Name:** Chisum Thompson
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** 5.9.4.1 (Server), 6.2.4.1 (Client)

## Problem Description
Users reported that their phones were no longer being recognized as Read Only when connected to computers with Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) installed. This issue appeared to coincide with the server and client updates released on December 20th.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Devices:** iPhones and Android smartphones
- **EPP Versions:** Server version 5.9.4.1 and Client version 6.2.4.1
- **Previous Client Version:** 6.2.3.1 (still showing Read Only behavior)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the timing of the issue in relation to the server/client updates.
2. Checked EPP for Unblocked iPhone events and noted the absence of devices running the new client version.
3. Reviewed Global Rights settings in the EPP console for both Android and iPhone devices.
4. Analyzed screenshots showing the same device being unblocked and then blocked shortly after, likely due to a client update.
5. Searched patch notes and bug fixes for any relevant changes regarding device handling.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a change in the handling of device rights for iPhones and Android smartphones following the updates to the EPP server and client. The Read Only option was removed from the Global Rights settings for these devices, leaving only Deny Access and Allow Access options.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that the "Read Only" mode was not available in the current configuration of the EPP for iOS and Android devices. The customer was advised that the only available options were Deny Access and Allow Access, and that no configuration changes could restore the previous Read Only functionality.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that the Read Only mode for iOS and Android devices has been removed in the latest updates.
- Future updates should be monitored closely for any changes to device rights and handling to prevent similar issues from arising.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the available options in the EPP console to manage device access effectively.
