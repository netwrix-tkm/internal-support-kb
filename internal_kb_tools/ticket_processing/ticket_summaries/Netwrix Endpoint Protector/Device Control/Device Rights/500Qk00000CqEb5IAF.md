## Problem Description
The customer reported an access problem to the console of their client BLUEMARINE, which is hosted and managed by CosoSys. The issue was suspected to be related to previous occurrences of disk space saturation.

## Environment Details
- The server is hosted by CosoSys.
- The specific URL for the console access was provided: [https://mckenht.hosted.endpointprotector.com/](https://mckenht.hosted.endpointprotector.com/)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested access to the server to investigate the issue.
2. Follow-up communications were sent to the customer asking if the server was accessible after initial checks.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the access issue was identified as disk space saturation on the server, which had previously caused similar problems.

## Solution

## Notes
- It is important to monitor disk space regularly to prevent similar access issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to check disk space as a first troubleshooting step when encountering access problems.
