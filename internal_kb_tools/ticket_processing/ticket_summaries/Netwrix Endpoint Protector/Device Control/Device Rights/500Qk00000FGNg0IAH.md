## Problem Description
The customer reported that multiple devices/computers were listed as unlicensed in the EPP administration dashboard. Additionally, some machines were able to transfer data to external USB drives despite restrictions on USB data transfers.

## Environment Details
- The client was not communicating with the server, although it appeared online and licensed on the server.
- The client version did not display correctly.
- The customer confirmed they had enough licenses.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs from the affected clients.
2. Attempted to reinstall the client software, which did not resolve the issue.
3. R&D requested additional logs for further analysis.
4. Engaged in communication with the customer to gather more information and schedule a call.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a communication issue between the client and the server. The client received a certificate from the server, but the server did not acknowledge it in subsequent steps, indicating a potential server-side issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after confirming that the client was properly registered and licensed. The customer was informed that the ticket could be closed, indicating that the problem had been addressed satisfactorily.

## Notes
- Ensure that the firewall settings on client machines do not block communication with the server.
- For future cases, verify that the DPI certificate is correctly installed and recognized by the client.
- Regularly check the EPP administration dashboard for any discrepancies in device licensing and communication status.
