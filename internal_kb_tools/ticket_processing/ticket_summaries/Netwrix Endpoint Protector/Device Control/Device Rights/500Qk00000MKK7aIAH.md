## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite having configured their system to allow only power charging when an iPhone is connected, they discovered that users could still browse the iPhone's storage, specifically the camera roll, and download files to the PC. The customer wanted to restrict this access while still allowing charging.

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered with iOS devices connected to a PC using Netwrix Endpoint Protector.
- The specific setting in question was intended to allow power only, but it was not functioning as expected.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration settings for device control to ensure they were set to allow charging only.
2. Investigated the computer rights to verify if the device had the "deny access but allow charging" setting applied.
3. Awaited feedback from the customer regarding any additional observations or changes.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a known limitation of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector software, which allowed browsing of the iPhone's storage despite the intended restrictions.

## Solution
The case was closed after confirming that the behavior was a known limitation of the product. The development team is continuously working on improving these technical limitations, but no immediate fix was available at the time.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that the current version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector has limitations regarding device access control for iOS devices.
- It is advisable to monitor updates from Netwrix regarding enhancements to device control features in future releases.
