- **Case Number:** 418728
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Global Switch
- **Contact Name:** Felix Tekyi
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** 7.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that USB access was no longer being controlled by Endpoint Protector after implementing security policies for Autopilot devices. Users were able to read USB devices regardless of their group settings (allow or block).

## Environment Details
- The issue arose during the process of transitioning laptops to Autopilot.
- BitLocker was enabled as part of the security policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration settings for Endpoint Protector.
2. Checked group memberships for users to ensure they were correctly assigned to allow or block USB access.
3. Reviewed the security policies applied during the Autopilot setup.
4. Investigated whether there were any conflicts between the new policies and Endpoint Protector's functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by insufficient licenses for the current user base. This limitation prevented Endpoint Protector from enforcing the USB access controls as intended.

## Solution
The resolution involved contacting the customer's Account Executive to assist with the purchase of additional licenses. Once the appropriate number of licenses was acquired, Endpoint Protector was able to effectively manage USB access according to the defined group policies.

## Notes
- Ensure that the number of licenses aligns with the user base to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update security policies when implementing new systems like Autopilot to ensure compatibility with existing security solutions.
