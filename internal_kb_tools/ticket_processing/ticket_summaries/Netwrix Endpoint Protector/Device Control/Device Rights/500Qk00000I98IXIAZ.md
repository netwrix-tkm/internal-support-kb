- **Case Number:** 426623
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen (NNDKP)
- **Contact Name:** Cristian Mihai
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
Users were unable to print from Outlook due to printing being blocked by Netwrix Endpoint Protector. The settings were configured to allow printing, but there were concerns about synchronization issues between the Active Directory (AD) server and Netwrix, leading to some organizational unit (OU) groups not being up to date.

## Environment Details
- Users were operating in an environment where Netwrix Endpoint Protector was managing device control and rights.
- The issue involved multiple users experiencing the same printing problem.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the settings for printing were configured to allow printing.
2. Suggested adding the "Outlook" process to the whitelisted applications under "System Parameters" > "Advanced Scanning Exceptions".
3. Instructed to enable "Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning".
4. Advised to update policies on the endpoint machine and restart Outlook.
5. Recommended performing a server and computer restart.
6. Suggested attempting a force synchronization with AD.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the printing issue was identified as a problem with the user's device configuration within Netwrix. Specifically, the device needed to be deleted and recreated in the Netwrix system to resolve the printing blockage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the problematic user devices from Netwrix Endpoint Protector. After the devices were recreated, users were able to print from Outlook without any further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that devices are properly configured and synchronized within Netwrix to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the synchronization status between AD and Netwrix to ensure that all user groups are up to date.
- If users experience similar issues, consider checking device configurations as a first troubleshooting step.
