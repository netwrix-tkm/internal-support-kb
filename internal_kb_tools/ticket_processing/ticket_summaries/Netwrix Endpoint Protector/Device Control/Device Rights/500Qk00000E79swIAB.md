- **Case Number:** 417355
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Diakonie Herzogsägmühle Peiting
- **Contact Name:** Christoph Zeitler
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with several devices being displayed as "Unlicensed" and "Offline" in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, despite being online and expected to be licensed. Additionally, users were unable to utilize YubiKeys assigned to a synchronized Active Directory (AD) group, even though the devices were authorized.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Device Control

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the online status of the devices that were reported as "Unlicensed" and "Offline."
2. Checked the licensing status and ensured that the devices were properly licensed in the system.
3. Reviewed the configuration of the YubiKeys and their assignment to the synchronized AD group.
4. Confirmed that the devices associated with the YubiKeys were authorized correctly in the Endpoint Protector.
5. Attempted to reauthorize the YubiKeys and re-sync the AD group.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a synchronization problem between the Netwrix Endpoint Protector and the Active Directory, which led to the devices being incorrectly displayed as "Unlicensed" and "Offline." Additionally, there was a misconfiguration in the YubiKey settings that prevented users from accessing them.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correcting the synchronization settings between the Netwrix Endpoint Protector and the Active Directory to ensure that device statuses were accurately reflected.
- Reconfiguring the YubiKey settings and ensuring that they were properly linked to the authorized devices and users.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly verify the synchronization between Netwrix Endpoint Protector and Active Directory to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that all devices and their corresponding access controls are regularly audited to maintain proper licensing and functionality.
