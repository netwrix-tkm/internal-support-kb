## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CGAhHIAX
- **Case Number:** 412899
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kommunalunternehmen Ha√überg-Kliniken
- **Contact Name:** Vanessa Fischer
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The NOX device connected via USB in the ENT practice could not be accessed properly, specifically, writing to the second drive was not possible when the Endpoint Protector (EPP) was installed.

## Environment Details
- The device was tested on a laptop without EPP, where it functioned correctly.
- The issue persisted even after uninstalling and reinstalling EPP.
- The system was running an unspecified version of Ubuntu.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the NOX device was functioning correctly on a different laptop without EPP.
2. Removed EPP and its drivers from the Station21 PC, which allowed writing to the device.
3. Reinstalled EPP, which caused the writing issue to reoccur.
4. Checked and reset permissions for the device with the assistance of Frau Kurbjuhn.
5. Conducted a remote session to further investigate the issue.
6. Uninstalled Samsung Magician software, which resolved the writing issue after reinstalling EPP.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a conflict between the Endpoint Protector and the Samsung Magician software, which prevented writing to the drives when both were installed.

## Solution
- The resolution involved uninstalling the Samsung Magician software, which allowed writing to the drives to function correctly even after reinstalling EPP.
- The team will continue to monitor the situation for any further issues.

## Notes
- It is important to check for conflicts with other software (like Samsung Magician) when troubleshooting similar issues with device access.
- Future installations of EPP should consider testing with various software configurations to identify potential conflicts early.
