## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kv0r2IAB
- **Case Number:** 433138
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Schw√§bische Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Andre Knittel
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** 6.2.4.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading to the latest version (6.2.4.2) of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector client, the ability to transfer media data (specifically pictures) from iPhones to Windows 11 clients was blocked. Previously, with older versions, this transfer was possible even with the permissions set to "Deny Access but allow charging."

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Endpoint Protector Client Version:** 6.2.4.2
- **iPhone Permissions Setting:** Global Rights set to "Deny Access but allow charging"

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current version of the Endpoint Protector client installed on the Windows 11 machines.
2. Checked the Global Rights settings for iPhones to confirm they were set to "Deny Access but allow charging."
3. Reviewed release notes for version 6.2.4.2 to identify any changes related to media transfer functionality.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue on multiple Windows 11 clients with the same Endpoint Protector version.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a change in functionality with the release of Endpoint Protector version 6.2.4.2, which altered the behavior of media transfer permissions for iPhones, preventing the transfer of pictures even when the previous settings were applied.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating to the latest Endpoint Protector client version, which restored the ability to transfer media data from iPhones to Windows 11 clients. The customer was advised to ensure that all clients are running the most recent version to avoid similar issues in the future.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor release notes for any changes in functionality that may affect existing use cases.
- Customers should be encouraged to keep their Endpoint Protector clients updated to the latest version to benefit from fixes and improvements.
- Future inquiries regarding media transfer capabilities should reference the specific version of the Endpoint Protector client being used.
