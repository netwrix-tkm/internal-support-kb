4. During the session, it was confirmed that the system does not support reading or storing Hardware IDs on the EPP server.

## Root Cause

## Solution

The customer was advised to submit a Feature Request if they would like this capability to be considered for future releases. The support team will escalate the request to the Product Team for analysis.

## Notes
- Customers seeking to have the ability to read and store Hardware IDs should submit a Feature Request with detailed use cases and requirements.
- It is important to communicate the limitations of the software clearly to avoid misunderstandings regarding its capabilities.
