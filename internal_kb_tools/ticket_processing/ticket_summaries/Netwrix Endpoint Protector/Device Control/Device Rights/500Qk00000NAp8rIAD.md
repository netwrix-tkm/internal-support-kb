## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NAp8rIAD
- **Case Number:** 439587
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Esds
- **Contact Name:** ManagedSecurity ManagedSecurity
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Rights
- **Version:** 10.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite applying a policy in Netwrix Endpoint Protector to deny access to USB storage devices, users were still able to connect mobile devices for charging. The customer requested assistance in blocking mobile device connections.

## Environment Details
- **Policy Applied:** Global rights USB Storage Device - Deny Access
- **Devices Affected:** Mobile devices (specifically mentioned iPhones and Android devices)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the policy settings applied to deny access to USB storage devices.
2. Requested a screenshot from the customer showing the rights configuration on the computer where the mobile devices were still accessible.
3. Clarified that blocking mobile device access for charging is only available for iPhones, not for Android devices.
4. Followed up with the customer to check if they still needed assistance or if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misunderstanding of the policy settings. The policy to block mobile devices was not correctly configured to deny access for charging, particularly for Android devices, which do not support this feature.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer on how to properly configure the device rights settings to block mobile devices. Specifically, the customer was instructed to deny access to the devices marked in red within the Endpoint Protector settings. Additionally, it was confirmed that charging could only be blocked for iPhones, and this limitation was communicated to the customer.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the limitations regarding device blocking for different types of mobile devices (iPhones vs. Android).
- Always verify the rights configuration on the specific computer where the issue is reported to ensure that custom rights are not allowing access inadvertently.
- Document any specific device types that may have different handling in the Endpoint Protector to avoid future confusion.
