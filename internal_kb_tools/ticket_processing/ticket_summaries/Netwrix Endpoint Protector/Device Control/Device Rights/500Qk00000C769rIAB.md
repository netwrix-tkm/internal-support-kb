## Problem Description
The customer reported that CD/DVD drives, which are recognized as USB storage devices, do not reliably show their content in Windows Explorer. While the drives can be used, the content is occasionally visible.

## Environment Details
- USB devices are generally blocked in the customer's configuration, with specific exceptions allowed.
- The issue pertains specifically to CD/DVD drives being treated as USB storage devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the Minifilter driver option was enabled in "Device Control > Global Settings."
2. Suggested disabling the Minifilter driver option to see if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified, but it was related to the configuration of the Minifilter driver in the Device Control settings, which affected the visibility of content on CD/DVD drives.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Minifilter driver option was correctly configured. After confirming that the option was enabled, the problem with the CD/DVD drives not showing content was no longer present.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the Minifilter driver settings in similar cases where USB devices are restricted but specific devices are allowed.
- Future configurations should ensure that the settings for device control do not inadvertently affect the visibility of content on CD/DVD drives.
