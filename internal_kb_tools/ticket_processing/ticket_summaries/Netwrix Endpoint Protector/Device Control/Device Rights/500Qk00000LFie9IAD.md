## Problem Description
The customer requested a configuration for client notification popups to alert users when they share sensitive information on their laptops.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Endpoint Protector software, specifically the Client Mode settings.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request for client notification popups.
2. Informed the customer that custom CAP notifications can be created via System Parameters > Device Types and Notifications.
3. Conducted a remote session with the customer.
4. Identified that the Client Mode was set to Silent, which prevented notifications from appearing.
5. Changed the Client Mode from Silent to Normal.
6. Assisted the customer in setting up a PII CAP policy, which was successfully tested for email addresses.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the Client Mode was set to Silent, which suppressed all notifications, including alerts for sharing sensitive information.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the Client Mode setting from Silent to Normal, allowing the notifications to be displayed as intended. Additionally, a PII CAP policy was configured successfully to monitor sensitive data sharing.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Client Mode is set to Normal for users who need to receive notifications about sensitive data sharing.
- For future reference, customers can create custom CAP notifications by following the guidelines in the user manual: [Custom CAP Notifications](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemParameters/Overview.htm#custom_content_aware_protection_notications).
