## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to block USB devices for clients using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector.

## Environment Details
- **Server Version:** 5.9.3.0
- **Client Version:** 6.2.2.1

   - Server and client versions.
   - The exact use case for applying rules.
   - Screenshots of the EPP icon from the system tray showing the status of the USB device.
2. A remote session was scheduled to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The issue was resolved during a remote session (RS call) where the support engineer was able to assist the customer in correctly configuring the settings to block USB devices.

## Notes
- Ensure that the device control rules are correctly configured and applied to the appropriate groups, users, or devices.
- It is advisable to verify the status of the EPP icon in the system tray for any indications of issues with device control.
- Future cases should consider scheduling a remote session early in the troubleshooting process if the issue cannot be resolved through initial communications.
