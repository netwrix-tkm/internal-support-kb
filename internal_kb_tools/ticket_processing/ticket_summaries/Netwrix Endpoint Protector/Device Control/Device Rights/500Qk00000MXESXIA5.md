## Problem Description
The user reported an issue where they were unable to unblock an external connected device while offline. The error message displayed was: "Invalid credentials. The connection could not be initialized." This issue occurred specifically when the user was in South Africa, and unblocking was functional again once internet access was restored.

## Environment Details
- User was in South Africa for a measurement/test campaign.
- The affected device was identified as LPTP2043748.
- The user had previously whitelisted external devices to ensure smooth operation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Assessment**: Confirmed the error message and the conditions under which it occurred.
2. **Log Collection**: Collected log files from the affected computer for analysis.
   - Logs included:
     - `epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip`
     - `LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip`
     - `LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip`
3. **Testing**: Conducted tests with the computer both online and offline to replicate the issue.
   - Online tests with correct and incorrect credentials were successful.
   - Offline tests with correct credentials failed to unblock the device.
4. **Escalation**: Escalated the ticket to R&D for further investigation due to the inability to reproduce the issue in other locations (e.g., Germany).
5. **Log Comparison**: Requested comparisons of logs from the offline scenario in South Africa with those from successful tests in Germany.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that the problem only occurred when the user was in South Africa, suggesting a potential environmental or configuration issue specific to that location.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the user confirmed that the functionality worked as expected after several tests. The user was advised to install a test build of the software when they returned to South Africa for further confirmation of the fix. The ticket was closed as the user was not planning another trip to South Africa, making further testing impossible.

## Notes
- The issue could not be reproduced in Germany, indicating it may be location-specific.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should ensure they have the latest version of the software installed and consider environmental factors that may affect connectivity.
- It is important to compare logs from different locations to identify discrepancies that may lead to similar issues.
