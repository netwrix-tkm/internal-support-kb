## Problem Description
The customer reported that more than 50% of their client systems were showing as offline and not connected.

## Environment Details
- The customer's IP configuration was set up correctly.
- The server disk space was cleared as it was 93% occupied prior to troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the clients appeared offline and were not connected.
2. Checked the IP configuration to ensure it was set up correctly.
3. Cleared server disk space to alleviate potential resource issues.
4. Investigated network settings and firewall configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the customer's firewall, which was blocking the EPP server's IP address.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the firewall settings to allow traffic from the EPP server's IP address. Once the firewall was configured correctly, the client systems were able to connect successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that firewall settings are reviewed during initial troubleshooting for similar cases, as they can often be the root cause of connectivity issues.
- Regular monitoring of server disk space is recommended to prevent resource-related issues in the future.
