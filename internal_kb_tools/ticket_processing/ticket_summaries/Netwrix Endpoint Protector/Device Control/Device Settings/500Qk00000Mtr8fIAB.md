- **Account/Company:** ARTE
- **Contact Name:** Luc Vantroost
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** 5.6.00

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their license for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector was not functioning as expected. The console indicated that the license had expired in December 2023, despite the customer believing it was valid until December 2024 due to a three-year subscription taken out until the end of 2025.

## Environment Details

- **VMware Version:** 17
- **VM Endpoint OS:** Ubuntu 18.04.6
- **Host OS:** Windows 10 Pro 20H2
- **Server ID:** 9VYHCB6T

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the license expiration date displayed in the console.
2. Verified the license details provided by the customer.
3. Instructed the customer to ensure the license file was not opened before importing, as this could corrupt the file.
4. Checked if the server ID had changed and confirmed with the customer that it had not.
5. Issued a new license key file for the correct server ID after confirming the details.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a discrepancy in the license file being used. The customer had not updated the license file correctly, leading to the console displaying an incorrect expiration date.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by issuing a new license key file for the correct server ID (9VYHCB6T). The customer confirmed that the new license worked correctly, resolving the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are reminded not to open the license file before importing it, as this can lead to corruption.
- Always verify the server ID associated with the license to prevent similar issues in the future.
