## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Dh2WwIAJ
- **Case Number:** 416373
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IHK Region Stuttgart
- **Contact Name:** Florian Bartl
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where groups with members that had previously been synchronized as system administrators via Active Directory could not be added again to the system settings. The customer requested a way to reset the software so that these users could be re-added as system administrators.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Feature in Use:** Active Directory Authentication

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the synchronization process for Active Directory users.
2. Checked the status of the users in the system to identify any flags or issues.
3. Attempted to re-add the groups and users to the system settings.
4. Investigated the presence of any deleted flags on the users.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the presence of a deleted flag on the users who had previously been synchronized as system administrators. This flag prevented the users from being re-added to the system settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the users that had the deleted flag set to 1. Once these users were removed, the groups could be successfully re-added as system administrators in the Active Directory settings.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor the status of users after synchronization to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to implement a process for reviewing and managing deleted flags on users to streamline the re-adding process.
