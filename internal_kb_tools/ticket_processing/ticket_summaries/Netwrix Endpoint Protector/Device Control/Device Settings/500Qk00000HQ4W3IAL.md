- **Case Number:** 424919
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoSoSys Solution
- **Contact Name:** Seong Yun Jeong
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** 5.9.4.0 (Web Console), 6.2.4.1003 (Client)

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with ADB (Android Debug Bridge) access on a Samsung smartphone connected to a PC. Despite setting ADB access to "Deny" in Device Control, the ADB became accessible when the smartphone was enabled in Device Manager. The customer questioned whether this behavior was a simple error.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a Windows environment with Samsung smartphones.
- ADB access settings were managed through Netwrix Endpoint Protector's Device Control feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the ADB access settings in Device Control.
2. Tested the connection by enabling the smartphone in Device Manager.
3. Observed that ADB access was granted despite the "Deny" setting.
4. Rebooted the system to check if the settings reverted correctly.
5. Engaged with the engineering team for further investigation and provided a test build (version 6.2.4.1003) for testing.
6. Collected logs using the Netwrix Support Tool to analyze the issue further.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a change in how Windows detected the ADB interface classes, which led to the device being recognized differently. After executing ADB commands in CMD, an additional interface was detected, causing the blocking feature to fail.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deploying a test build (version 6.2.4.1003) of the client software, which included enhancements to the device control functionality. This version improved the tracking of device classes and GUIDs, allowing the blocking feature to work as intended. The customer confirmed that the new version effectively blocked ADB access.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the latest client version is used in conjunction with the web console to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to test new builds in a controlled environment before full deployment.
- Collecting logs during troubleshooting can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the system and assist in identifying root causes.
