## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hxt8NIAR
- **Case Number:** 426262
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chapman and Cutler LLP
- **Contact Name:** Veronica Yessa
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when attempting to display duplicate computers in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector interface, the page would continuously load until it timed out.

## Environment Details
- The customer was in the process of migrating their EPP server to a hosted environment in AWS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the issue by attempting to replicate it in a test environment without duplicate computers, which loaded instantly and returned 0 results.
2. Investigated the customer's environment, noting that the duplicate computers had identical fields except for the "last seen" timestamp, which differed by 20-30 minutes.
3. Engaged with R&D for further insights and potential performance issues related to server resources.
4. Suggested checking server load, CPU, and memory usage during the filtering process.
5. Recommended optimizing server resources and increasing PHP memory limits.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely related to performance constraints on the server hosting the EPP application, which could not handle the request efficiently when filtering for duplicate computers.

## Solution
After the customer completed the migration of their EPP server to the AWS hosted environment, the issue with the duplicate computer search was resolved, and the page no longer timed out.

## Notes
- Ensure that server resources are adequately provisioned to handle filtering operations, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets.
- Consider monitoring server performance metrics during high-load operations to preemptively identify and address similar issues in the future.
