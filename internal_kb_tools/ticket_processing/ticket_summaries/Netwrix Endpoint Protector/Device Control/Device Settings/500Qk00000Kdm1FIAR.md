## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kdm1FIAR
- **Case Number:** 432219
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IPRO SIA
- **Contact Name:** Elena Revzina
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** 13.1

## Problem Description
A customer reported an issue where they were unable to mount an ISO file on a Windows computer. The error encountered was a Windows error, not related to the EPP agent. However, upon removing the EPP agent, the ISO file mounted successfully.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **EPP Agent:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the reproduction of the issue.
2. Stopped the MTP scanning.
3. Restarted the EPP client.
4. Started the EPP logs to monitor activity.
5. Noted that no process name was recorded when the ISO was mounted.
6. Changed device control rights to allow all devices, which temporarily resolved the issue.
7. Restricted permissions to only allow CD, DVD, and unknown devices, which ultimately resolved the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by restrictive device control settings within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which prevented the mounting of ISO files. The EPP agent was blocking the necessary processes required for mounting the ISO.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the device control rights within the EPP settings to allow access to CD, DVD, and unknown devices. After making these changes, the customer was able to successfully mount the ISO file without removing the EPP agent. It was also recommended to update the server version and use an offline patch to generate a new client version for further testing.

## Notes
- Ensure that device control settings are appropriately configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to keep the EPP agent updated to prevent conflicts with file operations.
- Monitor the EPP logs for any unusual activity when troubleshooting similar issues.
