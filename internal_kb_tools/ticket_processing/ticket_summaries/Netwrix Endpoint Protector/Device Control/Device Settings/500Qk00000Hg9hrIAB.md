## Problem Description
The customer reported that several Bluetooth devices, specifically those recognized as "Bluetooth other," were not functioning despite being whitelisted. An error message stating "The connected device was blocked" appeared after pairing.

## Environment Details
- Devices affected included:
  - Jabra Evolve2 65 Headset
  - PT-E560BT_HARY/Microsoft Bluetooth printer
  - Bluetooth speaker
- The issue was observed on multiple client machines, including LPTP2071835 and LPTP2045733.
- Server logs were generally unavailable for investigation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the devices were paired with the computer.
2. Checked the error messages displayed upon pairing.
3. Attempted to whitelist the devices locally using their VID, PID, and SN.
4. Set the device type "Bluetooth other" to "Allow Access" as a workaround, which initially worked but later failed.
5. Reviewed log files for any discrepancies or errors related to device recognition.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a malfunction in the whitelisting process for devices categorized as "Bluetooth other." Changes in device rights and settings may have contributed to the failure of the workaround and the inability to connect the devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after a hotfix was applied, which restored the functionality of whitelisting for the "Bluetooth other" device type. The customer confirmed that the devices began working as expected again.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to device rights are communicated clearly to avoid confusion in future cases.
- Monitor the functionality of the "Bluetooth other" device type after applying updates or changes to the system.
- Keep server logs accessible for troubleshooting to expedite the resolution process in similar cases.
