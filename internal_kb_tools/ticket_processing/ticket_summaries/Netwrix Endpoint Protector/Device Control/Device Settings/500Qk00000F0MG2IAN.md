## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the management site for their Endpoint Protector clients. They noted that while their licenses were renewed, they could not find a way to launch the console to manage their clients or adjust settings for unencrypted USB access.

## Environment Details
- The management site URL previously used: [https://lj6siz5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/](https://lj6siz5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/)
- The issue arose after the licenses were reported as expired during a meeting.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the licenses had been renewed.
2. Attempted to access the management console via the provided URL.
3. Scheduled meetings to discuss the upgrade and license status with the customer.
4. Upgraded the server to the latest version of the software.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was caused by expired licenses, which prevented access to the management console. The licenses were renewed, but the server upgrade was necessary to restore full functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Renewing the licenses as needed.
- Upgrading the server to the latest version, which restored access to the management console and allowed the customer to manage their Endpoint Protector clients effectively.

## Notes
- Ensure that license renewals are confirmed before scheduled upgrades to avoid access issues.
- Regularly check for software updates to maintain compatibility and functionality of the management console.
- Document any changes made during troubleshooting for future reference.
