- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported significant PC slowness and instances of Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors following an upgrade of the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector (EPP) client. The ICT Technical team suspected that the issues were related to the recent client upgrade.

## Environment Details
- The issues were observed on multiple laptops within the organization.
- Specific BSOD messages indicated a driver related to Endpoint Protector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to rename the "C:\Program Files\CoSoSys\Endpoint Protector" folder on a laptop experiencing slowness, which temporarily resolved the speed issue.
2. On a laptop that was blue screening, the same folder was renamed, but the BSOD persisted.
3. The customer then renamed the driver file `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\cssdlp20.sys` to `cssdlp20.sys.old`, which resolved the BSOD issue after rebooting.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issues was identified as a problematic driver associated with the CoSoSys Endpoint Protector client, which was causing both the extreme slowness and the BSOD errors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by renaming the problematic driver file (`cssdlp20.sys`) to prevent it from loading during system startup. This action eliminated the BSOD occurrences and restored normal functionality to the affected laptops.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the performance of the Endpoint Protector client after upgrades and to have a rollback plan in case of similar issues in the future.
- Collecting logs and dump files during troubleshooting can provide valuable insights into the root cause of such issues.
- Ensure that all drivers are compatible with the latest version of the Endpoint Protector client before deployment.
