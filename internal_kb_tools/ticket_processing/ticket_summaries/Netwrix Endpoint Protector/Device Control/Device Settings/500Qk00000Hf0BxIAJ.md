## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hf0BxIAJ
- **Case Number:** 425477
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BMW Group AG
- **Contact Name:** Christian Spies
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that local device type settings for whitelisting devices were no longer functional. Specifically, the ability to whitelist devices had stopped working, and local changes made to device types ceased to have any effect.

## Environment Details
- Affected device: LPTP2045733
- Issue involved Bluetooth device connectivity, specifically with a Bluetooth Xbox Wireless Headset.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to change the device type settings locally to "Allow Access" for the Bluetooth device type.
2. The technical support team checked the connection to the server and confirmed that policy updates were successful.
3. The rights for the affected computer were deleted and recreated to resolve inconsistencies.
4. A remote session was scheduled to replicate the issue, but it could not be reproduced in the staging environment.
5. Logs were collected and analyzed to identify any discrepancies.
6. The customer was advised to try the workaround of allowing access for the device type "Bluetooth other."

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a malfunction in the local whitelisting functionality of the Endpoint Protector client on the affected device. This was compounded by inconsistencies in the rights table due to a previous server issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reinstalling the Endpoint Protector (EPP) client on the affected computer (LPTP2045733). After the reinstallation, local whitelisting functionality was restored, allowing the Bluetooth headset to connect successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the EPP client is kept up to date to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If local whitelisting fails, consider reinstalling the client as a potential solution.
- Monitor the rights table for inconsistencies, especially after server updates or changes.
