## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GYS7EIAX
- **Case Number:** 422754
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Florida Lottery
- **Contact Name:** Michelle Stovall
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** None

## Problem Description
The customer requested information regarding the compatibility of Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) with various system types, specifically IBM AIX versions greater than 7.1.x and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Additionally, they sought details on the hashing algorithms used by EPP.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems in Question:** IBM AIX v >7.1.x, Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- **Module in Use:** Device Control

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a remote session with the customer to address their queries.
2. Clarified that EPP does not support IBM architecture.
3. Confirmed that builds are available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
4. Engaged with the development team to gather information on hashing algorithms used within the Device Control module.
5. Followed up with the customer to ensure all questions were answered.

## Root Cause
The initial confusion stemmed from the customer's inquiry about compatibility with unsupported systems (IBM AIX) and the specific hashing algorithms used in the Device Control module, which required clarification from the development team.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Informing the customer that EPP does not support IBM AIX.
- Providing confirmation that EPP has builds for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- Explaining that while EPP uses various hashing algorithms for different purposes, it does not save hashes of files to flash drives. The customer was advised to clarify their specific needs regarding hashing.

## Notes
- Future inquiries regarding compatibility should first confirm the supported operating systems.
- When discussing hashing algorithms, ensure to clarify whether the customer is referring to file hashing or encryption methods, as this can lead to misunderstandings.
- Maintain clear communication with the development team for accurate information on technical queries.
