- **Contact Name:** Shaheed Jardine
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control

## Problem Description
The EPP Server appliance's system partition was reported to be running low on free space, which could potentially affect its performance and functionality.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Collector Code:** Device Control
- **Age of the system:** 3.8 years

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. A remote session was scheduled to investigate the issue.
2. During the session, the Netwrix technician checked the system partition to identify what was consuming disk space.
3. It was determined that the journal logs in `/var/log/journal` were taking up significant space.
4. The technician performed a cleanup by emptying the journal logs.

## Root Cause
The low disk space was primarily caused by the accumulation of journal logs in the system partition, which had not been cleared for an extended period.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by executing a cleanup of the journal logs located in `/var/log/journal`, which freed up sufficient space on the system partition.

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly monitor the disk space usage on the EPP Server appliance to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Implementing a scheduled cleanup of log files may help maintain optimal disk space levels and system performance.
