## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FtGhpIAF
- **Case Number:** 421292
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motorola Solutions Inc
- **Contact Name:** Joe Cutter
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device Settings
- **Version:** 5.9.2.0 (planned fix in 5.9.4.1)

## Problem Description
The customer reported excessive logging noise related to Bluetooth on their Linux endpoints. Despite Bluetooth being blocked in their managed rights, the logs continuously generated messages stating "Failed to stop bluetooth.service: Unit bluetooth service not loaded," even though Bluetooth was not installed on the machines.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 22.04
- **EPP Agent Version:** 2.4.2.1
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.2.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that Bluetooth was not installed on the Linux machines.
2. Confirmed that the logging messages were generated by the endpoint client daemon attempting to manage a non-existent Bluetooth service.
3. Engaged with the engineering team to investigate the issue further.
4. Discussed potential workarounds, including installing a Bluetooth stack to suppress the logs.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the endpoint client daemon attempting to manage a Bluetooth service that was not installed on the Linux machines. This behavior resulted in unnecessary log entries indicating failures to stop the Bluetooth service.

## Solution
The engineering team confirmed that this issue would be addressed in the upcoming server version 5.9.4.1, which is scheduled for release in December 2024. The customer was advised to install this new version once available to resolve the logging issue.

## Notes
- The customer was informed that they could implement a temporary workaround by installing a Bluetooth stack to prevent the daemon from generating log messages.
- It is important to monitor the situation after the upgrade to ensure the issue does not recur. If it does, the customer should open a new support case.
