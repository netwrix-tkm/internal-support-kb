## Problem Description
The customer requested to enable automatic encryption for all USB devices across their organization. They wanted USB devices to be blocked by default and only allow encryption to be pushed to whitelisted devices. Additionally, they inquired whether automatic encryption would impact banking security tokens.

## Environment Details
- The customer has over 100 devices that require configuration.
- The organization uses Netwrix Endpoint Protector for device control.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Connected remotely with the customer (Jovan and Nikola) to assess the issue.
2. Reviewed the configuration settings for automatic encryption and device whitelisting.
3. Demonstrated how to deploy the encryption rule to multiple users or groups.
4. Discussed the process for uninstalling the Endpoint Protector from multiple devices.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from an incorrect configuration of the device rules within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, which initially did not allow for the desired automatic encryption upon whitelisting.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by properly setting up the device rule to enable automatic encryption for whitelisted USB devices. The customer was shown how to deploy this configuration across multiple users or groups effectively.

## Notes
- Ensure that the device rules are correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The customer was advised that automatic encryption should not impact banking security tokens, but they should verify this in their specific use case.
- For uninstalling the Endpoint Protector from multiple devices, consider using a third-party tool or the location filtering option, which requires prior setup on all devices.
