- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Avantor
- **Contact Name:** Karthikeyan Ravi
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device not recognized
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
After migrating several computers from the M&A domain (na.ad.vwr.com) to the new domain (avantorsciences.net), the computers continued to report with their old domain names in the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) console. The customer inquired whether any additional steps were needed for EPP to recognize the new domain.

## Environment Details
- The computers were using the Netwrix Endpoint Protector agent to report their status.
- No Active Directory (AD) synchronization was in place, meaning all computer and user details were pulled directly by the Endpoint Protector agent.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the new domain had not been synchronized into the EPP console.
2. Provided the customer with documentation on how to synchronize the new domain into the EPP console.
3. Followed up with the customer to check if they had started the synchronization process.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the lack of synchronization between the new domain and the EPP console. Since the Endpoint Protector agent was responsible for reporting the device information, the absence of synchronization meant that the console continued to display the old domain names.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer to synchronize the new domain into the EPP console. The customer was provided with a link to the relevant documentation for performing this synchronization. Additionally, it was noted that the Endpoint Protector agent was uninstalled from the computers, which may have contributed to the resolution of the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need to synchronize domain changes in the EPP console after any domain migration.
- It is important to verify whether AD synchronization is in place, as this can affect how devices are reported in the EPP console.
- Future cases should consider checking the status of the Endpoint Protector agent on the affected devices, as uninstallation may impact reporting.
