## Problem Description
The customer reported that a USB storage device, which had been whitelisted locally on a computer, was missing from the device list after being deleted. Although the device was visible in the logs report, it did not appear in the device list, leading to confusion about the expected behavior of deleted devices.

## Environment Details
- Device Type: USB Storage Device
- Description: ASMedia Technology Inc. / USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Mass Storage Device
- VID: 174C
- PID: 235C
- Serial Number: 20D11E8010C1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the USB storage device was deleted from the device list on February 24, 2025.
2. Manually whitelisted the USB storage device again on February 25, 2025, using its VID, PID, and Serial Number.
3. Checked the logs report to verify that the device was still being logged.
4. Informed the customer that devices deleted from the list would not appear again in the device list as per the new system behavior introduced in version 7.2.0.
5. Advised the customer to reconnect the device and update the policies on the Endpoint Protector client.
6. Scheduled a troubleshooting session with the designated developer to investigate further.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a change in the system behavior following the 7.2.0 update, where devices deleted from the UI were permanently removed from the nodes, rather than just marked as deleted. This change resulted in confusion regarding the visibility of previously deleted devices.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by having the customer reconnect the USB storage device and update the policies on the Endpoint Protector client. After doing so, the device was successfully listed again in the device list. The customer confirmed that all previously missing devices were now visible.

## Notes
- Devices that have been deleted from the list will not reappear unless they are reconnected and policies are updated.
- It is important to ensure that devices are connected and recognized by the system after any changes to their status.
- Future troubleshooting should include verifying the connection status of devices and ensuring that the last seen timestamp is updated accordingly.
