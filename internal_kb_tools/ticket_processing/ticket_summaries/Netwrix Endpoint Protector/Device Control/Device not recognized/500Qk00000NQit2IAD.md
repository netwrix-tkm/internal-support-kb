## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the EPP Console was unable to display the device code or serial number for a Google Pixel 8a device.

## Environment Details
- Device Type: Google Pixel 8a
- Operating System: MacOS (implied from the context of the EPP client installation)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to investigate the issue further.
2. During the remote session, checked the EPP client configuration.
3. Identified that the EPP client was not communicating with the server due to missing IP, port, and department settings.
4. Reinstalled the EPP client to restore communication.
5. Installed the DPI certificate, which was also missing.
6. Verified that the device details were now populating correctly in both the local console and the EPP UI.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the EPP client not being properly configured with the necessary IP, port, and department settings, which prevented it from communicating with the server. Additionally, the absence of the DPI certificate contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Reinstalling the EPP client to ensure it had the correct configuration settings.
- Installing the missing DPI certificate on the MacOS machine.
- Confirming that the device details were now visible in the EPP Console.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary configurations (IP, port, department) are set correctly during the installation of the EPP client.
- Always check for the presence of required certificates, such as the DPI certificate, to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Document any changes made during troubleshooting for future reference.
