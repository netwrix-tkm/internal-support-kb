- **Contact Name:** Ingo Knief
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their HP laptops, specifically the HP Elitebook 655 G10 with MediaTek WiFi 6E MT7922 (RZ616) 160 MHz PCIe Adapter, were not recognized by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP). This resulted in the device not appearing in the EPP console or client, preventing management and control of the adapter.

## Environment Details
- **Server ID:** ZPFPQIJF
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 21H2 with the latest patch
- **EPP Server Version:** 5.9.4.0 (previously 5.9.3.0)
- **Client Version:** 6.2.3.1010 (previously 6.2.2.1)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the server and client versions of EPP.
2. Checked for updates and patches for both the server and client.
3. Attempted to identify if the device was recognized in other systems or configurations.
4. Escalated the issue to engineering for further investigation.
5. Provided the customer with a download link for a newer client version.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a compatibility problem with the MediaTek WiFi 6E MT7922 adapter in the EPP software versions being used. The device was not recognized due to limitations in the earlier versions of the EPP server and client.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating the EPP server to version 5.9.4.1, which included fixes for device recognition issues. The customer confirmed that after the update, the MediaTek WiFi adapter was successfully recognized and could be managed through the EPP console.

## Notes
- Ensure that all devices are running the latest compatible versions of EPP server and client to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor for any new device compatibility issues with future updates, especially with newer hardware components.
