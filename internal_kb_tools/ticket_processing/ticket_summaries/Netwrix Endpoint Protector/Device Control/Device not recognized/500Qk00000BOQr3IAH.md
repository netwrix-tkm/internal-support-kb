- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) Bank
- **Contact Name:** Justin Ashley

- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Device not recognized
- **Version:** 6.2.3.0037 and later

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a Zebra USB printer was being blocked and not recognized as a Zebra device unless USB printing support was enabled globally, which was not a desirable solution.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Device Type:** Zebra USB Printer

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the Zebra printer was not recognized without enabling USB printing support.
2. Discussed potential rights exceptions with the engineering team.
3. Confirmed that enabling USB printing support allowed the device to be identified correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Netwrix Endpoint Protector's default settings, which blocked the recognition of the Zebra USB printer without enabling USB printing support.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating to Windows agents version 6.2.3.0037 or later, which included a fix for the device recognition problem.

## Notes
- The fix was verified by the customer, and the case was closed after confirming the resolution.
- Future deployments should ensure that the latest agent version is used to avoid similar issues with device recognition.
