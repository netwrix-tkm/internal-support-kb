The customer reported an issue with the Intel XMM7560+ LTE-A Pro card installed in HP notebooks. The Endpoint Protector (EPP) Client was disabling the device, causing it to appear as hidden in the Device Manager. The device was not visible in the Device Control on the client.

- **Affected Device:** Intel XMM7560+ LTE-A Pro
- **Operating System:** Not specified, but implied to be compatible with HP notebooks.

4. Noted that the device functioned normally until the system was restarted after reinstalling the EPP Client.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration within the Endpoint Protector settings, which caused the EPP Client to disable the Intel XMM7560+ LTE-A Pro device.

## Solution
The resolution involved correcting the misconfiguration in the Endpoint Protector settings. After adjusting the settings, the EPP Client was reinstalled, and the device was recognized correctly without being disabled upon system restart.

## Notes

- It is advisable to test the configuration in a controlled environment before rolling it out to production systems.
