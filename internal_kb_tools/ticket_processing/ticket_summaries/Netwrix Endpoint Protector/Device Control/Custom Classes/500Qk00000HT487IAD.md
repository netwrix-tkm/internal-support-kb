- **Case Number:** 425058
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** InfoVision Labs India Pvt.Ltd / IVL Global
- **Contact Name:** Ravikant Mane
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Custom Classes
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they created an offline temporary password (OTP) valid for 15 minutes, but the user was able to access the device for the last 20 days, which should not have been possible.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Age of the Product:** 13.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Block the device in question.
2. Create and apply an OTP valid for 15 minutes.
3. Wait for 20 minutes and confirm if the device is still accessible.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it appears that the OTP mechanism did not enforce the expected access restrictions after the designated time limit.

## Solution
The case was closed by the customer, indicating that they may have resolved the issue independently or found a workaround. No specific solution steps were documented in the case.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the OTP mechanism is functioning correctly and that time-based restrictions are enforced as expected.
- Future cases involving OTPs should include verification of the system clock and any potential discrepancies that could affect time-sensitive access controls.
