## Problem Description
The InfoSec team reported an issue where a license release request for a specific user was submitted and appeared to be successful. However, the license count did not reflect this change, remaining the same even after refreshing the interface.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector platform.
- The license release was intended to be effective immediately but was noted to be saved for a future release in 30 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the license release request was submitted successfully.
2. Checked the license count after the request was processed.
3. Attempted to refresh the interface multiple times to see if the count updated.
4. Reviewed the settings to confirm the license release was not scheduled for a future date.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the license release being saved to be executed in 30 days, rather than being processed immediately as expected.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the license release was indeed scheduled for a future date (30 days). The InfoSec team was informed of this setting, and they were advised to wait for the specified period for the license to be released.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly to users that license releases may not take effect immediately if they are scheduled for a future date.
- Future requests for license releases should be checked for any scheduled settings to avoid confusion.
