- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hi3LWIAZ
- **Case Number:** 425635
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CoreWin Distributor
- **Contact Name:** Danylo Didenko
- **Product:** Netwrix Endpoint Protector
- **Component:** Device Control
- **Feature:** Custom Classes
- **Version:** NONE

## Problem Description
The customer, Privat Bank, reported issues with the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (EPP) client not collecting the Printer's VID (Vendor ID) and PID (Product ID) under certain circumstances. Many fields in the Device Control - Devices section were empty, which hindered their ability to create custom classes for allowed printers and restrict others. Additionally, some printers were displaying unusual serial numbers.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the context of the Netwrix Endpoint Protector, specifically within the Device Control feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the EPP client configuration and settings related to device detection.
2. Investigated the specific cases where VID and PID were missing.
3. Analyzed the reported serial numbers for anomalies.
4. Consulted with engineering to understand potential limitations in device reporting.
5. Requested additional information from the customer, including logs and screenshots from Device Manager.

## Root Cause
The root cause identified was that the EPP client may not be able to extract VID and PID for certain devices due to:
- The device not being a physical printer (e.g., virtual printers like "Print to PDF").
- Some devices may not have a serial number, leading to empty fields.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that the EPP client has limitations in reporting VID and PID for certain types of devices. It was recommended that they ensure they are working with physical printers and provide any additional logs or information if they encounter further issues. The customer was satisfied with the explanation and requested to close the case.

## Notes
- For future cases, it is important to verify whether the devices in question are physical or virtual.
- Encourage customers to provide detailed information and logs when reporting similar issues to facilitate quicker resolution.
- Be aware that some devices may inherently lack VID, PID, or serial numbers, which is a limitation of the device itself rather than the EPP client.
