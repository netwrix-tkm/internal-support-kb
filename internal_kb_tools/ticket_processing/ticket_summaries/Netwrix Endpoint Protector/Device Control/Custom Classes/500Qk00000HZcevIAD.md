## Problem Description
The EPP client was reported as not connected to the server and had not received any policies, despite successful connection tests and server logs indicating that policies were sent.

## Environment Details
- EPP Client: LPTP2045733
- Server logs and connection test screenshots were provided for analysis.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified EPP client settings to confirm the client was not connected to the server.
2. Conducted a connection test from the client to the server, which was successful.
3. Reviewed server logs to check if the client had received any policies, which indicated that policies were indeed sent.
4. Discussed potential licensing issues that could affect client communication.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely related to a licensing problem that temporarily affected the client's ability to communicate with the server and receive policies.

## Solution
After confirming that the client was able to connect to the server and update policies, the ticket was closed. The client was advised to monitor the situation and discuss any licensing concerns in their next meeting.

## Notes
- Ensure that licensing is up to date to prevent similar communication issues in the future.
- Regularly verify client-server connectivity and policy updates to maintain operational efficiency.
