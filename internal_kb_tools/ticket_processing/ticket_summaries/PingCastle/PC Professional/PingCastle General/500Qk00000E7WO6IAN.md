## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E7WO6IAN
- **Case Number:** 417390
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Helios-gesundheit
- **Contact Name:** Benjamin Steil
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer set up a new PingCastle server and needed assistance with importing old Action Plans and Rules from a previous installation. They found an export button but could not locate an option to upload the CSV file containing the old Rules.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's ability to access both the new and old databases.
2. Reviewed the existing features of the PingCastle server to identify any upload functionality for CSV files.
3. Communicated with the development team regarding the missing upload feature.

## Root Cause
The feature to upload old Rules and Action Plans from a CSV file was not available in the current version of the PingCastle server. This functionality is required but has not yet been implemented.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that the upload feature is currently missing and needs to be added to the product roadmap. As a workaround, it was suggested that if the customer has access to both the new and old databases, they could manually transfer the data by generating a SQL script. This would require planning a call with Mr. Vincent Le TOux, the developer of the product, to facilitate the process.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that the ability to upload CSV files for Rules and Action Plans is a planned feature but is not yet available.
- Future users encountering similar issues should consider manual data transfer as a temporary solution until the feature is implemented.
