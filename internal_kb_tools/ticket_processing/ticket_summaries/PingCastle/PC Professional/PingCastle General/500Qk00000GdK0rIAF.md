## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GdK0rIAF
- **Case Number:** 422948
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Guerbet
- **Contact Name:** Ciprian Lozonschi
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about how PingCastle calculates the number of inactive objects, specifically those that have not been logged into for over six months. They sought clarification on the properties used for this calculation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the calculation method for "Last usage > 6 months" in the PingCastle source code.
2. Identified the relevant code line that performs the calculation:
   ```csharp
   https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Healthcheck.cs#L367
   ```
3. Noted that the `LastLogonTimeStamp` property is used in the calculation, which can be outdated by 9-14 days due to Microsoft’s replication traffic limitations.
4. Provided the customer with a link to a Microsoft article explaining the `LastLogonTimeStamp` attribute:
   ```plaintext
   https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/8220-the-lastlogontimestamp-attribute-8221-8211-8220-what-it-was/ba-p/396204
   ```

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from the customer’s lack of understanding of how PingCastle calculates inactive accounts based on the `LastLogonTimeStamp` property, which can be delayed due to Microsoft’s replication policies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the specific code reference that details how the calculation is performed and clarifying the implications of the `LastLogonTimeStamp` property being potentially outdated. This information helped the customer understand the calculation process for inactive accounts in PingCastle.

## Notes
- It is important to inform users that the `LastLogonTimeStamp` can be up to 9-14 days out of date, which may affect their understanding of account activity.
- Future inquiries regarding account analysis should reference the specific lines of code in the PingCastle repository for clarity.
