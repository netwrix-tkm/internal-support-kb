## Problem Description
The customer, SOCOMEC, was unable to locate and download the installation MSI package for PingCastle Pro, which they had purchased through a partner, Athéo Ingénierie.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **License Type:** Pro License

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was initially advised to check the "My Products" tab in their Netwrix account for the installation files.
2. An attempt was made to attach the MSI file directly to the support ticket, but the attachment did not go through.
3. The customer was informed that they needed to register on the Netwrix support portal to access the installation files.
4. The customer confirmed that the "My Products" tab was empty after registering.
5. The support team made adjustments to ensure the product appeared in the customer's account.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer not being properly registered in the Netwrix support portal, which prevented them from accessing the installation files for PingCastle. Additionally, there was a delay in the system reflecting the product in the customer's account.

## Solution
The support team guided the customer to register as an employee of SOCOMEC on the Netwrix support portal. After confirming the registration, the support team ensured that the PingCastle product was visible in the "My Products" tab. The customer was then able to download the MSI package successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are registered correctly on the Netwrix support portal to access product downloads.
- If a customer reports an empty "My Products" tab, verify their registration status and check if any recent changes have been made to their account.
- Always confirm with the customer after making changes to their account to ensure they can access the necessary files.
