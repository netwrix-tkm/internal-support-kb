## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LyNCAIA3
- **Case Number:** 436038
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Rhenus Assets & Services GmbH & Co. KG
- **Contact Name:** Tim Buntrock
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PingCastle General
- **Feature:** Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite multiple password resets for the admin account, the user continues to reappear in the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute on the Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) after some time. The RODCPurgeAccount command was executed but did not resolve the issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) environment.
- The RODC tracks revealed users using the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The admin account password was reset multiple times.
2. The RODCPurgeAccount command was executed to clear the user from the RODC cache.
3. Additional steps suggested included:
   - Checking if the account is still in use, which may prevent removal.
   - Using `repadmin` to manually clear cached credentials:
     ```bash
     repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>
     ```
   - Using `Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache` to remove stored credentials:
     ```powershell
     Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>
     ```
4. The option to rebuild the RODC was discussed as a last resort.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, it was suggested that the account may still be referenced in the environment, preventing its complete removal from the RODC.

## Solution
After consulting with the PingCastle team, it was determined that the only viable solution left was to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal of the admin account from the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute. The customer was informed of this option.

## Notes
- Rebuilding the RODC is a significant operation and should be planned carefully.
- Ensure that all necessary backups and documentation are in place before proceeding with a rebuild.
- Future cases should consider checking for any lingering references to the account in the environment that may prevent its removal.
