- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Coop Genossenschaft
- **Contact Name:** Lukas Fritschi

- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Lukas Fritschi, reported that he was unable to locate the new Pingcastle Pro installation files. Previously, he could download them directly from the Pingcastle website, but they were not visible under his Netwrix account.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician requested the Netwrix account details from the customer to verify product visibility.
2. The customer confirmed that he had just created a Netwrix account while searching for the installation files.
3. The technician informed the customer that registering with Netwrix would allow the PingCastle downloads to appear in his product list.
4. The customer checked his account and confirmed that PingCastle was now visible under "My products."

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer not having an active Netwrix account prior to his inquiry. As a result, the PingCastle product was not displayed in his account.

## Solution
The customer successfully created a Netwrix account, which allowed the PingCastle product to appear under "My products." He was then able to download the installation files without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware that they need to register for a Netwrix account to access product downloads.
- Advise customers to wait a short period after account creation for products to appear, as there may be a slight delay in the system updating.
