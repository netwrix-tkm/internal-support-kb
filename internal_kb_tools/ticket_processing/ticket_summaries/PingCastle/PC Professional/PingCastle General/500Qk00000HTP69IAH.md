- **Case Number:** 425082
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Lonza AG
- **Contact Name:** Sascha Lang
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported difficulties installing Pingcastle Pro, specifically noting that the ZIP file only contained a `favicon.ico` file and lacked the expected ASPX or HTML files. They also inquired about the compatibility of .NET 8 with the installation, as the instructions specified the need for .NET 6, which is nearing end-of-life.

## Environment Details
- The installation was attempted in an environment that requires the ASP.NET 6 Hosting bundle.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the contents of the ZIP file provided for installation.
2. Confirmed the requirement for the ASP.NET 6 Hosting bundle as per installation instructions.
3. Provided the customer with the link to download the necessary MSI and other files from the Pingcastle backend.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer not having access to the complete installation files, which are available separately from the main ZIP file. The presence of only the `favicon.ico` file indicated that the installation files were not included in the ZIP.

## Solution
The customer was directed to download the MSI and other required files from the following link: 
```
https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense
```
Additionally, it was confirmed that the ASP.NET 6 Hosting bundle is required for the installation at this time.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that while .NET 6 is currently required, they should plan for future upgrades as .NET 6 approaches end-of-life.
- Ensure that all necessary installation files are downloaded from the provided link to avoid similar issues in the future.
