## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EEiXTIA1
- **Case Number:** 417708
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TowneBank
- **Contact Name:** Joe Johann
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** Collector Code
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Joe Johann, reported an issue with scheduling a scan of their Entra (AAD) environment. Despite importing a JSON report from a locally generated Entra scan, the new domain did not appear in the Scheduler dropdown menu when attempting to create a new scan. Only the local AD domain was visible, although the new domain was listed on the "List Of All Domains" main page.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Professional
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the JSON report for the Entra scan was correctly imported.
2. Checked the Scheduler dropdown menu for available domains.
3. Confirmed that the new domain appeared in the "List Of All Domains" but not in the Scheduler.
4. Provided instructions for setting up an application for certificate authentication with the required access level.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the configuration of the application for certificate authentication, which was necessary for the new domain to be recognized in the Scheduler.

## Solution
The resolution involved sending detailed instructions to the customer on how to properly set up the application for certificate authentication. The steps included:
- Ensuring the provider for the certificate was specified as Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider.
- Running the following command with the appropriate parameters:
  ```bash
  .PingCastle.exe --azuread --clientid redacted --tenantid redacted --p12-file redacted --p12-pass redacted
  ```
- If successful, additional lines were provided to connect via API:
  ```bash
  endpoint http://pingcastle.domain.local --api-key {insert API key} --out "SchedulerLogsdomain.local.txt"
  ```
- A link to a GitHub resource for creating the certificate was also shared: [CreateSecureAppCert.ps1](https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/master/Cloud/CreateSecureAppCert.ps1).

## Notes
- Ensure that the application for certificate authentication is correctly configured before attempting to add new domains for scanning.
- Always verify that the necessary permissions and access levels are set for the application to function properly.
- Future users should refer to the provided GitHub link for guidance on creating secure application certificates.
