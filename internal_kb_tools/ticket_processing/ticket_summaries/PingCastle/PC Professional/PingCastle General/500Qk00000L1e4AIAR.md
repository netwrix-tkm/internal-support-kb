- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3.0.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving an HTTP Error 500.31 after updating PingCastle to the latest version and installing the latest version of ASP.NET. They were unable to open the page or access the settings for configuration.

## Environment Details
- **PingCastle Version:** 3.3
- **ASP.NET Version Installed:** v9 (incompatible with PingCastle)
- **Supported ASP.NET Version:** v8.xx

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer copied and pasted the update files into the PingCastle directory.
2. Customer installed the latest version of ASP.NET (v9).
3. Support team identified that PingCastle supports only ASP.NET v8.xx.
4. Support team advised the customer to install ASP.NET v8.xx.
5. Customer uninstalled previous versions of ASP.NET.
6. Support team turned on logging for further diagnostics.
7. Support team modified the web.config file to ensure compatibility.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer installing ASP.NET v9, which is not supported by PingCastle. PingCastle requires ASP.NET version 8.xx to function correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. The customer uninstalling ASP.NET v9 and installing the compatible version, ASP.NET v8.xx.
2. Modifying the web.config file to align with the requirements of the installed version of ASP.NET.
3. After these changes, PingCastlePro functioned as expected without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the specific version requirements for ASP.NET when updating PingCastle.
- Always verify compatibility of software versions before installation to prevent similar issues in the future.
