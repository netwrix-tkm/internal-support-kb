## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OnAV8IAN
- **Case Number:** 444027
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG
- **Contact Name:** Andi Wirz
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that for the past two weeks, the Windows task scheduler was running successfully, and the "last report" date on the web was updating, but no email notifications were being sent. An error message was logged indicating a problem with report importation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message in the scheduler log:
   ```
   Exception: Report not imported (System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: 4/28/2025 6:00:00 AM
   ```
2. Analyzed the stack trace to identify potential causes related to dictionary key conflicts.
3. Confirmed that the issue was consistent across multiple runs of the scheduled task.
4. Identified that this was a known bug in the software.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a known bug in the PingCastle software that resulted in a `System.ArgumentException` due to an attempt to add an item with a duplicate key to a dictionary. This prevented the successful sending of email notifications.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the user to update to the latest version of PingCastle, which included a fix for the identified bug. After the update, the email notifications were successfully sent as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the importance of keeping software up to date to avoid known bugs and issues.
- Monitor the scheduler logs after updates to confirm that similar issues do not reoccur.
