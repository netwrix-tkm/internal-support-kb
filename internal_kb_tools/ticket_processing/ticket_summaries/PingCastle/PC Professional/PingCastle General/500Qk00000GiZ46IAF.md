- **Case Number:** 423065
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Guerbet
- **Contact Name:** Ciprian Lozonschi
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer, Ciprian Lozonschi, requested clarification on how the P-ProtectedUsers check is calculated in PingCastle. They observed that certain users, whom they believed should not be included, were present in the report output.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the P-ProtectedUsers check process within PingCastle.
2. Confirmed the criteria used to determine user inclusion in the report.
3. Explained the relationship between privileged groups and the "Protected Users" group.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of how PingCastle identifies users in the report. The tool checks all users in privileged groups and verifies their membership in the "Protected Users" group. Users not in this group are included in the report.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying the functionality of the P-ProtectedUsers check:
- PingCastle checks all users in privileged groups.
- It verifies if these users are members of the "Protected Users" group.
- Users who are not members of the "Protected Users" group are displayed in the report.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand the criteria for inclusion in the P-ProtectedUsers report to avoid confusion in future assessments.
- Ensure that users are aware of their group memberships to accurately interpret report outputs.
