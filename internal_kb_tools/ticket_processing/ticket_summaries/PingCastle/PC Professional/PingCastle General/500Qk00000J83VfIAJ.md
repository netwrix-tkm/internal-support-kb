- **Case Number:** 428974
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CDC HABITAT
- **Contact Name:** Jimenez David
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PingCastle Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading from PingCastle Pro version 3.2.0.1 to 3.3.0.1, the application crashed when attempting to send scheduled reports via email. The application logs indicated a crash due to a `FileNotFoundException`.

## Environment Details
- Previous Version: PingCastle Pro 3.2.0.1
- Updated Version: PingCastle Pro 3.3.0.1
- .NET Framework Version: v4.0.30319 (upgraded to 4.7.2)
- ASP.NET Core Runtime Version: 8.0.11 Hosting Bundle

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the application version post-update (confirmed as 3.3.0.1).
2. Checked application logs for error events (Event IDs 1000 and 1026).
3. Identified the exception details indicating a `FileNotFoundException` in `HttpClientHelper.EnableLoging`.
4. Suggested upgrading the .NET Framework to version 4.7.2.
5. Awaited customer confirmation on whether the issue persisted after the .NET upgrade.

## Root Cause
The application crash was caused by an unhandled exception (`FileNotFoundException`) in the PingCastle application, likely due to compatibility issues with the .NET Framework version being used prior to the upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the .NET Framework from v4.0.30319 to v4.7.2. After this upgrade, the application was able to send scheduled reports without crashing.

## Notes
- After resolving the initial issue, the customer reported a new error related to an image in the report. This issue was acknowledged and a bug fix is expected to be released soon.
- It is recommended to ensure that the .NET Framework is updated to at least version 4.7.2 when upgrading PingCastle to avoid similar issues in the future.
