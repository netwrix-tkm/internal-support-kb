## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FDeAIIA1
- **Case Number:** 419721
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nordzucker AG
- **Contact Name:** Nadine Hermle
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the `pwdlastset` report generated by PingCastle was incorrect, indicating "never" for password changes, while the actual data from Active Directory showed frequent changes.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed while running PingCastle on a server within the Nordzucker AG domain.
- The customer was using an admin account with the highest privileges.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue by checking the `pwdlastset` attribute for the user in question using PowerShell.
2. Suggested running PingCastle with elevated permissions ("Run as admin").
3. Provided patched versions of PingCastle that enforce elevation.
4. Asked the customer to verify if the issue persisted after using the elevated versions.
5. Discussed potential permission issues and the need for running the tool in the same user context.
6. Scheduled a remote session to further investigate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a misunderstanding regarding the display of data in PingCastle. The customer was looking at the wrong data in the report, leading to the belief that the `pwdlastset` attribute was not being updated correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the display of data in PingCastle. The customer was informed that the report was functioning correctly, and the "never" status was a misunderstanding of the report's output. A remote session was conducted to ensure the customer understood how to interpret the data correctly.

## Notes
- It is important for users to verify the context in which they are running PingCastle and to ensure they are interpreting the report data correctly.
- Future users should be advised to double-check the data against Active Directory directly if discrepancies arise.
