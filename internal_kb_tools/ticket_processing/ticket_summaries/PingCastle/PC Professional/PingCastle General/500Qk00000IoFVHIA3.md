- **Case Number:** 428150
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Exide Technologies SAS
- **Contact Name:** Rhondel Herrera
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PingCastle General
- **Feature:** General Reporting
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in deleting old reports captured by the PingCastle Tool.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using the Pro version of PingCastle.
- The tool is installed locally and accessed via a web interface.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Informed the customer that the Pro version allows for archiving reports, which retains data but prevents updates and claims back a license for the domain.
2. Provided instructions to navigate to the Configuration > Settings section to delete old data.
3. Suggested accessing the specific URL to delete a domain: `http://localhost/Database/DeleteDomain/1`.
4. Clarified that there is no option to delete specific reports; only entire domains can be deleted in the Enterprise version.
5. Discussed the possibility of setting a retention period (e.g., 120 days) to automatically remove data older than that timeframe.

## Root Cause
The inability to delete specific reports is a limitation of the PingCastle Pro version. The tool allows for archiving but does not support selective deletion of individual reports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer on how to archive reports and delete old data through the settings. The customer was informed that setting a retention period would automatically remove data older than the specified duration, effectively managing report history without manual deletions.

## Notes
- The customer should be aware that once data is removed due to the retention settings, it cannot be recovered.
- A feature request was noted for the development team to consider adding the ability to delete specific reports in future releases.
- It is recommended to regularly review the settings to ensure compliance with data retention policies.
