## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EcETKIA3
- **Case Number:** 418429
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** wwutilities
- **Contact Name:** Alex Wan
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PingCastle General
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating PingCastlePro to version 3.2.1, the application was displaying as the free version (3.2.0) when running the executable, despite the portal indicating that they had a pro license.

## Environment Details
- **Application Version:** 3.2.1 (displayed on the executable)
- **License Status:** Pro license confirmed in the portal and in the configuration file.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the version of PingCastlePro being executed.
2. Checked the license information in the `appsettings.Production.json` file, confirming the presence of the pro license.
3. Reviewed the configuration settings to ensure they were correctly set up.
4. Updated the `pingcastle.config` file with the correct license key.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `pingcastle.config` file not containing the correct license key, which led the application to default to the free version.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating the `pingcastle.config` file with the correct pro license key. After this update, the application correctly recognized the pro version and functioned as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `pingcastle.config` file is always updated with the correct license key after any installation or update to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify the license status in both the application and the portal to ensure consistency.
