- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while attempting to install PingCastle, following the installation guide provided by Netwrix. During the database creation on the same server, the installation failed with the error code 26021, indicating an unexpected error.

## Environment Details
- **Installation Method:** .msi package
- **Error Codes Encountered:** 26021, 1603
- **Script Involved:** GrantApplicationPoolToSql.ps1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that all installation requirements were met as per the Netwrix PingCastle Pro Install Guide.
2. Attempted to run the .msi installation while generating logs.
3. Identified that the installation failed with error code 1603 during the execution of `GrantApplicationPoolToSql`.
4. Investigated the possibility of a missing or inaccessible `GrantApplicationPoolToSql.ps1` script.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the installation failure was not definitively identified. However, it was suspected that the issue was related to the `GrantApplicationPoolToSql.ps1` script being either missing or inaccessible during the installation process.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, a custom installation method was performed instead of the standard .msi installation. This approach bypassed the error encountered during the initial installation attempt.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `GrantApplicationPoolToSql.ps1` script is present and accessible before attempting installation.
- Future installations should be monitored for similar error codes, particularly 26021 and 1603, to expedite troubleshooting.
- It is advisable to generate logs during installation to assist in diagnosing issues promptly.
