- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ranger Marketing & Vertriebs GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Damian Babik
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Professional
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.1.0

## Problem Description
The customer, Ranger Marketing & Vertriebs GmbH, requested assistance in updating their Ping Castle Pro software from version 3.2.1.0 to 3.3.0.1 and inquired about obtaining the new Pro-File for the update installation.

## Environment Details
- Current version: Ping Castle Pro v3.2.1.0
- Target version: Ping Castle Pro v3.3.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Advised the customer to log in to their Netwrix account to access the latest downloads.
2. Provided instructions for the upgrade process, including:
   - Backing up the database and original PingCastlePro directory.
   - Stopping IIS.
   - Upgrading ASP.NET from version 3.2 to 3.3.
   - Extracting the new version over the existing installation directory.
   - Ensuring all prerequisites were met before restarting IIS.
3. Investigated licensing issues when the customer reported that generated reports indicated they were using the Basic Edition despite having a Pro license.
4. Confirmed that the appsettings.production.json file was not updated during the installation process.
5. Set up a call to review the licensing issue in detail.
6. Provided a new license file after confirming the issue was a bug in the current version.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a bug in the PingCastle Pro software where the license was not properly applied after the update. The appsettings.production.json file, which contains the license information, was not updated or replaced during the upgrade process.

## Solution
- A new license file was provided to the customer, which they successfully applied.
- The customer was instructed to validate the license through the PingCastlePro WebUI.
- It was confirmed that the automatically generated reports were functioning correctly, while manually generated reports still had discrepancies due to the licensing issue.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the appsettings.production.json file is correctly updated with the Pro license after any software upgrade.
- Customers should be advised to back up their configuration files before performing updates to prevent loss of critical settings.
- Future updates should include checks to ensure that licensing information is retained and correctly applied post-upgrade.
