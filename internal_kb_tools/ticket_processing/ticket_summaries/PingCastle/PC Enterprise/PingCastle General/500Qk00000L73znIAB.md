## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L73znIAB
- **Case Number:** 433666
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eurofins GSC IT Poland Sp. z.o.o.
- **Contact Name:** Korepu Akhil Kumar
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
During the deployment of Pingcastle Enterprise on one of the domains, the customer encountered a "Login failed (The operation has timed out)" error while running a scheduled task. This issue arose despite following all documented steps for the deployment.

## Environment Details
- **Version in use:** 3.2.0.0
- **API URL being tested:** `https://pce.itaz-g-100.eurofinseu.com/api/release`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Tested the API connection using PowerShell.
2. Reviewed the API communication between servers.
3. Checked the validity of certificates.
4. Assessed the Single Sign-On (SSO) setup, identifying potential SSO authentication issues.
5. Confirmed that the issue was not related to a firewall.
6. Tested the connection over HTTP, which returned successful results (200 status codes).
7. Encountered issues with HTTPS, receiving an RST response, possibly linked to the load balancer.
8. Checked the Event Viewer for .NET runtime and application stop errors related to login failures.
9. Troubleshot PowerShell file compatibility issues due to .NET version mismatches.
10. Reviewed new API rules on AWS for `/swagger`.
11. Identified issues with the load balancer's second rule affecting the SSO process.
12. Noted improper CPU allocation for running services.
13. Found that the certificate was not set properly, impacting the API connection.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a combination of improper certificate configuration and issues related to the Fortigate firewall, which had undergone faulty upgrades. These factors led to the failure of the API connection.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the technical team worked with the client to correct the certificate implementation and address the Fortigate firewall issues. Once these changes were made, the API connection functioned correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that certificates are correctly configured to avoid similar API connection issues in the future.
- Monitor firewall settings and configurations, especially after upgrades, to prevent disruptions in service.
- Regularly review SSO setups and their interactions with API connections to identify potential authentication issues early.
