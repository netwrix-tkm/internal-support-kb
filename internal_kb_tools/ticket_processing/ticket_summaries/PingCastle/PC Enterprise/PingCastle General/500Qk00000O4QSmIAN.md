- **Case Number:** 442107
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eurofins GSC IT Poland Sp. z.o.o.
- **Contact Name:** Korepu Akhil Kumar
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the KPI report was displaying domains ending with ".onmicrosoft.com" that were not onboarded, leading to confusion regarding their relevance in the report.

## Environment Details
The customer's environment was configured as a hybrid system, integrating both local and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) domains.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the hybrid configuration of the customer's environment.
2. Advised the customer to navigate to the PingCastle console.
3. Provided instructions to modify the status of the Azure domains in the report:
   - Go to **Infrastructure > Azure**.
   - Locate and select the desired domain.
   - Click on **Edit** and change the status to either "Not in Scope" or "Removed".
4. Clarified the implications of each status option on the KPI report visibility.

## Root Cause
The appearance of the Azure AD domains in the KPI report was due to the hybrid configuration of the customer's environment, which included both local and cloud domains. This setup caused Azure tenants to be included in the PingCastle report, which was outside the intended scope for the customer.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to exclude the Azure AD domains from the KPI report. The customer was instructed to set the status of these domains to "Not in Scope" or "Removed" to prevent them from affecting the KPI scores. Additionally, it was recommended to follow best practices to manage the scores for these domains, as they are integral to the hybrid environment.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that hybrid environments are correctly configured to avoid confusion in reporting.
- When excluding domains, selecting "Removed" will eliminate them from the report entirely, while "Not in Scope" may still allow them to appear in certain views.
- Future cases involving hybrid environments should consider the implications of Azure AD integration on reporting metrics.
