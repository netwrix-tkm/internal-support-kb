## Problem Description
The customer, Thomas Bozzini, requested guidance on how to exclude specific findings from a PingCastle rule scan that he identified as false positives, without completely disabling the rule.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Enterprise
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial response provided instructions to use the PingCastle configuration file to customize scan settings.

3. Advised saving changes and rerunning the scan.
4. Clarified the need to click on the "No Action Plan" icon to create exclusions.
5. Confirmed that a `--Level Full` scan should be performed for the exclusions to take effect.
6. Requested details of the specific false positives to provide tailored guidance.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of how to properly configure exclusions in the PingCastle tool. The customer was unsure about the location of the configuration file and the process to exclude specific findings.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Instructing the customer to use the "No Action Plan" icon to create exclusions for specific machines.
- Providing an example of how to use the `Exclude` parameter in the configuration file to specify findings to be excluded.
- Confirming that the customer should ensure they were performing a `--Level Full` scan to apply the exclusions correctly.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be familiar with the PingCastle configuration file and its parameters to effectively manage exclusions.
- Future users should be reminded to verify the scan level and ensure they are using the correct icons in the interface to avoid confusion.
- Consider providing additional documentation or a quick reference guide for common configurations and exclusions in PingCastle to assist users in similar situations.
