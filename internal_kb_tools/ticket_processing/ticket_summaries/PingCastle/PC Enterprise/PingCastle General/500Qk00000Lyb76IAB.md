## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Lyb76IAB
- **Case Number:** 436055
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ASMPT
- **Contact Name:** Gareth Harries
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer requested in-depth documentation regarding the creation of rules and the use of the "Rule Item to Handle" field in PingCastle. They expressed a need for functionality that would allow a single rule to handle multiple values, thereby avoiding redundant configurations when managing exclusions for multiple accounts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Current Limitation:** The existing implementation requires users to apply the same rule separately to multiple accounts, with no support for batch handling of exceptions or action plans.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing documentation related to the "Rule Item to Handle" field.
2. Confirmed the current limitations of the feature, specifically the inability to handle multiple values within a single rule.
3. Discussed potential enhancements with the development team to allow for batch processing of rules.

## Root Cause
The limitation stems from the original implementation of the "Rule Item to Handle" feature, which does not support batch handling of exceptions or action plans. This design choice results in the need for redundant configurations when managing multiple exclusions.

## Solution
The case was resolved by documenting the customer's request for enhancement and forwarding it to the development team for consideration. The proposed enhancement includes:
- Allowing the "Rule Item to Handle" option to accept multiple values within a single rule.
- Introducing functionality to add exceptions or action plans for multiple items simultaneously.

The customer was informed that this feature is currently not a priority and there is no estimated time of arrival (ETA) for implementation.

## Notes
- There is currently no workflow available to add exceptions or action plans for multiple items at once.
- Future enhancements to the "Rule Item to Handle" feature should be monitored for updates, as they may significantly improve user experience in managing rules within PingCastle.
