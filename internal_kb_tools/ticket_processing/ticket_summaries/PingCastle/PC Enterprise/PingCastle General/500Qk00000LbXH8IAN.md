- **Case Number:** 435090
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Euronext Technolog. Unipessoal LDA
- **Contact Name:** Emmanuel Broggi
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3.0.8

## Problem Description
The PingCastle report incorrectly indicated that Windows LAPS was not deployed on any Windows 10 (22H2) computers, despite it being fully deployed across both servers and workstations. This issue was related to how PingCastle processed Windows LAPS versus Legacy LAPS data.

## Environment Details
- Windows 10 (22H2) systems
- Servers and workstations with Windows LAPS deployed

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Deployed Windows LAPS across multiple systems (Windows 10 22H2, servers, and workstations).
2. Ran a PingCastle Enterprise scan.
3. Navigated to the LAPS reporting section within the unlocked report.
4. Observed that the report did not recognize Windows LAPS on Windows 10 devices.
5. Verified the LAPS Distribution Graph, which recognized Windows LAPS but did not reflect it in other reporting areas.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the PingCastle report's failure to properly include Windows LAPS in its analysis. The "Number of LAPS Installed" metric was designed solely for Legacy LAPS, and the Excel export and dashboard pie charts did not account for Windows LAPS.

## Solution
A fix was implemented in a new version of PingCastle (3.3.0.8) to properly detect and differentiate Windows LAPS. The following adjustments were made to the report:
- Renamed the “Number of LAPS Installed” column to “Legacy LAPS”.
- Added a new column “Microsoft LAPS” to track Windows LAPS separately.
- Introduced a “Combined Total” column summing both Legacy LAPS and Microsoft LAPS values.
- Updated pie charts to accurately reflect Windows LAPS data.

Users were advised to update to the latest version to ensure accurate LAPS reporting.

## Notes
- Ensure that future reports differentiate between Legacy LAPS and Windows LAPS to avoid similar issues.
- Users should always keep PingCastle updated to benefit from the latest fixes and features.
