- **Case Number:** 439278
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Thales Group
- **Contact Name:** Julien Maltaverne
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** Collector
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the "DoListObject" control, which is an informative rule. They were blocked at oradad level 2 despite the global domain risk level being 0. This issue was linked to the implementation of the red forest model with a masking administration Organizational Unit (OU).

## Environment Details
- The customer has implemented a red forest model with masking administration OU.
- The "DoListObject" parameter was set, which contributed to the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the configuration of the "DoListObject" control.
2. Reviewed the global domain risk level settings.
3. Identified that the custom maturity level was not set, which was causing the blockage.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the custom maturity level not being set, which resulted in the "DoListObject" control blocking the process at oradad level 2.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer to use the custom rules feature in the PingCastle configuration. Specifically, they were instructed to navigate to **Configuration -> Custom Rules** and change the maturity level to resolve the blockage.

## Notes
- Ensure that the custom maturity level is set appropriately when implementing controls like "DoListObject" to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to review the configuration settings after implementing significant changes, such as a red forest model, to ensure all parameters are correctly set.
