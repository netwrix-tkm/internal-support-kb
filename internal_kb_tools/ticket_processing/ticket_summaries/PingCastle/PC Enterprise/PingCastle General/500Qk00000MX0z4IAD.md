## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MX0z4IAD
- **Case Number:** 437607
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eurofins GSC IT Poland Sp. z.o.o.
- **Contact Name:** Korepu Akhil Kumar
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The stale object rule "Number of computers without password change for at least 3 months: 14" incorrectly flagged 14 computer accounts as vulnerable, despite their passwords having been recently changed. Additionally, some computer accounts displayed future timestamps under the last used attribute.

## Environment Details
- The issue was identified during a PingCastle security scan.
- The affected attributes in Active Directory include `pwdLastSet` and `lastLogonTimestamp`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Reproduce the Issue:**
   - Run a PingCastle security scan focusing on stale object rules.
   - Observe that the rule flags 14 computer accounts.
   - Verify that these accounts have recently updated their passwords.
   - Check the last used timestamps for these accounts, noting any future values.

2. **Validate Active Directory Attributes:**
   - Execute the following PowerShell command to confirm `pwdLastSet` and `lastLogonTimestamp` values:
     ```powershell
     Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp | 
     Where-Object { $_.Name -in @("Computer1", "Computer2", ...) } | 
     Select-Object Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp
     ```

3. **Verify Domain Controller Replication:**
   - Run the command:
     ```shell
     repadmin /showrepl
     ```
   - Ensure replication is functioning properly and data is consistent across domain controllers.

4. **Test Manual Password Reset:**
   - Reset the password for one affected computer and check if the timestamps update correctly.

5. **Check Domain Controller Time Synchronization:**
   - Run the command:
     ```shell
     w32tm /query /status
     ```
   - Identify any inconsistencies in time settings across domain controllers.

6. **Review PingCastle's Handling of Timestamps:**
   - Validate whether PingCastle is correctly processing timestamps and handling future dates.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by:
- **Future Timestamps in Active Directory:** Some computer accounts had incorrect timestamps, leading to misinterpretation by PingCastle.
- **Replication Delays:** Out-of-sync domain controllers provided stale data, affecting the accuracy of the stale object rule.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
1. Confirming the accuracy of the `pwdLastSet` and `lastLogonTimestamp` attributes for the affected computers.
2. Ensuring that domain controller replication was functioning correctly.
3. Resetting the password for one of the affected computers, which updated the timestamps correctly, indicating that replication delays or time drift were contributing factors.
4. Synchronizing time settings across domain controllers to prevent future discrepancies.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that all domain controllers are synchronized and that time settings are consistent to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Future timestamps in Active Directory should be monitored, as they can lead to false positives in security assessments.
- If issues persist after following the above steps, consider reporting a potential bug or logic flaw in PingCastle's handling of timestamps.
