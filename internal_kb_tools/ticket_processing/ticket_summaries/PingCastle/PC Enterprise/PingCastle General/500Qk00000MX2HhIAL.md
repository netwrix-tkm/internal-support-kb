## Problem Description
The customer requested information regarding the API capabilities of PingCastle to fetch specific details from the PingCastle Console. The end-users found it challenging to locate these details after downloading reports.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle

   - Findings for each section, their scores, and the organization where findings were discovered.
   - Tables for admin users, user accounts with never-expiring passwords, password policies, and DNS admins.
3. Provided the customer with the relevant API endpoints to access the requested data:
   - Total scores: `/api/reports`
   - Findings: `/api/Rules/RulesMatched`
   - Admin users: `/api/Reports/{id}` (navigate to `privilegedGroups`)
   - User accounts with never-expiring passwords: `/api/Reports/{id}` (navigate to `userAccountData`)
   - Password policies: `/api/Reports/{id}` (navigate to `gppPasswordPolicy`)
   - DNS admins: `/api/Reports/{id}` (navigate to `privilegedGroups`)

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of knowledge regarding the available API endpoints in PingCastle that could provide the required data, leading to difficulties in retrieving information from downloaded reports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed information about the available API endpoints in PingCastle. This allowed them to fetch the required data directly from the API, thus eliminating the need to manually search through downloaded reports.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the API documentation and endpoints available in PingCastle for future queries.
- Encourage customers to reach out for assistance if they encounter difficulties in using the API or if they have specific data retrieval needs.
