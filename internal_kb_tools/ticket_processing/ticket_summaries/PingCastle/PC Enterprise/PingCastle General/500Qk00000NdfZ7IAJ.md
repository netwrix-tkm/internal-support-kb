## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with setting up Claims and Role Configurations in PingCastle Enterprise. Users signing in via SSO (Microsoft Entra ID) were unable to see any domains, dashboards, or entities, despite being assigned the appropriate roles. Additionally, there were concerns regarding incorrect documentation and visibility issues with the Scheduler.

## Environment Details
- Authentication method used: OpenID with Entra (AzureAD)
- Configuration involved claims of type `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role` with the value "Operator".

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the Claims and Role Configuration for the test user.
2. Tested visibility for the test user after assigning the Entra role.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue with configurations at the "root" level entities.
4. Investigated the Scheduler to confirm if all tasks were displayed correctly.
5. Modified the command line option in the Task Scheduler from `--server domain.local` to `--server *` to check if it resolved the display issue.
6. Reviewed documentation for discrepancies regarding user claims visibility.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a product defect related to the handling of claims when using OpenID authentication. The claims were not propagating correctly into the PingCastle session, preventing users from accessing the expected resources.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by releasing a fixed version of PingCastle (3.3.0.11) that addressed the claims propagation issue. The updated version ensured that users could see their assigned claims and access the necessary domains and dashboards.

## Notes
- Users should ensure that role names do not overlap with internal names to avoid conflicts.
- The Scheduler may require specific configurations to display tasks correctly, particularly when using wildcards.
- Documentation regarding user claims visibility should be updated to reflect accurate information and provide easier access to debugging claims.
- Future users experiencing similar issues should verify their authentication method and ensure they are using the latest version of PingCastle.
