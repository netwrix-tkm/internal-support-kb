## Ticket Metadata

- **Case Number:** 428970
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** St. Elizabeth Healthcare
- **Contact Name:** Jonathan Johnson
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that despite multiple runs of PingCastle and adjustments made, 8 user accounts still displayed unconstrained delegation. The same changes had been applied to these accounts as to others, yet they remained on the unconstrained delegation list without clear reasons.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Enterprise
- **Issue Type:** Data validation / interpretation
- **Ticket Type:** Unexpected Behavior

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the accounts showing unconstrained delegation.
2. Verified if any delegation settings were applied to the problematic accounts.
3. Suggested the customer remove or restrict any delegation settings found.
4. Awaited feedback from the customer after they tested the provided recommendations.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not explicitly identified; however, it was suggested that the accounts may have had delegation settings that were not properly configured or recognized by the PingCastle tool.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to:
- Review each of the 8 accounts individually.
- Verify if any delegation settings were applied.
- Remove or restrict any unnecessary delegation settings as appropriate.

The customer confirmed understanding and requested to close the case, indicating they would reach out if further assistance was needed.

## Notes
- It is important for future cases to ensure that all delegation settings are thoroughly reviewed, as some configurations may not be immediately apparent.
- Customers should be encouraged to document any changes made to account settings for easier troubleshooting in the future.
