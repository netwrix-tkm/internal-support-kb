- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported a need to create multiple exclusions for a rule in PingCastle due to numerous false positives. They inquired whether it was possible to use the API to create these exceptions in bulk instead of individually.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Enterprise

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Acknowledged the ticket and confirmed receipt of the customer's request.
2. Provided the customer with the API URL for PingCastle to access the necessary documentation and endpoints.
3. Followed up with the customer to check if they had any further questions or needed assistance with the implementation.
4. Confirmed with the customer that they were able to access the API and were attempting to implement the solution.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need to manage a large number of false positives efficiently. The existing process required manual handling of each exception, which was time-consuming and inefficient.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the API URL for PingCastle, which allowed them to access the API documentation and create exceptions in bulk. The specific URL shared was `<pingcastle url>/swagger`, enabling the customer to utilize the API effectively for their needs.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the API documentation available for PingCastle, as it can significantly streamline processes involving bulk operations.
- Encourage customers to reach out if they encounter any issues while implementing API solutions, as timely follow-ups can help ensure successful resolution.
