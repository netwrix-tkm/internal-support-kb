## Problem Description
The customer, Würth IT GmbH, requested assistance in creating a KPI report for a single domain as per their CEO's requirement. They expressed difficulty in finding an option to generate such a report without excessive technical data, leading to a reliance on screenshots and manual work.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps

2. Confirmed that there was no built-in option to create a KPI report for a single domain.
3. Explored potential workarounds or alternative reporting methods.
4. Engaged with the community to assess if similar requests had been made or resolved.

## Root Cause
The inability to generate a KPI report for a single domain was due to the current limitations of the PingCastle reporting features, which did not support this specific request.

## Solution
A feature request was submitted to the Netwrix community to add the capability to create custom KPI reports for individual domains. The request can be tracked at the following link: [Feature Request](https://community.netwrix.com/t/create-a-kpi-report-of-one-domain/14164). 

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that the current version of PingCastle does not support the creation of KPI reports for single domains.
- It is advisable to monitor the community for updates regarding the implementation of this feature in future releases.
- Until the feature is available, users may need to continue using manual methods or screenshots for reporting purposes.
