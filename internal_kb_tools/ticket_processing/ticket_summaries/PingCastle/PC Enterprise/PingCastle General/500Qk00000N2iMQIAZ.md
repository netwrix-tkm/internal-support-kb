- **Account/Company:** WÃ¼rth IT GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Corvin Schmid
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while running the PingCastle health check for their domain, specifically encountering exceptions related to the rules `HeatlcheckRuleTrustFileDeployedOutOfDomain` and `HeatlcheckRulePrivilegedDelegationFileDeployed`. The error message indicated an "Object reference not set to an instance of an object."

## Environment Details
- **Domain:** wgs.wuerth.com
- **Objects Count:** Approximately 270,252 objects in the domain.
- **PingCastle Version:** 3.3.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer initiated the PingCastle health check and retrieved settings via API successfully.
2. The analysis began, gathering various data types including user, computer, trust, and delegation data.
3. The error occurred during the computation of risks, specifically when executing the health check rules.
4. The customer was advised to provide additional context and logs for further analysis.
5. The customer reported that the error occurred only once and could not be reproduced.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a null reference exception occurring within the PingCastle health check rules. This typically indicates that the code attempted to access an object that was not instantiated, possibly due to missing or incomplete data during the analysis phase.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by acknowledging that it was a transient error that occurred only once during the execution of the health check. The customer was advised to monitor the situation and report any recurrence. Since the error could not be reproduced, the ticket was closed without further action.

## Notes
- The error message indicated that the customer should contact PingCastle support for further assistance, which was noted in the logs.
- It is important to gather detailed logs and context if similar issues arise in the future, as this can significantly aid in troubleshooting.
- Customers should be informed that transient errors may occur and may not always require immediate resolution unless they can be consistently reproduced.
