## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JdeU6IAJ
- **Case Number:** 430170
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Euroclear SA/NV
- **Contact Name:** Thomas Bozzini
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the implementation and authentication process of PingCastle. Specifically, they encountered a generic error message when attempting to create a new user during the first login into the enterprise version.

## Environment Details
- **PingCastle Version:** 3.3
- **Build Number:** 3.3.0.3
- **Deployment:** PingCastle Basic installed on satellite servers across multiple domains, with a centralized PingCastle Enterprise server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the installation guide for PingCastle to clarify the implementation and authentication process.
2. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to investigate the login issue further.
3. Analyzed the error message received during user creation.
4. Identified that the user creation process was failing due to a missing email address.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a bug in the application that required an email address during the user creation process. The absence of this mandatory field resulted in a generic error message.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to complete the user registration process by providing an email address. Additionally, the customer was instructed on how to import previously generated reports into the enterprise server and was informed about the necessity of enforcing Windows Authentication after Active Directory groups are created.

## Notes
- A bug has been logged for the email requirement issue (ADO Bug ID: 370361).
- Ensure that users are aware of the mandatory fields during the user creation process to avoid similar issues in the future.
