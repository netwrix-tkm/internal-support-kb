## Problem Description
The client reported issues with the forest domain setup in their environment.

Only one child domain was connected to the parent, while the other domains lacked a parent domain.

2. The issue persisted despite the above steps.
3. The case was escalated to a senior technician (Vincent) for further investigation.
4. The client was advised to upgrade to the latest version of PingCastle to see if it resolved the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an outdated version of PingCastle, which was not compatible with the current domain configurations.

## Notes
- It is important for clients to keep their software up to date to avoid compatibility issues with domain configurations.
- If issues persist after an upgrade, clients should be encouraged to open a new support ticket for further assistance.
