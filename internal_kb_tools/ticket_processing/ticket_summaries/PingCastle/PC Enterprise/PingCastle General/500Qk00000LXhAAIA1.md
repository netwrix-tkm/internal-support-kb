## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LXhAAIA1
- **Case Number:** 434825
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WÃ¼rth IT GmbH
- **Contact Name:** Corvin Schmid
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Enterprise
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after replacing a trial license for PingCastle Enterprise on the server, the client did not automatically retrieve the new license via API call. Instead, it continued to display "Free Edition" and produced an error message indicating that the program was unsupported due to an expired license in the configuration file.

## Environment Details
- **Software Version:** PingCastle 3.3.0
- **License Type:** Trial license for testing purposes

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the license was successfully replaced on the server.
2. Attempted to retrieve settings via API, which confirmed that a new license was retrieved.
3. Observed that the client still displayed "Free Edition" despite the successful API call.
4. Noted that if an expired license was present in the `PingCastle.exe.config` file, an error message was generated: "The program is unsupported since: 2025-02-06 00:00:00Z".
5. Discussed potential application bug with team members.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a bug within the application. The program did not check for a new license via the API before validating the license in the configuration file. As a result, if an expired license was present, it would prevent the application from functioning correctly, even if a valid license was retrieved from the API.

## Solution
The resolution involved planning a fix to be included in the upcoming PingCastle version 3.4, which was scheduled for release in May 2025. This fix would ensure that the application checks for a new license via the API before validating the local configuration file.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that having an expired license in the `PingCastle.exe.config` file will lead to unsupported program errors.
- It is recommended to remove any expired licenses from the configuration file to avoid confusion until the fix is applied in version 3.4.
- Customers can raise new tickets for any concerns after the release of the new version.
