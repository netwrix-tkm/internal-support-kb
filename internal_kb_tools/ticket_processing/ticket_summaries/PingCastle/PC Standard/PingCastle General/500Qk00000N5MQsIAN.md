## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N5MQsIAN
- **Case Number:** 439246
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** National Australia Bank (NAB)
- **Contact Name:** Lachlan Clarke
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when running a PingCastle scan against their development domain, the process consistently got stuck at the "Gathering GPO data" step. This issue persisted even after leaving the scan running overnight and was observed in both versions 3.2.0.1 and 3.3.0.1.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a development environment.
- The scans were previously successful, with the last successful scan noted on March 1st.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Enabled logging for each scan to capture detailed trace logs.
2. Reviewed trace logs for errors and timeouts.
3. Suggested checking firewall settings and network stability.
4. Inquired about recent changes to the environment that could affect the scan.
5. Provided a list of necessary ports for PingCastle functionality:
   - LDAP (tcp/389)
   - ADWS (tcp/9389)
   - SMB (tcp/445)
   - DNS (tcp/53)
   - RPC (tcp/135)

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration related to DFS paths that were not disabled correctly. This caused the scan to hang while checking certain MSI files, leading to timeouts and repeated attempts to reconnect.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by correctly disabling the problematic DFS paths. After making this adjustment, the PingCastle scan was able to complete successfully without getting stuck at the "Gathering GPO data" step.

## Notes
- Ensure that DFS paths are properly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify that all necessary ports are open and that network stability is maintained to facilitate smooth operation of PingCastle scans.
