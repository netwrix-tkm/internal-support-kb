## Problem Description
The customer reported that their auditor's license key, which is valid until January 2025, was not functioning with the latest software version 3.1.0.01. The software indicated that it was unsupported since January 27, 2023. However, the same license key worked correctly with version 3.2.0.1.

2. Confirmed that the license key was incorrect.
3. Involved the Account Owner (AO) to generate a new license key.
4. Tested the new license key with the software.

## Root Cause

## Notes
- Ensure that customers verify their license keys before troubleshooting software issues.
- Always confirm the compatibility of the license key with the specific software version being used.
