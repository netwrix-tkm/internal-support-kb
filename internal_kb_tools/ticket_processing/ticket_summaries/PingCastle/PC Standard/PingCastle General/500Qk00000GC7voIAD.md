## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GC7voIAD
- **Case Number:** 421962
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Fortress SRM
- **Contact Name:** Jordan Schwieso
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after running an Active Directory (AD) Health scan multiple times, the "Hardened Paths" warning continues to appear. They have a Group Policy Object (GPO) implemented at the top of the domain to configure hardened paths, yet the PingCastle tool indicates that no GPOs are created.

## Environment Details
- Single forest/domain setup.
- GPO linked to the root of the domain.
- Potential issues with the connection to the DOMAINSYSVOL share.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the existence of a GPO at the root of the domain.
2. Suggested the customer check the values for their hardened UNC paths due to unexpected quotes.
3. Advised the customer to run the health check using version 3.3 instead of 3.2.0.1.
4. Requested the customer to send a trace log for further investigation if issues persisted.
5. Followed up on the customer's progress and any errors encountered during the process.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the formatting of the hardened UNC paths in the GPO. Specifically, the presence of unexpected quotes around the path values was causing the PingCastle tool to misinterpret the configuration.

## Solution
The resolution involved removing the quotes from the values for the hardened UNC paths in the GPO. Once the customer made these adjustments, the issue was resolved, and the AD Health scan no longer flagged the "Hardened Paths" warning.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to GPO settings are carefully validated to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to check for formatting issues, such as unexpected quotes, when configuring UNC paths in GPOs.
- Always recommend using the latest version of the software for compatibility and improved functionality.
