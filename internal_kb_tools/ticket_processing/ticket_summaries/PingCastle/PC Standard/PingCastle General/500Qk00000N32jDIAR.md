## Problem Description
The customer reported that they could not access the Netwrix customer portal and inquired about managing user access to licenses associated with their profile. They specifically wanted to know if it was possible to manage other users' access and how to associate licenses with different profiles in the customer portal.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using PingCastle version 3.3.
- The issue was related to user access management within the Netwrix customer portal.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer was unable to see the option to access the Netwrix customer portal.
2. Explained the current limitations of the customer portal, specifically that users are associated with accounts based on their email domain.
3. Discussed the implications of this association, where any employee with the same domain could access all licenses under that domain.
4. Offered to escalate the request for enhanced user management capabilities to the development team.
5. Collected a list of users that the customer wanted to retain access to the portal.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the design of the Netwrix customer portal, which does not currently allow organizations to manage user access independently. Users are automatically granted access based on their email domain, leading to concerns about unauthorized access to licenses.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Updating the customer portal access to ensure that only the specified users (provided by the customer) retained access to the licenses associated with their account.
- Confirming that the access changes were implemented and that the customer was satisfied with the resolution.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that the current design of the Netwrix customer portal does not allow for granular user access management.
- Future enhancements to the portal may address these concerns, and feedback should be collected for consideration in redesign efforts.
- Customers should be advised to provide a list of users who should retain access if they have concerns about unauthorized access based on email domain associations.
