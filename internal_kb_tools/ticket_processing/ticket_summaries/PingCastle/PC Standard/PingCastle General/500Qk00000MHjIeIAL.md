- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Barratt Developments Plc
- **Contact Name:** Atif Rashid
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** General
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.1.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported a security risk identified by PingCastle indicating that "Hardened Paths have been modified to lower the security level." They requested assistance in understanding and remediating this risk within their Active Directory (AD).

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the configuration of Hardened UNC Paths in Group Policy affecting SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to discuss the identified risk.
2. Reviewed the findings related to Hardened UNC Paths and the Protected Users group.
3. Provided detailed mitigation steps for the Hardened UNC Paths policy:
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Network > Network Provider > Hardened UNC Paths`.
   - Apply the following settings:
     - `SYSVOL  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1`
     - `NETLOGON  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1`
   - Execute `gpupdate /force` and verify access controls.
4. Suggested adding privileged accounts to the Protected Users group to enhance security.

## Root Cause
The Hardened UNC Paths policy was altered, which reduced the security protections for SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation of Group Policy settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correctly enforcing the Hardened UNC Paths policy through Group Policy Management as outlined above.
- Adding necessary privileged accounts to the Protected Users group to strengthen authentication policies.

## Notes
- It is crucial to regularly review Group Policy settings to ensure that security configurations remain intact.
- Future changes to Group Policy should be documented and assessed for their impact on security.
- Ensure that all privileged accounts are included in the Protected Users group to mitigate authentication-based attacks.
