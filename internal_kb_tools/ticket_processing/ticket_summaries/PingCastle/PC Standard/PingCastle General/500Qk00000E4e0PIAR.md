## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E4e0PIAR
- **Case Number:** 417219
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** METSYS
- **Contact Name:** Thierry Plantive
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they are using Windows LAPS in the cloud, but PingCastle is indicating that LAPS needs to be installed. The customer is seeking a way to ignore this check in order to remove it from the PingCastle report.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the PingCastle report to confirm the presence of the LAPS installation check.
2. Consulted with team members for potential solutions to exclude the LAPS check from the report.
3. Explored options within PingCastle to omit specific checks from the report.
4. Identified that there was no direct option available in PingCastle to ignore the LAPS check.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation within PingCastle, which does not provide a built-in feature to exclude the LAPS check from the report when it is detected.

## Solution
The resolution involved a workaround:
- Generate the report using the command:
  ```bash
  --level Full
  ```
  This command ensures that the XML data contains all relevant information.
- Edit the generated XML file to remove the LAPS check.
- Regenerate the report using the modified XML file with the command:
  ```bash
  --regen-report <file.xml>
  ```

## Notes
- This workaround is necessary until a feature is implemented in PingCastle to allow users to ignore specific checks directly.
- Customers should be informed that manual editing of the XML file is required and that they should proceed with caution to avoid unintentional data loss.
