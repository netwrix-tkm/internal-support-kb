## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NeL6wIAF
- **Case Number:** 440859
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** USU Software AG
- **Contact Name:** Dominik Padych
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer, Dominik Padych, reported an issue with using PingCastle to scan Azure AD (Entra ID). Despite assigning the necessary permissions (`Directory.Read.All` and `Security.Read.All`) to the scanning account, no information was returned during the scan. The customer sought clarification on whether additional permissions were required and requested documentation on setting up Azure AD scanning with PingCastle.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Azure AD (Entra ID)
- **Permissions Assigned:** 
  - `Directory.Read.All`
  - `Security.Read.All`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the permissions assigned to the scanning account.
2. Reviewed the current documentation and community forums for PingCastle regarding Azure AD scanning.
3. Advised the customer to wait for an upcoming patch that would address the issue.
4. Suggested running an interactive scan as a temporary workaround until the migration to the Graph API was completed.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the use of deprecated APIs (MSOnline API and AzureAD APIs) in PingCastle. The permissions assigned were insufficient due to the ongoing migration to the Graph API, which was not yet fully implemented in the current version of PingCastle.

## Solution
The resolution involved informing the customer that the required feature for scanning Azure AD would be rolled out in an upcoming release. The customer was advised to monitor the community link for updates on PingCastle releases and to run interactive scans in the meantime.

## Notes
- The customer was encouraged to avoid granting excessive permissions until the necessary ones were clearly defined in the upcoming release.
- It was recommended to check the following community link for updates regarding PingCastle releases: [PingCastle Community Announcements](https://community.netwrix.com/c/products/pingcastle/announcements/126).
- Future users should be aware that permissions may change with updates, and it is advisable to consult the official documentation post-release for the most accurate information.
