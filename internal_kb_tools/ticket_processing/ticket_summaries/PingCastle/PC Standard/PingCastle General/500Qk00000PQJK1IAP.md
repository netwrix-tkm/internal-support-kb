- **Contact Name:** Thomas Fargeix
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard

- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer, Thomas Fargeix, reported that only he had access to the PingCastle Standard product page, which included the ability to download the latest version and generate temporary 48-hour licenses. He requested access for additional team members to the "Download 48H Assessment License" functionality.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Standard
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the licensing structure of PingCastle Standard.
2. Checked user account statuses for team members attempting to access the product.
3. Confirmed that only the ticket owner had an active Netwrix account on the portal.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the fact that the team members attempting to access the PingCastle license did not have Netwrix accounts on the portal, which restricted their access to the necessary functionalities.

## Solution
The resolution involved creating and approving Netwrix accounts for the additional team members. Once the corresponding user accounts were set up and approved by the account manager, the access issue was resolved, allowing the team members to utilize the "Download 48H Assessment License" feature.

## Notes
- Ensure that all users who require access to PingCastle functionalities have active Netwrix accounts.
- It is advisable to communicate the account creation process to users in advance to prevent similar access issues in the future.
