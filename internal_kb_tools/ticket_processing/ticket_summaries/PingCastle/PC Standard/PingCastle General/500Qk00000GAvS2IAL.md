## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GAvS2IAL
- **Case Number:** 421899
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** METSYS
- **Contact Name:** Thierry Plantive
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when launching the PingCastle v3.3 application on a Domain Controller (DC), the application crashes with an error related to loading the `System.Net.Http` assembly.

## Environment Details
- **Application Version:** PingCastle v3.3
- **Operating Environment:** Domain Controller (DC)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run the application with the `--log` switch to gather more detailed error information.
2. The error message indicated a `FileNotFoundException` for the `System.Net.Http` assembly, version 4.2.0.0.
3. The support team reviewed the error logs and confirmed the missing assembly issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a .NET Framework error, specifically due to the absence of the required `System.Net.Http` assembly on the system where PingCastle was being executed.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the customer was advised to install the appropriate version of the .NET Framework that includes the `System.Net.Http` assembly. It was also noted that PingCastle operates more effectively when run from a Server or Workstation rather than a Domain Controller, as it cannot confirm certain findings locally.

## Notes
- Ensure that the .NET Framework is properly installed and updated on the system where PingCastle is being run.
- For optimal performance and accurate results, avoid running PingCastle directly on a Domain Controller.
