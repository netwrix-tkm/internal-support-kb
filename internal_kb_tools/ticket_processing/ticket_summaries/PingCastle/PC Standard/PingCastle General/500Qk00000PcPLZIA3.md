## Problem Description
The customer, Dimitrios Kasderidis, inquired about submitting a PowerShell script designed to simplify the output of a report on "Stale Objects -> Obsolete OS (Windows 10 or Windows 11)." The script aims to enhance usability for administrators running it on a Domain Controller, where restrictions can hinder the evaluation of output files.

## Environment Details
- The script is intended for use on a Domain Controller.
- The output file generated by the main menu is typically opened in Excel, which can be problematic due to administrative restrictions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's request regarding the submission of the PowerShell script.
2. Confirmed the purpose of the script and its intended use case.
3. Advised the customer on the appropriate platform for submitting ideas and scripts.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity on how users could share helpful scripts within the community, particularly for scripts that enhance usability in restricted environments.

## Solution
The customer was advised to post their idea on the Netwrix community forum to share the PowerShell script with other users. A specific link to the community idea submission page was provided: [Netwrix Community Ideas](https://community.netwrix.com/c/products/pingcastle/ideas/129).

## Notes
- Future users looking to submit scripts or ideas should be directed to the community forum for proper submission.
- It is important to ensure that any scripts shared comply with organizational policies regarding security and data handling, especially when used in sensitive environments like Domain Controllers.
