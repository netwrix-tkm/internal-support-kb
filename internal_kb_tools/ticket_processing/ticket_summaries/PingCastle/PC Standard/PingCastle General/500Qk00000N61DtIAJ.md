- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer, Julien Maltaverne from Thales Group, reported an issue with adding a custom rule on the `DoListObject` in PingCastle to increase the ORADAD level. The customer was blocked at ORADAD level 2, despite the global domain risk level being 0.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using the Auditor version of PingCastle, which does not support custom rules or modifications to maturity levels.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's request to add a custom rule on `DoListObject`.
2. Informed the customer that custom rules can only be implemented in the Pro or Enterprise versions of PingCastle.
3. Provided instructions on how to access the Enterprise UI and configure custom rules if they had the appropriate version.
4. Suggested using the command line to download rules and modify the `PingCastle.exe.config` file.
5. Clarified the meaning of "Web UI" to the customer.
6. Confirmed the customer's PingCastle version as Auditor, which does not support the requested functionality.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer's use of the Auditor version of PingCastle, which does not allow for the creation or modification of custom rules. Custom rules and maturity level adjustments are only available in the Pro and Enterprise versions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the customer could not implement the requested changes due to the limitations of the Auditor version. The customer was advised to consider upgrading to the Pro version to access the desired features. The account manager was contacted to discuss potential upgrades.

## Notes
- The customer confirmed their use of the Auditor version and acknowledged the limitations it imposed.
- It is important to inform customers about the version limitations early in the troubleshooting process to manage expectations.
- Future inquiries regarding custom rules should first confirm the customer's version of PingCastle to avoid unnecessary troubleshooting steps.
