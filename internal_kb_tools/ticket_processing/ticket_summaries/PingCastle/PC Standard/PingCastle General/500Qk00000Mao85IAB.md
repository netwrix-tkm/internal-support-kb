The customer reported that they were unable to see their Netwrix PingCastle Standard license in the "My Products" section of the Netwrix Customer Portal.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Customer Portal
- **Product Version:** 3.1.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Confirmed that the PingCastle Standard license was not visible.
4. Support team verified account details and confirmed the license was active.
5. Customer rechecked the "My Products" section after support intervention.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by a portal synchronization delay or a temporary display issue, which prevented the license from being displayed initially.

## Solution
After verifying the account details and confirming the license was active, the customer was advised to recheck the "My Products" section. Upon doing so, the PingCastle Standard license became visible. No further action was required as the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- If the problem recurs, the customer should try logging out and back in, or clearing their browser cache.
- If the license disappears again, further investigation into potential account synchronization issues may be necessary.
