6. The support team confirmed that the web team was aware of the issue and was working on a resolution.
7. After further internal discussions, the support team confirmed that the issue was resolved and instructed the customer to try downloading again.

## Root Cause
The download errors were caused by issues on the website due to custom configurations made for PingCastle Standard, which interfered with the functionality of new files and file types.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by the web team, who fixed the underlying problems on the website. The customer was then able to successfully download the files. Additionally, the customer was informed that they would need to apply the license manually after downloading the product, as licenses were not currently distributed via the customer portal.

## Notes
- The customer should apply the license in the `pingcastle.exe.config` file after downloading the product.
- Ensure that customers are aware that licenses may not be available for download directly from the portal and may need to be provided separately by support.
- Future cases involving download errors should consider checking for website configuration issues and file compatibility as potential root causes.
