## Problem Description
The customer, SEC Consult, reported that after purchasing a new PingCastle license through Netwrix, they were unable to see the license in their Netwrix products portal, preventing them from downloading the software.

## Environment Details
- **Distributor:** Netsense
- **Purchase Order:** 3700355359

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to log into the Netwrix products portal using the email associated with the purchase.
2. The support engineer checked the account association in Salesforce to verify if the customerâ€™s account was linked to the company.
3. After confirming the account was not associated, the support engineer added the account to the company in Salesforce.
4. The customer was asked to log in again to check if the products were now visible.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer's account not being associated with the company in Salesforce, which resulted in the absence of any products in their Netwrix products page.

## Solution
Once the account was correctly associated with the company in Salesforce, the customer was able to log in to the Netwrix products portal and successfully see and download the PingCastle software.

## Notes
- Ensure that customer accounts are properly associated with their respective companies in Salesforce to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the email used for the purchase when troubleshooting access to products in the portal.
