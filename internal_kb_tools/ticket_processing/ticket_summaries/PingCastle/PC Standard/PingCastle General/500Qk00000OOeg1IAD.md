## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OOeg1IAD
- **Case Number:** 443015
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AXAXL
- **Contact Name:** Maciej Mrowiec
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after running PingCastle in the Azure AD environment, the domain risk level displayed a score of 0/100. This score seemed overly optimistic, and the customer was uncertain if PingCastle was scanning their production tenants correctly. Only one informative rule was highlighted for review.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Azure AD
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician requested the customer to enable logging in the PingCastle configuration file.
2. Instructions were provided to locate and modify the `web.config` file to enable logging.
3. The customer was instructed to re-run PingCastle and check the logs for further insights.

## Root Cause
The issue could not be resolved until the Azure AD module was upgraded to the PowerShell Graph module. The existing module was not compatible with the required functionalities for accurate scanning.

## Solution
The customer confirmed internally that the issue would remain unresolved until the Azure AD module was upgraded. They requested to close the ticket as there was no workaround available at that time.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Azure AD module is upgraded to the PowerShell Graph module for future scans to function correctly.
- When troubleshooting similar issues, verify the version of the Azure AD module being used and its compatibility with PingCastle features.
