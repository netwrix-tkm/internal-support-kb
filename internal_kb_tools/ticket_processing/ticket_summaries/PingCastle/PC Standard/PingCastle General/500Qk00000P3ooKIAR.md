## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P3ooKIAR
- **Case Number:** 444779
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AXAXL
- **Contact Name:** Maciej Mrowiec
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that PingCastle triggered the rule 'Presence of unknown account in delegation' on April 28th. Upon review, they determined that this alert was a false positive, as the delegated account originated from a trusted domain and was resolving correctly. The customer was unsure why PingCastle identified the account as foreign, especially since there were no recent changes or issues with the trust relationship between the domains.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** On-premises deployment of PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the alert triggered by PingCastle.
2. Confirmed that the delegated account was from a trusted domain and resolving properly.
3. Checked the trust relationship between the two domains to ensure there were no issues.
4. Investigated for any recent changes that could have affected the delegation.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an intermittent DNS problem on the user's end, which caused PingCastle to misinterpret the status of the delegated account.

## Solution
The resolution involved the customer working with their local IT team to address the intermittent DNS issues. Once resolved, PingCastle no longer flagged the account as foreign.

## Notes
- It is important for users to ensure that DNS configurations are stable and correctly set up, as intermittent DNS issues can lead to false positives in security tools like PingCastle.
- Regular checks on trust relationships between domains can help prevent similar misunderstandings in the future.
