## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hzjg0IAB
- **Case Number:** 426342
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CAB IT-Systemhaus GmbH
- **Contact Name:** F Schillinger
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported two issues: 
1. Inability to download the current version of PingCastle (version 3.3), receiving an error message instructing them to contact support.
2. Difficulty scanning Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), with uncertainty if the issue persisted in the newer version.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using PingCastle version 3.2.0.1.
- The error encountered during the download process was a 404 error when attempting to access the download link.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested a screenshot of the error message encountered during the download attempt.
2. Suggested the customer access the license management page to verify their license status and download the product: [PingCastle License Management](https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense).
3. The customer confirmed that their license was reported as invalid.
4. The support engineer contacted the licensing team to verify and provide a new license.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a licensing problem. The customer's existing license was invalid, preventing them from downloading the latest version of PingCastle and potentially affecting the Azure AD scanning functionality.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Providing the customer with a new, valid license from the licensing team.
2. Confirming that the Azure AD scan functionality was operational after the license was updated. The customer was informed that Azure AD has a smaller rule set compared to Active Directory, which was expected behavior.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the validity of the customer's license before troubleshooting download issues.
- When addressing Azure AD scanning issues, clarify that the rule set is smaller than that of Active Directory, which may lead to different results in scans.
- Ensure to follow up with customers after resolving issues to confirm that they are satisfied and that no further assistance is needed.
