- **Case Number:** 432837
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gutenberg Rechenzentrum GmbH & Co.
- **Contact Name:** Dirk Maass
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating PingCastle from version 3.2.0.1 to 3.3.0.1, the license was no longer recognized. The customer expressed concern that this issue might be related to the update or the product's acquisition by Netwrix.

## Environment Details
- The customer did not have an active license for PingCastle due to a recent name change of their business, which affected the licensing records.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer did not have an active license for PingCastle.
2. Investigated the impact of the business name change on the licensing system.
3. Issued a temporary 30-day license on March 20, 2025, to allow continued use of the software while resolving the licensing issue.
4. Communicated with sales and legal teams to address the licensing assignment agreement.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer's business undergoing a name change, which resulted in the license not being applied correctly under either the old or new company name. This discrepancy led to the license being unrecognized after the software update.

## Solution
- A temporary 30-day license was issued to the customer on March 20, 2025, to ensure continued access to PingCastle.
- Following further investigation, a full replacement license was provided, valid until the end of the current service contract on June 11, 2025. This license was confirmed to work correctly by the customer.

## Notes
- Future cases involving business name changes should ensure that licensing records are updated promptly to avoid similar issues.
- It is important to maintain clear communication with sales and legal teams when dealing with licensing issues, especially during transitions like company name changes.
