## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000F5YRrIAN
- **Case Number:** 419513
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KPMG Finland
- **Contact Name:** Tommi Heinisaari
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported difficulty in finding documentation on how to restrict PingCastle scans from including "Domain Trusts." They expressed concern that including these trusts could lead to scanning resources that are outside the intended scope.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing documentation for PingCastle regarding scan configurations.
2. Clarified the functionality of the health check command in relation to domain trusts.
3. Explained the implications of including domain trusts in the scan.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of how PingCastle handles domain trusts during scans. The customer was not aware that the health check command is designed to automatically include domains with trusts, and there is no need to exclude them manually.

## Solution
The resolution involved explaining to the customer that when running the health check command, it is not necessary to exclude domains with trusts. The command is intended to explore the forests and domain trusts automatically, ensuring that all relevant domains are included in the scan without manual exclusions.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that the health check command is comprehensive and includes all domains with established trusts by default.
- Future inquiries regarding scan configurations should emphasize the automatic handling of domain trusts to prevent similar confusion.
