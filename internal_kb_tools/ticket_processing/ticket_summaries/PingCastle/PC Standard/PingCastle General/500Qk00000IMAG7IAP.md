- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG
- **Contact Name:** Markus KÃ¶nig

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with downloading version 3.3.0.1 of PingCastle, receiving an error message stating, "Something went wrong. Please open a ticket."

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a Windows Server 2016 environment without internet connectivity.
- The account running the scheduled task had issues with the certificate store.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message received during the download attempt.
2. Investigated the certificate store for the account running the scheduled task.
3. Identified a potential chaining issue with the trusted root certification authority.
4. Suggested using `certutil` to sync the certificate store with Windows Update.
5. Provided links for troubleshooting app package signature errors and managing trusted root certificates.
6. Checked the Windows Event Viewer for CAPI2 logs to identify specific certificate failures.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as issues with the certificate store for the account running the scheduled task, specifically a chaining issue related to the trusted root certification authority. The error code 0x800B010A indicated that the certificate could not be verified due to missing or untrusted root certificates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Updating the certificate store using `certutil -syncWithWU` to ensure the necessary root certificates were present.
- The customer was advised to apply their license key into the `pingcastle.exe.config` file after downloading the correct version.

## Notes
- Ensure that the server running PingCastle has access to the necessary root certificates, especially in environments without internet connectivity.
- For future reference, if similar issues arise, check the digital signature of the executable and ensure that the certificate chain is complete and trusted.
- If the application continues to report as a free version after applying the license, verify that the license key is correctly entered and that the correct version of the software is being used.
