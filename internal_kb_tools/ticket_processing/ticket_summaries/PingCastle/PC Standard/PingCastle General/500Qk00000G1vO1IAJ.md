## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G1vO1IAJ
- **Case Number:** 421626
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Accenture Services s.r.o.
- **Contact Name:** Nimantha Galhenage
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their Domain Controllers (DC) were configured to require signing for LDAP, but the PingCastle report failed to recognize this configuration across all DCs. The Group Policy Object (GPO) was applied correctly, and the appropriate registry key was present on each domain controller.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the GPO was applied correctly to all Domain Controllers.
2. Checked the registry key settings on each DC to ensure the signing configuration was set.
3. Assisted the customer in running the PingCastle health check with the `--log` option to generate a trace file.
4. Analyzed the trace file to determine how PingCastle was connecting to LDAP.
5. Tested reconfiguring one Domain Controller to see if the PingCastle report would reflect the correct signing status.

## Root Cause
An older GPO was found to be overriding the signing configuration, setting the value to "None," which caused PingCastle to report that signing for LDAP was not required.

## Solution
After identifying the conflicting GPO, the customer reconfigured one Domain Controller to enforce the signing requirement. Following this change, the PingCastle report accurately reflected the status of the signing requirement, confirming that the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that no older GPOs are conflicting with the desired signing configurations on Domain Controllers.
- Regularly review GPO settings to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
- When troubleshooting similar issues, always check for conflicting policies that may override intended configurations.
