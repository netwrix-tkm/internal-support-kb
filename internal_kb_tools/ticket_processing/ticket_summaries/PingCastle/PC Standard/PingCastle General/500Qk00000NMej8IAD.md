- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The code signing certificate for the executables `pingcastle.exe` (version 3.3.0.1) and `pingcastleautoupdater.exe` expired on 10/22/2024. A client refused to allow the execution of the tool on their systems due to this expiration.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the executables mentioned above, which were being used in a client environment that required valid code signing certificates for security compliance.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the code signing certificate for `pingcastle.exe` and confirmed it was expired.
2. Informed the client that they needed to download version 3.3.0.8 from the portal, where the code signing certificate was valid.
3. Communicated with the client regarding the implications of using the autoupdater, which could downgrade the executables back to the expired version.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the expiration of the code signing certificate for the executables, which was not renewed before the expiration date.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the client to download and install version 3.3.0.8 of the software from the Netwrix portal, which contained a valid code signing certificate. This allowed the client to execute the tool without security concerns.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the expiration dates of code signing certificates and renew them in a timely manner to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Clients should be informed about the potential downgrading effect of using the autoupdater, especially if it pulls an older version with an expired certificate.
