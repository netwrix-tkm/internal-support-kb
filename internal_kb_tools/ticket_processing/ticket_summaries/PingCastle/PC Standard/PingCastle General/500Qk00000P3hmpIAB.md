## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000P3hmpIAB
- **Case Number:** 444776
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** USU Software AG
- **Contact Name:** Dominik Padych
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3.0.11

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their implementation of PingCastle for Azure AD scans was not yielding relevant information. Specifically, the scan returned a score of 0/100 and no rules were matched, despite using an Azure Admin account with the Auditor Edition license.

## Environment Details
- **PingCastle Version:** 3.3.0.11
- **License Type:** Auditor Edition
- **User Account:** Azure Admin account used for testing

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the version of PingCastle being used (3.3.0.11).
2. Confirmed that the Auditor Edition license was in use.
3. Conducted a manual test run using an Azure Admin account to ensure there were no permission-related issues.
4. Reviewed the attached report to analyze the output of the scan.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the parameters and rules that PingCastle uses for Azure AD scans. It was determined that the rules for Azure AD are not included automatically in PingCastle and must be downloaded separately.

## Solution
The concern was resolved by informing the customer that:
- The rules for Azure AD are not included by default in PingCastle and need to be obtained separately.
- The Auditor Edition license is sufficient for running Azure AD scans, provided the correct rules are in place.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the need to download and configure Azure AD rules separately for PingCastle to function correctly.
- Future users should verify their license type and ensure they have the necessary rules for the specific environment they are scanning.
