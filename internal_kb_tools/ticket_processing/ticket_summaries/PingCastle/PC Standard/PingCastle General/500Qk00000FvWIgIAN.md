## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FvWIgIAN
- **Case Number:** 421365
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Fortress SRM
- **Contact Name:** Jordan Schwieso
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with identifying devices running obsolete Windows editions. While PingCastle flagged five "active" devices with unsupported versions, it did not provide the actual device names. The customer faced two main problems: the AD computer report was corrupting and outputting data in a single line in CSV format, and the provided PowerShell command did not display the "Active" attribute necessary for remediation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Standard
- **Product Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run the PingCastle AD Computer report, which resulted in a corrupt CSV file.
2. Tried using the provided PowerShell command to retrieve device information, but it failed to show the "Active" attribute.
3. Investigated the format of the reports generated by PingCastle.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the format of the reports generated by PingCastle. The reports were tab-delimited rather than comma-delimited, which led to the perception of corruption when opened in Excel.

## Solution
The customer realized that the reports were tab-delimited, which allowed them to successfully open and filter the data in Excel. No further technical intervention was required once this was clarified.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the report format (tab-delimited vs. comma-delimited) to prevent confusion in the future.
- When using PowerShell commands, confirm that all necessary attributes are included in the output to meet user requirements.
