- **Case Number:** 445640
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Microsoft Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Mike DeFlice
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** Active Directory Web Services
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.2.0.1

## Problem Description
The customer reported an exception occurring during a scan for critical and infrastructure objects in Active Directory. The error indicated that a request operation did not receive a reply within the configured timeout.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** PingCastle
- **Collector Code:** PC Standard
- **Error Code:** -2147024662
- **Extended Error Message:** "Calling GetNextRow can potentially return more results."

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the log file for error messages and stack traces.
2. Identified that the operation timeout was set to 1 minute and suggested increasing it.
3. Noted that the Active Directory server might be under load, leading to the timeout.
4. Suggested checking for Active Directory corruption using the corruption scanner or `ntdsutil.exe`.
5. Communicated with the internal network/support team regarding potential issues with AD services or firewall/security software.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the Active Directory services being under load, which prevented timely responses to requests. Additionally, there may have been interference from firewall or security software.

## Solution
The resolution involved checking with the internal network/support team to address the issues with Active Directory services. It was recommended to increase the operation timeout and ensure that the Active Directory server was not overloaded.

## Notes
- If similar timeout issues occur, consider increasing the operation timeout setting.
- Monitor the load on the Active Directory server to prevent future timeouts.
- Regularly check for Active Directory integrity and potential corruption using available tools.
