- **Case Number:** 428110
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Willi-Food
- **Contact Name:** Liav Avraham
- **Product:** PingCastle
- **Component:** PC Standard
- **Feature:** PingCastle General
- **Version:** 3.3

## Problem Description
The customer, Liav Avraham, reported that the PingCastle tool indicated "Check for Native administrator usage - recently used: 0 days ago," despite confirming through the event viewer that the native administrator account had not been used.

## Environment Details
- Domain Controllers (DC) were in use.
- The customer had configured event logs to audit logins.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer ran the PingCastle tool and noted the report indicating no recent usage of the native administrator account.
2. Checked event viewer logs on all DC servers for any activity related to the native administrator account.
3. Confirmed that the event logs were configured to audit logins but found no events for the built-in administrator account (RID -500).
4. Customer was advised to generate a trace log by adding `--log` to the command line when running the tool.
5. Customer provided the trace log for further analysis.
6. Support reviewed the logs and provided a PowerShell query to check the LastLogon property for the administrator account.

## Root Cause
The discrepancy arose from the difference between the `LastLogon` and `LastLogonTimestamp` attributes. The `LastLogon` attribute is not replicated and reflects the most recent logon on the specific DC, while `LastLogonTimestamp` is replicated every 14 days and may not show the most current activity.

## Solution
The support team clarified that the PingCastle tool uses the `LastLogon` attribute to report the most accurate data. They provided the following PowerShell query to check the LastLogon property for the administrator account:

```powershell
Get-ADDomainController -Filter "*" | Foreach {
    $DC = $_.HostName
    Get-ADUser -Filter { ObjectSid -eq "S-1-5-21-1644491937-746137067-682003330-500" } -Properties * -Server $DC | 
    Select SAMAccountName, @{ Name = "LastLogonConverted" ; Expression = { [DateTime]::FromFileTime($_.LastLogon) }}, @{ Name = "DC" ; Expression = {$DC}}
}
```

The support team also recommended checking logon events on the DC with the most recent `LastLogon` attribute value.

## Notes
- Ensure that event logs are configured correctly to capture all relevant logon events.
- The `LastLogon` attribute provides real-time data for logon activity, while `LastLogonTimestamp` may not reflect recent logins due to its replication schedule.
- For future cases, it may be beneficial to educate customers on the differences between these attributes to avoid confusion.
