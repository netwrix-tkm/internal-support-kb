- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported a "Request Header Too Long" 400 error when some users attempted to log in using the single sign-on option through the survey action module on the 8082 website. Users could successfully log in using incognito mode, leading the customer to suspect that the issue was related to users being members of many Active Directory (AD) groups.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 11.6
- **Previous Version:** 11.5
- **Authentication Method:** Single Sign-On (SSO)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message received by users during login attempts.
2. Confirmed that affected users could log in using incognito mode.
3. Investigated potential causes related to user membership in multiple AD groups.
4. Suggested clearing browser cookies and cache.
5. Recommended increasing the `maxHttpHeaderSize` in the Tomcat server configuration.
6. Reviewed webserver and Tomcat logs for error messages.
7. Provided a debug build to gather more information about the issue.
8. Adjusted registry keys for `MaxFieldLength` and `MaxRequestBytes` as per Microsoft guidelines.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to the maximum header size limits set in the server's configuration. Specifically, the number of AD group memberships for certain users resulted in excessively large request headers, exceeding the default limits.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the Windows registry settings to increase the `MaxFieldLength` and `MaxRequestBytes` values. The following changes were made:
```plaintext
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters
- MaxFieldLength: DWORD 65536 (Dec)
- MaxRequestBytes: DWORD 16777216 (Dec)
```
After applying these changes and rebooting the server, affected users were able to access the portal without encountering the "Request Header Too Long" error.

## Notes
- Ensure to consider the security implications of modifying registry settings, as increasing these values can expose the server to certain risks.
- Future cases involving similar errors should first check user group memberships and header size limits in server configurations.
