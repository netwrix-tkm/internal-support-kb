## Problem Description
The customer, Bank of America, requested guidance regarding the involvement of third parties and subcontractors in relation to their services and data handling. They posed several questions about the development and provision of artificial intelligence models, data access, and software customization.

## Environment Details
- The product in scope is hosted on-premises in the customer's environment.
- Netwrix does not host or store customer systems or data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the questions posed by the customer regarding third-party involvement and data handling.
2. Assigned the case to Brandon West for further investigation and legal verification.
3. Communicated with the vendor by sending the inquiries to VendorForms@netwrix.com.

## Root Cause
The inquiry was primarily about understanding the relationship and data handling practices of third parties and subcontractors associated with Bank of America. There was no technical issue; rather, it was a request for clarification on compliance and operational practices.

## Solution
The questions were addressed as follows:
1. Confirmed that the third party does not develop or provide models or artificial intelligence for Bank of America.
2. Clarified that the services are only provided by a US-based Netwrix support team.
3. Stated that the product does not allow third parties to access, process, store, transmit, or transport Bank of America data.
4. Confirmed that no software applications are developed or customized specifically for Bank of America by the third party.
5. Clarified that the relationship does not involve any applications that Bank of America builds, buys, or uses to enable a business process.

## Notes
- Ensure that future inquiries regarding third-party involvement and data handling are documented clearly to facilitate quick responses.
- Maintain awareness that compliance-related questions may require legal verification, which can extend response times.
