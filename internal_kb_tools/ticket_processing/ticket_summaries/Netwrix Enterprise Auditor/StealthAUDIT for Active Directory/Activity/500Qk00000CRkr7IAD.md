## Problem Description
The customer requested a report on recently locked-out user accounts, as they could not find an out-of-the-box solution in the Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job or instant solutions.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The inquiry involved Active Directory (AD) user lockouts.

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Clarified how AD Activity auditing integrates with the Netwrix/Stealth suite.
4. Provided links to relevant documentation for further understanding of AD Activity configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from inaccurate documentation regarding the availability of a lockout report in the Netwrix product suite, specifically in the context of Active Directory auditing.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to the appropriate job within the Active Directory > 6. Activity job group, which includes the lockout report functionality. Additionally, the customer was informed about the deprecated Lockout job and provided with documentation links for better understanding of AD Activity integration.

## Notes
- The previous Lockout job is no longer supported; users should utilize the new reporting features available in the AD Activity job.
- It is important to keep documentation updated to prevent confusion regarding available features and functionalities.
- For future inquiries about AD Activity integration, refer to the provided documentation links for detailed setup instructions.
