## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Comk5IAB
- **Case Number:** 414398
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ShelterPoint Life
- **Contact Name:** Paul Wasek
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Activity
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when attempting to run Active Directory (AD) Activity reports, specifically receiving the message: "Invalid object name 'dbo.SA_ADActivity_EventsView'. Unexpected exception: Encountered error: 'Sequence contains no matching element' while generating report."

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The issue occurred in the context of running AD Activity reports.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed whether the AD Activity job had been run after the upgrade to version 11.6.
2. Requested the customer to download and provide job log files for analysis.
3. Suggested executing a script on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console server to check the current build and installed components.
4. Inquired if the AD_ActivityCollection job had run successfully recently, as this is a common cause of report generation errors.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the customer not being licensed for the Active Directory Activity feature, which is necessary to run the AD Activity reports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to disable the AD Activity job group in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA). Additionally, the customer was shown how to retrieve the necessary data using the AD Inventory > 2-AD_Changes job, which does not require the AD Activity license.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to verify their licensing status before attempting to run specific features in Netwrix products.
- Future support interactions should include a check of the customer's licensing to prevent similar issues from arising.
