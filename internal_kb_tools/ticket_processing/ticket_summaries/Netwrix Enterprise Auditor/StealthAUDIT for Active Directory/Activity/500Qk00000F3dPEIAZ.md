- **Case Number:** 419449
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MDRC
- **Contact Name:** Terence Yip
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Activity
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Active Directory (AD) authentication monitoring job, which runs monthly, was not capturing any results. The database query indicated that only the last day's authentication data was available, specifically showing results only for 6/14.

## Environment Details
- **Monitoring Tool:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the job configuration to ensure it was set up correctly.
2. Checked the database directly using the same query to confirm the absence of authentication records.
3. Reviewed logs for any errors or warnings related to the Activity Monitor.
4. Attempted to restart the monitoring service to see if it would resume capturing data.
5. Consulted documentation for known issues related to the version in use.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was suspected that a bug in the software version being used was preventing the Activity Monitor from collecting AD authentications properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to the latest version. After the upgrade, the customer confirmed that the Activity Monitor began capturing AD authentications as expected.

## Notes
- It is recommended to keep the software updated to the latest version to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly monitor the job results and logs after upgrades to ensure that all functionalities are operating correctly.
- If issues persist after an upgrade, further investigation into logs and configurations may be necessary.
