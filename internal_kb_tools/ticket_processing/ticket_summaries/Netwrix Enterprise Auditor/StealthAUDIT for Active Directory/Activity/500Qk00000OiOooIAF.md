## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OiOooIAF
- **Case Number:** 443911
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Walmart, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Erich Beneke
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Activity
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on utilizing either StealthAudit or Stealth Intercept to investigate frequent account lockout issues occurring every five minutes within their banner domain. They were currently generating standard lockout reports that provided client hostnames and IP addresses but sought deeper insights into the sources of these lockouts.

## Environment Details
- **Domain:** Banner domain with frequent account lockouts
- **Existing Measures:** A script was implemented to auto-unlock accounts due to the inability of previous support engineers to identify lockout sources.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing lockout reports generated by the customer.
2. Discussed the limitations of standard reporting in identifying lockout sources.
3. Provided information on the Lockout Analyzer tool as a potential solution for deeper analysis.
4. Awaited confirmation from the customer regarding the next steps.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the frequent account lockouts was not explicitly identified during this case. The customer had not previously tracked the sources effectively, leading to the implementation of an auto-unlock script.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by referring the customer to the Lockout Analyzer tool, which is designed to provide more detailed insights into account lockout events. This tool would enable the customer to analyze lockout sources more effectively than their current reporting methods.

## Notes
- It is important for customers experiencing frequent account lockouts to utilize specialized tools like the Lockout Analyzer for better visibility into the underlying causes.
- Future support staff should be aware that auto-unlock scripts can mask the root cause of lockouts and should be used cautiously while investigating the issue.
