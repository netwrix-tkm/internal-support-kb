- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a query defined in the Host Management section was not displaying any hosts, showing an empty list instead.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to Active Directory Inventory (ADI) scans and custom SQL jobs affecting host lists.
- The customer was running full ADI scans, which completed successfully aside from warnings regarding custom attributes.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the initial empty host list issue, which was linked to a custom cleanup job that was incorrectly scheduled.
2. Investigated the troubled host list "AC - DC" and found many hosts missing data, either in "in queue" or "in progress" states.
3. Attempted to manually launch the troubled host list query, which failed due to permission issues.
4. Reviewed specific host lists:
   - **GRM_AD_APPLICATIONS**: Confirmed it was functioning correctly.
   - **GRM_AD_AZURE**: Found no hosts; manual query failed due to insufficient permissions.
   - **GRM_AD_EMEA**: Correct host count but missing details; disabled cleanup job and requested a manual query.
5. Confirmed that the AD_Scan transaction was blocked by a scheduled SQL database backup during the scan.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a scheduling conflict between the AD_Scan job and the SQL database backup, which blocked the scan from completing successfully. Additionally, a custom cleanup job was improperly configured, leading to the deletion of hosts that were still present in Active Directory.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following actions were taken:
- The AD_Scan job was rescheduled to a time that does not conflict with the SQL database backup.
- The custom cleanup job was disabled to prevent it from interfering with the host lists.
- A manual query was run for the GRM_AD_EMEA host list, which began to populate correctly after the cleanup job was disabled.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that scheduled jobs do not overlap with critical database operations to avoid blocking issues.
- Future configurations of custom jobs should be reviewed to ensure they do not inadvertently delete valid entries from host lists.
- The issue with the GRM_AD_EMEA host list not collecting details may require further investigation and escalation if it persists after manual scans.
