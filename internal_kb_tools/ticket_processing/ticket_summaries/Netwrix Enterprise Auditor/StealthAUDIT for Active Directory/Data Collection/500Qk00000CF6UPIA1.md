## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CF6UPIA1
- **Case Number:** 412848
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MUFG Bank, LTD.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Kong
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving Windows Security Auditing event 4662 during daily Active Directory Inventory (ADI) scans and sought clarification on whether the ADI job was performing operations on Active Directory (AD) objects.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Active Directory Weak Passwords job, which was not initially identified as the source of the events.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the ADI scan performs only read and list operations, as outlined in the documentation.
2. Asked the customer if they were seeing any 5136 (Directory Service Change) events that coincided with the 4662 events.
3. Recommended checking if the "Directory Service Access" subcategory of the audit policy was enabled, which logs read-only accesses as 4662 events.
4. Investigated the possibility of the ADI service account using incorrect credentials from the connection profile.
5. Discussed splitting the ADI scan into two separate jobs to isolate the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the Windows Security Auditing event 4662 was identified as the Active Directory Weak Passwords job, which was triggering the alerts, not the ADI job itself.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by disabling the Weak Passwords job, which stopped the generation of the 4662 events. Additionally, the ADI scans were split into two jobs, each using a separate connection profile to prevent credential conflicts.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the configuration of jobs in the Netwrix environment to ensure that they do not inadvertently trigger security auditing events.
- Future cases should consider checking for other jobs that may interact with AD objects if similar issues arise.
