## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CqPDAIA3
- **Case Number:** 414522
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** National Board of Medical Examiners
- **Contact Name:** Bob Langer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with tracking changes to several custom user, group, and computer attributes in Active Directory. Despite successfully adding the attributes to the "Custom Attributes" in the "User and Group Inventory Details" query and performing scans, the changes were not reflected in the reports.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Scan Type:** Full and Differential scans
- **Data Source:** Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Added custom attributes to the "Custom Attributes" section in the "User and Group Inventory Details" query.
2. Performed a full scan, which completed successfully.
3. Made manual changes to one of the custom attributes and performed a re-scan.
4. Changed the scan type back to differential and made additional changes, followed by another re-scan.
5. Reviewed the stats logs for warnings related to the scan.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by either:
- The ADI scan not collecting changes properly.
- The 2-AD_Changes job not being executed after the full scan.

## Solution
While reviewing the settings to document the issue, the customer discovered that the data was now appearing in the reports. It was unclear whether the customer had forgotten to re-enable change collection after the full scan or if they had missed running the 2-AD_Changes job. Regardless, the customer was able to find the desired data in the 2-AD_Changes > Attribute Changes report.

## Notes
- The warnings in the stats logs regarding certain custom attributes not being set in domain 1 did not affect the functionality of the scans.
- It is important to ensure that change collection is enabled after running a full scan and that the 2-AD_Changes job is executed to capture changes effectively.
- Future users should verify their settings if they encounter similar issues, as the resolution may involve simple oversight in configuration.
