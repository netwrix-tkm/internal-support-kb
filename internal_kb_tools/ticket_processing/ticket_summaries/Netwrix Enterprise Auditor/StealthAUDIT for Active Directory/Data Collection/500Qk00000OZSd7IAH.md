## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OZSd7IAH
- **Case Number:** 443475
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baker & McKenzie Global Services LLC
- **Contact Name:** Don Boncodin
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested clarification on how service accounts are identified in the AD_ServiceAccounts job and the criteria that must be met for accounts to be captured in the report.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.117

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the AD_ServiceAccounts job checks for the presence of a Service Principal Name (SPN) associated with accounts.
2. Reviewed prerequisites for the AD_ServiceAccounts job, ensuring that the AD_Scan job collects the `servicePrincipalName` and `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attributes.
3. Analyzed SQL queries used in the AD_ServiceAccounts job to identify filtering criteria for service accounts.

## Root Cause
The service accounts that were not reported in the AD_ServiceAccounts job lacked a Service Principal Name (SPN) associated with them, which is a key criterion for identification.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, it was recommended that the customer manually populate SPNs for the service accounts in Active Directory. Additionally, if the customer desired heuristic or behavior analysis for detecting service accounts, they were advised to submit a feature request through the Netwrix community.

## Notes
- Ensure that the AD_Scan job is configured to collect the necessary attributes (`servicePrincipalName` and `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes`) to facilitate accurate reporting in the AD_ServiceAccounts job.
- For future reference, if customers require advanced detection capabilities for service accounts, encourage them to submit feature requests to enhance product functionality.
