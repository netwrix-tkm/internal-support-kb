# Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IW2kHIAT
- **Case Number:** 427523
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Motors, LLC
- **Contact Name:** William Dammeier
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Active Directory Scan
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported performance issues with the Active Directory scan, specifically that the scan consistently fails or hangs during the "Group Usage" step, leading to incomplete data collection.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) Version:** 11.6.0.115
- **Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) Version:** 11.6.0.25
- **Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) Version:** 7.1.179
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided details about the impact of the issue on their business, indicating that scans were not completing in a timely manner, resulting in outdated data.
2. The customer confirmed that no changes had been made to the environment since the last successful scan.
3. The customer attempted to address potential disk space issues by making changes to the database.
4. The support team requested additional information, including software versions and logs from the affected systems.
5. Debug logging was enabled, and the customer was instructed to rerun the failing jobs to collect detailed logs.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a licensing problem. The NEA NAM license was no longer valid for Active Directory activity, which resulted in the "6.Activity" job group being disabled.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the "6.Activity" job group until the NEA NAM license was updated. The customer was informed that once the new license was obtained, the necessary components could be re-enabled to restore full functionality.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all necessary licenses are valid and up-to-date to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The customer was advised that re-enabling the job group may duplicate data already collected by the Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) system.
- The ticket was closed with the option to reopen within 30 days if related issues arise.
