## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GUwNBIA1
- **Case Number:** 422604
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AON Service Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Divyang Shah
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the account lockout job in StealthAUDIT sometimes fails to create alerts when an account is locked out.

## Environment Details
- **Job in Question:** "Active Directory" > Lockouts > AD_AccountLockouts
- **Public Domain Controllers:** 16 configured for monitoring
- **Previous Job Schedule:** Set to run every 15 minutes for 1 day, once a week.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Adjusted the job to the correct host list of 16 Public Domain Controllers.
2. Configured the scheduled task to repeat every 15 minutes starting at 7 AM indefinitely.
3. Ensured that the Event Log type was enabled on all 16 Public Domain Controllers.
4. Verified that the log size was sufficient to prevent rollover of the event log between scans.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the incorrect configuration of the job schedule and the Event Log settings on the Domain Controllers. The job was not set to run frequently enough, and the Event Logs were not adequately sized to retain necessary data for the scans.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correctly configuring the job to monitor the appropriate host list.
- Adjusting the job schedule to run every 15 minutes indefinitely.
- Ensuring that the Event Log type was enabled and that the log size was sufficient to avoid data loss between scans.

## Notes
- It is important to verify that the customer is using the correct version of the Lockouts job, as there is a newer version under AD Activity that may provide better functionality.
- Ensure that the Event Logs on Domain Controllers are monitored for size and retention settings to prevent similar issues in the future.
