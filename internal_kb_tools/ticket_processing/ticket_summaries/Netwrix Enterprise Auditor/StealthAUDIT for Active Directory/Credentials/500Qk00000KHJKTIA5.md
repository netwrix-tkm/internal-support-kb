## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KHJKTIA5
- **Case Number:** 431258
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Vertiv
- **Contact Name:** George Petkus
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported errors occurring during the execution of the Active Directory weak password scan job (`AD_WeakPasswords`). The job failed with a replication access denied error, which had previously not been an issue.

## Environment Details
- **Date of Issue:** 06/01/2025
- **Error Messages:**
  - `System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Replication access was denied`
  - `Could not retrieve schema info for SAConfigTbl Error: CommandText does not return a result set`
  
## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the `AD_WeakPasswords` job to reproduce the error.
2. Reviewed job logs for error messages indicating permission issues.
3. Confirmed that the job had previously been functioning correctly.
4. Investigated potential changes in permissions with the customer's IAM team.
5. Verified the required permissions for the account used in the connection profile:
   - Read
   - Replicating Directory Changes
   - Replicating Directory Changes All
   - Replicating Directory Changes in a Filtered Set
   - Replication Synchronization

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect credential format in the connection profile. The format used was `DOMAIN.LOCALusername`, which was not recognized correctly, leading to the replication access denied error.

## Solution
The resolution involved changing the credential format in the connection profile from `DOMAIN.LOCALusername` to `DOMAINusername`. This adjustment allowed the job to execute successfully without permission errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that the account used for running the `AD_WeakPasswords` job has the correct permissions and credential format to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify permissions and configurations, especially after any changes in the IAM policies or account settings.
