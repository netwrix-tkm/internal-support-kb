- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Marsh & McLennan Companies
- **Contact Name:** Graham Holmes
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with one of their domains following an upgrade to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The specific problems included:
1. Self-service functionality was not working, suspected to be due to credential issues.
2. Scans for the domain were taking significantly longer than expected.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed after an upgrade to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The affected component was StealthAUDIT for Active Directory.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed access logs which indicated that nearly 50,000 records were scanned over a 17-hour period, suggesting performance issues.
2. Investigated potential credential issues related to the self-service functionality.
3. Checked for any missing Service Principal Names (SPNs) and verified the configuration of the domain.
4. Engaged with the development team for further investigation and potential fixes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issues was identified as improper functioning of the Active Directory Integration (ADI) scans after the upgrade to version 11.6, which led to both the self-service functionality failure and the prolonged scan times.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after ensuring that the ADI scans were properly configured and running. Once the scans were functioning correctly, the self-service feature also began to work as expected, alleviating the disruptions to the service offering.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the configuration of ADI scans after any upgrades to ensure that all functionalities operate as intended.
- Customers should be advised to monitor scan performance and self-service functionalities closely following upgrades, as issues may arise that require immediate attention.
