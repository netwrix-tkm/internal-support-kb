## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000PdT74IAF
- **Case Number:** 446347
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Idaho State Controllers Office
- **Contact Name:** Phil Cooks
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that dynamic user accounts created in a second domain were not appearing as deleted in the Netwrix system, despite being removed from the external Active Directory (AD). These accounts are programmatically created at midnight and deleted before midnight each day.

## Environment Details
- **Domain:** sco.idaho.gov
- **Dynamic Account Creation/Deletion:** Daily at approximately 00:00 and just before midnight.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the Netwrix Help Article on granting permissions for deleted accounts to the VaronisDCDMZ AD account.
   - [Granting Permissions for 'Deleted Objects' Container](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/1Secure/page/Content/1Secure/Admin/DataCollection/ActiveDirectory/PermissionsADContainer.htm)
   
2. Attempted to test if the VaronisDCDMZ AD account could search for deleted objects based on SID.
   ```powershell
   get-adobject -Filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects" -and objectSID -like "Enter SID here"' -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties samaccountname,displayname,objectsid
   ```

3. The initial run returned 14,886 users for the "sco.idaho.gov" domain.

4. Modified the Active Directory Inventory settings:
   - Navigated to: `.Active Directory Inventory > 1-AD_Scan > Configure > Queries > Options`
   - Deselect "Collect only updates since the last scan".

5. Ran the AD Inventory job again. This time, only 495 users were displayed under the "sco.idaho.com" domain.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the setting "Collect only updates since the last scan" being enabled, which prevented the system from accurately reflecting the deleted accounts. By deselecting this option, the system was able to perform a full inventory scan and correctly identify the current state of user accounts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deselecting the "Collect only updates since the last scan" option in the Active Directory Inventory settings.
- Running the AD Inventory job again, which resulted in the correct number of users being displayed (495 users).

## Notes
- It is advisable to regularly check the settings for the Active Directory Inventory to ensure that they align with the expected behavior, especially when dealing with dynamic accounts that are frequently created and deleted.
- Future users should be aware that changing inventory settings may slightly increase processing time but is necessary for accurate data collection.
