- **Case Number:** 431104
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baker & McKenzie Global Services LLC
- **Contact Name:** Don Boncodin
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6.0.72

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the "AD_WeakPasswords" job was failing with an error message indicating "System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Replication access was denied." This issue occurred when attempting to use a group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for the job.

## Environment Details
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version: 11.6.0.72
- gMSA account configured for use in the connection profile.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the gMSA account was a member of the built-in Domain Administrators group.
2. Attempted to add the gMSA account using both "Managed Service Account" and "Application" password storage options, both resulting in "Access Denied" errors.
3. Checked permissions and configurations for the gMSA account.
4. Suggested adding the user account that started the NEA console to the list of principals allowed to retrieve managed passwords.
5. Executed PowerShell commands to modify the `principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword` property for the gMSA account.
6. Tested the job execution after modifying the permissions.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the gMSA account not having the necessary permissions to retrieve the managed password due to an incorrectly configured `principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword` property. The property needed to include the Distinguished Names (DNs) of the NEA host, the user account running the NEA console, and the account configured for scheduled tasks.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Adding the user account that started the NEA console to the `principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword` property of the gMSA account using the following PowerShell commands:
   ```powershell
   # Get current list of allowed principals
   $x = (Get-ADServiceAccount gMSA_acc -Properties principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword).principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword

   # Add the user account's distinguished name
   $x += (get-aduser ADuser).distinguishedname

   # Update the gMSA account with the new list
   Set-ADServiceAccount gMSA_acc -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword $x
   ```
2. After updating the permissions, the gMSA account was successfully added to the connection profile using "Managed Service Account" password storage, and the "AD_WeakPasswords" job completed successfully.

## Notes
- It is recommended to use a security group for managing the `principalsallowedtoretrievemanagedpassword` property to simplify the management of users and service accounts that require access.
- Ensure that all necessary accounts (both user and service accounts) that will run jobs or access the NEA console are included in the security group to avoid similar issues in the future.
