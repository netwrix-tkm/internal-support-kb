## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Bg2dPIAR
- **Case Number:** 411545
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Connie Liang
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Inventory
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a custom Active Directory (AD) scan analysis created under version 11 had disappeared from the GUI after upgrading to version 11.5. The analysis was necessary for licensing counts, and the customer was unsure how to import or recreate it in the StealthAUDIT interface.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 11
- **Current Version:** 11.5
- **File Path of Existing Analysis:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Jobs\GROUP_.Active Directory Inventory\JOB_1-AD_Scan\VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Closed all open instances of StealthAUDIT.
2. Moved the `JOB_1-AD_Scan` folder from the archived jobs folder in `%SAInstallDir%\Jobs` to the desktop.
3. Copied the `JOB_1-AD_Scan` folder from the desktop back to `%SAInstallDir%\Jobs\GROUP_.Active Directory Inventory`.
4. Right-clicked the folder to verify it was not blocked and removed the "Read Only" checkbox.
5. Went to Control Panel, selected "Change," and then "Repair" on StealthAUDIT.
6. Checked if the analysis for `SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers` was visible after the repair.

## Root Cause
The analysis task was missing because the ADI job was not upgraded in place during the transition to version 11.5, which resulted in the removal of the analysis task.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following these steps:
1. Close all instances of StealthAUDIT.
2. Move the `JOB_1-AD_Scan` folder to the desktop.
3. Copy the folder back to the appropriate directory.
4. Ensure the folder is not blocked and is not set to "Read Only."
5. Repair the StealthAUDIT installation via Control Panel.
6. After the repair, the analysis for `SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers` became visible again.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all jobs are upgraded in place during version upgrades to prevent loss of configurations.
- A tailored knowledge base article can be created to guide users on restoring archived jobs post-upgrade.
