## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Jf3BuIAJ
- **Case Number:** 430245
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Osaic
- **Contact Name:** James Foreman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Inventory
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported SQL errors occurring during the last run of the Active Directory Inventory job. The error message indicated that the login failed due to the account being from an untrusted domain, which cannot be used with Integrated authentication.

## Environment Details
- **Client IP:** 10.128.104.165
- **Domain:** pw1appstau01a.ibddomain.net
- **Error Message:** "Login failed. The login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with Integrated authentication."

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message and identified the issue with Integrated authentication from a non-trusted domain.
2. Confirmed that Windows authentication type accounts cannot log into SQL servers from non-trusted domains.
3. Analyzed the stack trace provided, which indicated an `ActiveDirectoryServerDownException` and `RPC server is unavailable` errors.
4. Compared the case with similar previous cases (00357899 and 00382211) to identify patterns or common resolutions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the use of a Windows authentication account attempting to connect to the SQL server from a non-trusted domain, which is not permitted.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the customer was advised to use a SQL Server authentication account instead of a Windows authentication account for the Active Directory Inventory job. This change allowed the job to run successfully without encountering the domain trust issue.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any SQL Server connections from non-trusted domains utilize SQL Server authentication to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Future configurations should be reviewed to confirm that authentication methods align with domain trust settings to prevent disruptions in service.
