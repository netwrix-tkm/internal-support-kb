- **Case Number:** 439500
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CRH Americas Materials
- **Contact Name:** Frank Babcock
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Inventory

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving warnings and errors during an Active Directory (AD) Inventory Scan, specifically indicating that "A full ADI scan may be required." The customer believed that disabling the "Collect only updates since the last scan" option would result in a full scan, but errors persisted even after this adjustment.

## Environment Details
- The customer operates multiple domains, and some custom attributes are not present across all domains.
- The LDAP server was unavailable for one domain due to limited connections and blocked LDAP ports.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs provided by the customer after enabling debug logging for the AD_Scan job.
2. Identified that some analysis tasks were using a placeholder `[tablename]` instead of the actual table name.
3. Discussed the warnings related to custom attributes that were not set in all domains.
4. Investigated the "LDAP server unavailable" error and confirmed it was due to blocked LDAP ports.
5. Suggested dropping the ADInventory tables for the affected domain and re-running the AD scan.

## Root Cause
- The errors were primarily caused by:
  - Analysis tasks in the AD_Scan job using a placeholder for table names.
  - Custom attributes being audited that were not present in all domains, leading to warnings.
  - An LDAP server being unavailable due to blocked ports.

## Solution
- The following actions resolved the issue:
  - Updated the SQL queries in the analysis tasks to replace the placeholder `[tablename]` with the actual table names.
  - Dropped the ADInventory tables for the domain `omg.crhomg.com` and re-ran the AD scan, which successfully repopulated the tables without errors.
  - The customer was informed that the remaining warnings regarding custom attributes were expected and could be addressed by either adding the attributes to the domains or removing them from the scan configuration.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any custom attributes included in the AD_Scan job are present in all target domains to avoid unnecessary warnings.
- When encountering LDAP connection issues, verify that the necessary ports are open and that the domain controllers are not heavily restricted.
- For future reference, if using dynamic host lists for AD scans, ensure that the job filters out domain controllers with restricted access.
