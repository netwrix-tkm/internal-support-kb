- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MTN Nigeria
- **Contact Name:** Emmanuel Eze
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the stale users report was incorrectly identifying active users as stale. They requested assistance in investigating this issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The stale users report was generated using the StealthAUDIT for Active Directory collector.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to gather details about the issue.
2. Requested the customer to provide information on the impact of the issue, affected users, and any troubleshooting steps already taken.
3. Suggested enabling debug logging in the NEA Console and rerunning the jobs to collect detailed logs.
4. Requested logs from specific directories and an export of the job configurations for analysis.
5. Analyzed the provided logs and configurations to identify the root cause.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the default configuration of the stale user inactivity threshold, which was set to 60 days. This setting did not align with the customer's expectations for identifying stale users.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the configuration of the stale user inactivity threshold from the default 60 days to a value that better suited the customer's requirements. This adjustment ensured that the stale users report accurately reflected the status of users in the Active Directory.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to review and configure the stale user inactivity threshold according to their specific needs to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular communication with the customer is crucial to gather necessary information and expedite the troubleshooting process.
