## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J2xVkIAJ
- **Case Number:** 428702
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SS&C Technologies
- **Contact Name:** Daniel McLaughlin
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Domains
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer experienced issues accessing Group Policy Object (GPO) collections from a domain that does not have a trust relationship with the domain where the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application server is located. The issue was compounded by the customer's implementation of a hardened least privilege model.

## Environment Details
- **Source Domain:** ssnc-corp.global (where the NEA server is located)
- **Target Domain:** ssnctest.ssncad.global
- **Authentication Method:** Kerberos
- **Registry Settings Affected:** UNC hardening settings on the NEA server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run GPO collections via task scheduler, which failed.
2. Reviewed job logs from both successful and failed runs.
3. Identified that the issue was related to Kerberos authentication when accessing the SYSVOL share.
4. Relaxed UNC hardening settings on the NEA server, which allowed access to GPOs.
5. Changed registry settings under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkProvider\HardenedPaths`:
   - Set `RequireMutualAuthentication=0`
   - Set `RequireIntegrity=0`
   - Set `RequirePrivacy=1`
6. Conducted tests with and without UNC hardening to confirm behavior.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict with Windows permissions and Kerberos authentication requirements when accessing the SYSVOL share across domains without a trust relationship. The hardened UNC settings on the NEA server were preventing successful authentication.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by demonstrating that the problem was related to Windows permissions rather than a defect in the Netwrix product. The customer was advised to adjust the UNC hardening settings on the NEA server, which allowed for successful access to the SYSVOL share and GPO information collection. The customer confirmed that the behavior was consistent with previous experiences using Netwrix Auditor.

## Notes
- It is important to note that relaxing UNC hardening settings may expose the system to security vulnerabilities. This should be done with caution and in accordance with the organization's security policies.
- Future cases involving cross-domain access without trust relationships should consider the implications of Kerberos authentication and UNC hardening settings.
- The customer was informed that the workaround used in previous Netwrix Auditor cases (using remote PowerShell with SSL) would not apply in this scenario due to the nature of the connection over SMB using Kerberos.
