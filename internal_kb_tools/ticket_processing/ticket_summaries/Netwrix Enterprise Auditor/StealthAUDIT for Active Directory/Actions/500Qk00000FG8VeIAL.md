## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FG8VeIAL
- **Case Number:** 419843
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited
- **Contact Name:** James Allen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Actions
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Action Module in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor where an action to add tags to certain files resulted in an error: "Invalid column name 'RowKey'." The customer was unable to see the custom tags they had set up, only the default ones.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The customer was utilizing the StealthAUDIT for Active Directory component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the tagging job and ensured proper setup of the tags.
2. Conducted tests in the lab to replicate the issue.
3. Advised the customer to enable specific options and re-scan the files.
4. Reviewed the action logs for errors related to file access and permissions.
5. Suggested restarting the server and checking job results again.
6. Investigated permissions for the service account used in the tagging job.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a permissions problem. The service account used for the tagging job did not have the necessary read and write permissions to access and modify file metadata. Additionally, there was a discrepancy in the configuration of the temp table in the SQL ScriptEditor, which affected the tagging process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Ensuring that the service account had both read and write permissions on the files being processed.
- Modifying the configuration in the SQL ScriptEditor to reference the correct file (newdata1.csv instead of newdata2.csv).
- Confirming that the FSAA job was set to collect file-level details correctly.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions to read and modify file metadata for successful tagging.
- Future cases should verify the configuration of the SQL ScriptEditor and ensure that the correct files are referenced in the tagging job.
- If similar issues arise, check the action logs for specific error messages related to file access and permissions.
