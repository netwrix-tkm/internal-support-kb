- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Actions
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the AD_ActivityCollection job was failing with an "access denied" error when executed. Despite following the setup documentation, the job did not function as expected.

## Environment Details
- The job requires Netwrix Activity Monitor (SAM) API Access.
- It also requires read access to the SAM Log Archive location.
- The configuration was copied from a production environment where the Active Directory server settings were identical.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the job configuration against the setup documentation.
2. Checked permissions for the SAM Log Archive location.
3. Attempted to run the AD_ActivityCollection job, which resulted in the same access denied error.
4. Reviewed the logs to identify any discrepancies in the job setup.

## Root Cause
The AD_ActivityCollection job was incorrectly configured to import Activity Monitor logs from itself, which is not a valid source. This misconfiguration led to the access denied error.

## Solution
The job was reconfigured to correctly import Activity Monitor logs from the appropriate source rather than attempting to pull from itself. After making these adjustments, the job ran successfully without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that future configurations for the AD_ActivityCollection job specify the correct log source to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to double-check permissions and configurations when migrating settings from one environment to another, even if the environments are similar.
