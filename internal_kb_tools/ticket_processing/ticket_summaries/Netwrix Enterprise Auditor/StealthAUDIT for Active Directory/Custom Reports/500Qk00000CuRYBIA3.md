## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CuRYBIA3
- **Case Number:** 414695
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gastro Health
- **Contact Name:** Marcos Lopez
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that accounts were being created, but an error message was encountered during report generation. The error stated: "Unexpected exception: Encountered error: 'The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.'"

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Not specified, but the issue relates to path length limitations in Windows.
- **Path Length Limitation:** The error is associated with Microsoft's file path length restrictions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the report location path length:
   - Path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports\v3\GH-SBAPPPages\Data\{3D618B6F-901C-48DD-B7AA-13D13922F9FA}_0_0.csv`
   - Confirmed that the path was well under the 248 character limit.
2. Checked the registry key for LongPaths on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor system and confirmed it was enabled.
3. Reviewed the job location path length:
   - Path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Jobs\GROUP_Gastro Health Onboarding Offboarding\GROUP_1. Create New\JOB_Create New Employees` (140 characters).
4. Attempted to reproduce the issue in a lab environment but was unsuccessful.
5. Conducted a meeting to discuss the issue and gather additional logs/screenshots.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the job name being too long due to an extra space. The job name "Create New Employees" exceeded the character limit when combined with the path length, leading to the error message.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by shortening the job name from "Create New Employees" to "Create NewEmployees" by removing the space. This adjustment brought the total character count within the acceptable limits, allowing the report to generate successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor job names and paths to ensure they remain within the character limits imposed by Windows.
- Customers should be informed about the potential for path length issues, especially when creating custom reports or jobs.
- For future reference, consider checking the registry settings for LongPaths if similar issues arise, as this can sometimes mitigate path length limitations.
