## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MXIUZIA5
- **Case Number:** 437629
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Marsh & McLennan Companies
- **Contact Name:** Graham Holmes
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested functionality to produce effective access reports for multiple Group NTAccounts in bulk using MSSQL, as the existing system only allowed querying one group at a time.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing functionality of the AIC for effective access reporting.
2. Discussed potential solutions with the customer, including the use of custom SQL queries or reports.
3. Suggested the FS_ShareAUDIT job as a potential out-of-the-box solution for generating effective access reports.
4. Explored modifications to the Ad Hoc trustees job to accommodate group permissions.
5. Conducted tests to verify the output of the modified Trustee Permissions job.

## Root Cause
The limitation was due to the existing functionality of the Netwrix system, which did not support bulk querying of effective access for multiple groups simultaneously.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the Ad Hoc trustees job to allow for group permissions. This modification enabled the customer to generate effective access reports for multiple groups in a single operation. It was noted that while this solution worked, it was not the intended use of the feature, and professional services were recommended for a more robust solution.

## Notes
- The modified job outputs a significant amount of data, which may require additional processing in SQL for manageability.
- Future requests for similar bulk reporting functionalities should consider involving professional services for custom report development.
- It is advisable to document any modifications made to standard jobs for future reference and troubleshooting.
