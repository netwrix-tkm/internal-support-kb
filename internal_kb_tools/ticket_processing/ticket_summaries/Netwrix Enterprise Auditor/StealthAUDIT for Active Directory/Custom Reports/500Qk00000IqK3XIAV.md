## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IqK3XIAV
- **Case Number:** 428257
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Overseas Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC)
- **Contact Name:** Shashitharan Navandran
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a custom report in StealthAUDIT was not running as expected. The report was intended to provide output on Admin Group Membership changes, specifically for new Admin Groups following the decommissioning of an old domain.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Product Version:** 11.0
- **Build Number:** 11.0.122.1018

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician reviewed the custom job configuration pointed at the StealthIntercept database.
2. The technician confirmed that the old domain had been decommissioned and discussed the need to configure the new Admin Groups in the job settings.
3. A meeting was held with the customer to clarify the requirements for the report and to ensure the correct Admin Group was set.
4. Follow-up communications were sent to check for updates on the internal teamâ€™s decision regarding the Admin Group configuration.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily due to the custom job not being configured with the correct Admin Group settings after the decommissioning of the old domain. The report was still pointing to outdated configurations, which prevented it from running successfully.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer to configure the correct Admin Group in the StealthAUDIT job settings. Once the appropriate group was set, subsequent reports were expected to run correctly and provide the required output.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to ensure that any changes in domain structure or group memberships are reflected in their report configurations to avoid similar issues in the future.
