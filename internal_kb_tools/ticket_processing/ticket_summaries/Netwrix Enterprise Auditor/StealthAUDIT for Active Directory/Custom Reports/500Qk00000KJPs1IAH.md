- **Case Number:** 431324
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Tyson Foods
- **Contact Name:** Waseem Khan
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, Tyson Foods, requested guidance on how to enable tracking for unusual CLDAP activity and LSASS crashes within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The development team indicated that tracking CLDAP events might not be feasible without specific steps to generate such events.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to monitoring CLDAP traffic, which utilizes UDP and port 389.
- The customer is using version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Engaged in discussions via the SWAT channel to gather insights on tracking CLDAP.
2. Conducted research on CLDAP to identify potential methods for generating events.
3. Created a custom Smart log NEA job to collect LSASS crash event IDs from domain controllers.
4. Sought input from the NTP team regarding CLDAP tracking capabilities.

## Root Cause
The inability to track CLDAP activity was primarily due to the lack of existing mechanisms within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to monitor such events without predefined steps to generate them.

## Solution
The issue was partially addressed by creating a custom Smart log NEA job that collects LSASS crash event IDs. However, tracking CLDAP activity remains unresolved as further research is needed to establish a method for generating relevant events.

## Notes
- Future attempts to track CLDAP activity should focus on generating specific events that can be monitored.
- It is advisable to keep abreast of updates from the development team regarding potential enhancements for tracking CLDAP in future versions of the product.
- The customer should be informed that while LSASS crash events can be monitored, CLDAP tracking may require additional tools or methods outside of the current capabilities of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
