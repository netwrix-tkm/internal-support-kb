## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C920VIAR
- **Case Number:** 412655
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Alliant Energy Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Mica LaBarge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in building three custom reports:
1. A report of all Azure usernames beginning with "AZ".
2. A list of Active Directory groups that have members whose usernames begin with "V0", "DA", or "P0".
3. A list of users not affected by any group policies.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The data sources involved include Azure Active Directory and Active Directory.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a remote session with the customer to discuss report requirements.
2. Created a SQL view analysis for Azure usernames under the job `EntraID2. UsersAAD_List of AZ Users` to filter `SA_AzureADInventory_UsersView` for DisplayNames starting with "AZ".
3. Created a SQL view analysis for Active Directory groups under the job `Active DirectoryALI.PRI1.GroupsAD_GroupsWithPrivMembers` to filter `SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView` for SAMAccountNames starting with "V0", "DA", and "P0".
4. Informed the customer that the report for users not affected by group policies is not available out of the box and offered to reach out to Professional Services or submit a feature request.

## Root Cause
The inability to generate the report for users not affected by group policies was due to the limitations of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's out-of-the-box reporting capabilities.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Successfully creating the requested SQL view analyses for both Azure usernames and Active Directory groups.
2. Providing the customer with exportable reports that can be emailed.
3. Clarifying that the third report is not available out of the box and offering alternatives for future needs.

## Notes
- For future requests involving reports not available out of the box, consider reaching out to Professional Services or submitting a feature request to the development team.
- Ensure to document any custom SQL views created for future reference and potential reuse.
