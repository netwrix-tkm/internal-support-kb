## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IFqK5IAL
- **Case Number:** 426907
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Toyota Boshoku
- **Contact Name:** Alex Colto
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix database had crashed. Although they managed to recover the database, they requested support to check the status of all Netwrix services and configurations, as all current scheduled jobs were failing.

## Environment Details
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Operating System:** Windows Server 2022 (as indicated in later communications)
- **Security Configuration:** Implementation of gMSA accounts for security concerns.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Contacted the customer to confirm their contact number and requested additional information regarding the issue.
2. Suggested restarting all Netwrix Enterprise services by stopping and starting them again.
3. Requested the following information from the customer:
   - Impact of the issue on their business.
   - Who is affected by the issue.
   - Steps already taken to troubleshoot.
   - Any changes in the environment since the last successful operation.
   - Software currently installed.
4. Advised enabling debug logging in the NEA Console and rerunning the failing jobs to collect detailed logs.
5. Requested logs from specific locations for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a crash of the Netwrix database, which led to the failure of scheduled jobs. The database was restored by the client, but subsequent configuration issues arose due to changes in the environment, including the migration to new servers and the implementation of gMSA accounts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the database was restored successfully. The customer was advised to create separate tickets for ongoing issues related to agent installations and connectivity problems with the Access Information component. Specific guidance was provided regarding the permissions and ports required for agent installations.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all necessary ports are open for agent installations, as indicated in the permissions/ports matrix available in the Netwrix documentation.
- Future issues related to the Stealth intercept console should be handled in a separate ticket, as it pertains to a different product.
- Customers should be encouraged to provide detailed information about their environment and any changes made when reporting issues to facilitate quicker resolutions.
