## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Cq5ZQIAZ
- **Case Number:** 414497
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Osaic
- **Contact Name:** James Foreman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Active Directory Permissions Analyzer
- **Version:** 11.5.0.257

## Problem Description
The customer reported that database usage was significantly higher than usual, with a specific job running for over 10 hours and consuming more than 800 GB of disk space before it was manually stopped. The issue was suspected to be related to the addition of the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer to their license.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) Version:** 11.5.0.257
- **Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) Version:** 11.5.0.136
- **SQL Server:** Configured as a failover
- **Recovery Model:** Initially set to Full, later recommended to be set to Simple.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the versions of the Netwrix applications running in the environment.
2. Reviewed database sizing and found it within expected limits.
3. Noted that the transaction log was over 400 GB with 100% of the space marked as unused.
4. Executed SQL commands to truncate and drop bloated temporary tables:
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3];
   TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2];
   TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp];

   IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3]') AND type in (N'U'))
       DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3];

   IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2]') AND type in (N'U'))
       DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2];

   IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp]') AND type in (N'U'))
       DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp];

   IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_AD_GroupStamping_Log') AND type in (N'U'))
       DROP TABLE SA_AD_GroupStamping_Log;

   IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_AD_GroupStamping_DailyActions') AND type in (N'U'))
       DROP TABLE SA_AD_GroupStamping_DailyActions;
   ```
5. Reached out to the customer to correct the license and scheduled a follow-up meeting for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the configuration of the SQL Server database recovery model being set to Full, which led to excessive growth of the transaction log. Additionally, the specific SQL query used in the job was causing significant resource consumption due to the way it handled temporary tables.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Changing the recovery model of the database from Full to Simple to prevent excessive transaction log growth.
2. Cleaning up the bloated temporary tables that were consuming unnecessary space.
3. Providing guidance on optimizing the SQL queries used in the jobs to reduce their resource consumption.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the database regularly and adjust the recovery model based on the usage patterns.
- Future jobs should be tested in a controlled environment to assess their impact on database performance before deployment.
- Ensure that all relevant components, such as the Access Information Center, are properly installed to avoid errors during PowerShell script execution.
