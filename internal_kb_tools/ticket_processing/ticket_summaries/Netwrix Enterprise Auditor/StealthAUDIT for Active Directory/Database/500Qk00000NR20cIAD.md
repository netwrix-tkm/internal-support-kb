## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NR20cIAD
- **Case Number:** 440332
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Micron Technology, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Kurtis Andersen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Active Directory Inventory
- **Version:** 11.6.0.138

## Problem Description
The Active Directory (AD) inventory process was reporting successful authentication to the target domain controller; however, data collection was failing. The logs indicated a script error, and the analysis tasks were failing due to SQL errors stating that certain tables/views did not exist.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.138
- **Database Collation:** Initially set to case-sensitive, which is not supported by the Enterprise Auditor.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a scheduled task and manually initiated the AD inventory.
2. Observed that the task ran for approximately 10 seconds before failing.
3. Checked the connection status table, which reported access granted.
4. Analyzed the scan log, which showed a script error related to invalid columns.
5. Attempted to drop the ADI tables, but the job failed with similar error messages.
6. Reviewed database permissions and confirmed that the account had the necessary permissions to create tables/views.
7. Engaged in discussions with the customer to gather logs and further details about the errors encountered.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by the SQL Server collation settings. The database was configured with case-sensitive collation, which is incompatible with the requirements of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Solution
The resolution involved the customer reinstalling SQL Server with the required case-insensitive collation settings. After the reinstallation, the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was also reinstalled. This corrected the issue, allowing the AD inventory process to run successfully without errors.

## Notes
- **Important Warning:** Ensure that SQL Server is configured with case-insensitive collation settings when installing the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to avoid similar issues in the future.
- **Documentation Reference:** For further details on supported configurations, refer to the Netwrix documentation on database collation settings.
