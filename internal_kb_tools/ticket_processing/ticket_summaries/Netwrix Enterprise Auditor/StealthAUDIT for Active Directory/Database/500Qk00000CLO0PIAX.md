## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CLO0PIAX
- **Case Number:** 413163
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Lori Crane
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Active Directory
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the "Domain Controllers Overview" job in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor returned errors indicating invalid column and object names when attempting to generate a report.

## Environment Details
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Build Number:** 276
- **Previous Version:** 11.5.0.182

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected evidence of duplicate entries in the Active Directory jobs.
2. Attempted to run the job and noted the following errors:
   - Invalid column name "Bridgehead_Server"
   - Invalid object name 'dbo.SA_AD_DCSummary_List'
   - Invalid object name 'dbo.SA_AD_DCSummary_DomainSummary'
3. Suggested running a PowerShell script to check installed versions of relevant applications.
4. Reviewed job properties and permissions for the AD_DomainInfo job.
5. Deleted duplicate entries from various tables in the StealthAUDIT database.
6. Re-ran the jobs after cleanup, but the issue persisted.
7. Upgraded the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 11.5.0.276.
8. Conducted a PowerShell Compare-Object to ensure job queries matched the latest version.
9. Scheduled meetings for further investigation and troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by duplicate entries in the StealthAUDIT database, which led to invalid references in the SQL queries used by the reporting jobs. Additionally, the initial version of the software had known issues that were resolved in later patches.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Cleaning up the database by removing duplicate entries from the relevant tables.
2. Upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 11.5.0.276, which included fixes for the identified errors.
3. Running the jobs again after the cleanup and upgrade, which resulted in successful execution without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that the database is regularly maintained to prevent duplicate entries.
- Always verify permissions for the AD_DomainInfo job to ensure it has the necessary access.
- For future upgrades, check the release notes for known issues and fixes that may affect job execution.
