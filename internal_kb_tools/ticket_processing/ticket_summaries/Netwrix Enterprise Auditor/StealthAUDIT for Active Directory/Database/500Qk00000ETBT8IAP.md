## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ETBT8IAP
- **Case Number:** 418210
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CRH Americas Materials
- **Contact Name:** Frank Babcock
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5.052

## Problem Description
The customer encountered an error while attempting to delete old domain data from the StealthAUDIT database. The error indicated conflicts with multiple foreign key constraints during the deletion process.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** StealthAUDIT
- **Domains:** 16 domains were to be dropped, with 4 expected to remain post-deletion.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run a job using the ADInventory Data Collector to drop the domains.
2. Encountered multiple SQL exceptions related to foreign key constraints during the deletion process.
3. Identified the need for a hotfix to resolve the conflicts.
4. Applied hotfix #11.5.052.
5. Reran the drop domain job after applying the hotfix.
6. Conducted a new ADI scan to verify the remaining domains.

## Root Cause
The issue arose because the domains that were being deleted had been decommissioned, leading to conflicts with existing foreign key constraints in the database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying hotfix #11.5.052, which addressed the foreign key constraint conflicts. After applying the hotfix, the drop domain job was successfully rerun, and a subsequent ADI scan confirmed that only the expected 4 domains remained in the report.

## Notes
- Ensure that any domains to be deleted are fully decommissioned and that all related data is handled appropriately to avoid foreign key constraint issues.
- Always check for available hotfixes or updates that may resolve known issues before attempting complex database operations.
