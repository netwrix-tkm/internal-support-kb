## Problem Description
The customer requested clarification on the definitions and classifications of various outputs generated from Active Directory (AD) Reports. Specific inquiries included the types of users audited, criteria for stale users, classifications of group memberships, and the meaning of 'Other' in privileged group memberships.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's inquiries regarding the AD Reports.
2. Identified that most of the requested information is available in the Help Center.
3. Scheduled a meeting to discuss the questions in detail.
4. Provided explanations based on the relevant article from the Help Center.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of understanding of the terminology and classifications used in the AD Reports generated by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The customer was not aware that detailed definitions were available in the Help Center.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by explaining the terms and classifications as outlined in the Help Center article: [Active Directory Exceptions](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/3-AD_Exceptions.htm). This provided the customer with the necessary definitions and clarifications regarding the output of the AD Reports.

## Notes
- It is important to direct customers to the Help Center for definitions and explanations of report outputs, as much of the information they seek may already be documented there.
- Future inquiries of a similar nature should consider a preliminary review of the Help Center resources before scheduling meetings, as this may expedite the resolution process.
