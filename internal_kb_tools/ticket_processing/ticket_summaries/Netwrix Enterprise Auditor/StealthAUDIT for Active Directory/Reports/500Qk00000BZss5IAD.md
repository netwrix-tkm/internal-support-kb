## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BZss5IAD
- **Case Number:** 411401
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MUFG Bank, LTD.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Kong
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the Netwrix Active Directory module has an out-of-the-box method to discover unresolved SIDs in Active Directory (AD) groups.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer suggested checking the Active Directory > 2. Users > SIDHistory job as a potential solution.
2. The customer was advised that if the SID data was missing from AD, the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) might not be able to retrieve it.
3. The customer explored connecting the GroupMembersView ADI table with the Users table to identify deleted users still associated with AD groups.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the absence of a built-in feature in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to directly report unresolved SIDs in AD groups. The customer needed a way to identify users whose accounts had been deleted but who still appeared in AD group memberships.

## Solution
The customer successfully created a custom view by connecting the GroupMembersView ADI table with the Users table and included the "isdeleted" attribute. This allowed them to identify users that still belonged to AD groups despite their actual AD accounts no longer existing. The customer found this solution useful and indicated it could be considered for an out-of-the-box report in the future.

## Notes
- A feature request was noted for the potential development of an out-of-the-box report for unresolved SIDs in AD groups, as the customer's use case highlighted a gap in existing functionality.
- Future users should be aware that while custom solutions can be implemented, they may require familiarity with SQL and the ADI table structure.
