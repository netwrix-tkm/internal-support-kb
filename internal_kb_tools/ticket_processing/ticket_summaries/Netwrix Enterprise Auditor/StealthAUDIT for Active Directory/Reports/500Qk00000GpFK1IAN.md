## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GpFK1IAN
- **Case Number:** 423411
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MDRC
- **Contact Name:** Terence Yip
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, Terence Yip, requested an audit report detailing password changes, including who made the changes, the nature of the changes (enable/disable/reset), the affected NT account, and the timestamp of the changes. He was unable to find such a report in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6
- **Data Collector:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing reports in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
2. Suggested using the "Account Changes Report" as a template for the required information.
3. Discussed the possibility of utilizing the SMARTLog Data Collector for enhanced reporting capabilities.
4. Provided links to relevant documentation for further assistance.
5. Confirmed the limitations of the reporting feature, specifically that data only appears when reports are sent as PDFs via email.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from the lack of a pre-built report that included all the requested details about password changes and account modifications. The existing reports did not provide the necessary granularity or the ability to view data in real-time.

## Solution
Terence successfully copied the existing "Account Changes Report" and modified it to include the required information about who locked/unlocked accounts and performed password changes. He discovered that the report data was only visible when the report was generated and sent as a PDF via email, which complicated the report-building process.

## Notes
- For future reference, users may consider using the SMARTLog Data Collector in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for more comprehensive data collection and reporting capabilities.
- It is advisable to check the documentation for creating custom reports that can join different data tables (e.g., AD_PasswordStatus_Details and AD_UserModifications_Details) if licensed for AD Activity.
- Users should be aware that report data visibility may vary based on how reports are generated and shared.
