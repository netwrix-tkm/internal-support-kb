## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory

1. Confirmed the customer's requirement to access detailed information from the AD Security Assessment report.

## Root Cause
The inability to drill down into the AD Security Assessment report was due to the default functionality of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which does not allow direct navigation from the summary to detailed views.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that direct navigation from the report summary to detailed information is not currently supported. However, they were provided with a Knowledge Base article that outlines how to manually find the necessary details in the respective job/report.

## Notes
- A Feature Request (FR ID: 46605187) has been created to consider adding the ability to navigate directly from the summary to the details page in future updates.
- Customers should be made aware that while the current functionality does not support direct navigation, the provided KB article can assist in obtaining the required information manually.
