- **Case Number:** 431221
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Brazoria County, TX
- **Contact Name:** Vincent Herrera
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature:** Password Analyzer
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while attempting to generate an Active Directory report regarding weak passwords. The error message displayed was:  
`'AD/daily/user/AD_weakpasswords "Job connection profile is not available"'`

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Active Directory
- **Feature Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Navigated to NEA > Jobs > Active Directory > 2.Daily > 2.Users > AD_WeakPasswords.
2. Right-clicked the "AD_WeakPasswords" Job and selected "Properties".
3. In the "Job Properties" popup, selected the "Connection" tab.
4. Chose the "Brazooria-Stealthbits-Collect" User Profile from the "Select one of the user defined profiles" dropdown and clicked "OK".

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the job connection profile not being set at the job level, which is a requirement for the specific job to function correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by assigning the appropriate user-defined connection profile ("Brazooria-Stealthbits-Collect") to the "AD_WeakPasswords" job. This allowed the job to connect successfully and generate the required report.

## Notes
- Ensure that a valid job connection profile is assigned to all relevant jobs to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Refer to the Netwrix help center documentation for guidance on configuring job connection profiles: [Netwrix Help Center](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectory/Users/Recommended.htm).
