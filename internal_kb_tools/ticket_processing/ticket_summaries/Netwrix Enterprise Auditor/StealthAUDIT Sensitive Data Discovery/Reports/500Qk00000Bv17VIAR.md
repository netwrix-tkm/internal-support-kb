- **Case Number:** 412058
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited
- **Contact Name:** James Allen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an "Active Sensitive Data" job, previously functioning correctly, had started taking an excessively long time to run, leading to premature termination of the job.

## Environment Details
- The job involved querying two views: `SA_FSDLP_MatchesView` and `SA_FSAA_ResourcesView`.
- The job was running against a SQL Server database.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested the customer to count the rows returned by the original SQL query to assess the volume of data being processed.
2. The customer reported that the job was taking approximately 47 minutes to complete.
3. The support engineer provided a rewritten SQL query to optimize performance and requested the customer to run it directly in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
4. The support engineer optimized the SQL script by excluding subqueries and adding a `DROP VIEW` statement before creating a new view.

## Root Cause
The original SQL script was inefficient due to the use of subqueries, which caused increased execution time as the volume of sensitive data criteria matches grew.

## Solution
The support engineer optimized the SQL script as follows:

**Original SQL Script:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT   [SourceTable1].[HostName], [SourceTable1].[CriteriaName], [SourceTable1].[FileName], [SourceTable1].[FilePath], [SourceTable1].[MatchCount]
FROM (select res.*  from [SA_FSDLP_MatchesView] as res ) as SourceTable1 
INNER join (select res.*  from [SA_FSAA_ResourcesView] as res ) as SourceTable2 
on ([SourceTable1].[ResourceID] = [SourceTable2].[ID])
WHERE ("SourceTable2"."DeletedUSN" is null)
```

**Optimized SQL Script:**
```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result') AND type in (N'V'))
DROP VIEW SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result

GO

CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT mv.[HostName], mv.[CriteriaName], mv.[FileName], mv.[FilePath], mv.[MatchCount]
FROM dbo.SA_FSDLP_MatchesView mv
JOIN dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourcesView rv ON mv.ResourceID = rv.ID
WHERE rv.DeletedUSN IS NULL
```
After implementing the optimized script, the job execution time was reduced to 29 seconds while still returning the same number of rows (642,016).

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the performance of SQL queries as the volume of data increases.
- Future optimizations may involve reviewing and refining SQL scripts to avoid subqueries and improve execution efficiency.
- Customers should be advised to run performance tests after any changes to SQL scripts to ensure improvements are realized.
