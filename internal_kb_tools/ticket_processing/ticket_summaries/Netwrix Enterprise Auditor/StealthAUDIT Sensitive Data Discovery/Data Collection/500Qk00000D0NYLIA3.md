- **Case Number:** 414901
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CTBC Bank
- **Contact Name:** Javier Gomez
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer, Javier Gomez from CTBC Bank, reported that while attempting to run a sensitive data report, the process timed out and the sign-in button on the portal was disabled. He also mentioned having log errors and was unsure how to send the logs for further support.

## Environment Details
- **StealthAUDIT (SA):** 11.5.0.160
- **SA Access Information (AIC):** 11.5.0.108
- **SA Sensitive Data (SDD):** 11.5.0.51
- **Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM):** 6.0.1111
- **CrowdStrike:** 7.15.18513.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the versions of the Stealth applications running in the environment.
2. Investigated the SEEK Scan ERROR related to long file paths exceeding 300 characters.
3. Enabled the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem` for `LongPathsEnabled = 1`, noting that this requires a reboot.
4. Checked the status of the StealthAUDIT Web Server (StealthAUDITWeb) and found it was not running, which prevented the site from loading.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the SEEK Scan ERROR related to long file paths exceeding 300 characters. Additionally, the StealthAUDIT Web Server was not running, which contributed to the inability to access the portal.

## Solution
- Enabled the `LongPathsEnabled` registry setting and advised a reboot of the server.
- Restarted the StealthAUDIT Web Server to ensure it was running, allowing access to the portal.
- After implementing these changes, the sensitive data scan completed successfully.

## Notes
- It is recommended to set the `LongPathsEnabled` value on the Windows File Server as well.
- Ensure that the StealthAUDIT Web Server is running to avoid similar access issues in the future.
- If issues persist, consider checking for other environmental factors that may affect server performance or connectivity.
