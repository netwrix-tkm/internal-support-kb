## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D5ideIAB
- **Case Number:** 415011
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eisai, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Sopan Wankhede
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that differential scans, when set to use the last scan date, were not identifying all files as expected. Specifically, files older than the last scan date were not being detected during subsequent depth scans.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** v11.6.0.72

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the differential scan settings and confirmed they were configured to pick up files modified since the last scan.
2. Conducted tests in the lab to reproduce the issue, including:
   - Running differential scans at various depths.
   - Comparing results with full scans to identify discrepancies.
3. Reviewed logs and results from previous scans to ensure no errors were present.
4. Engaged with development to understand the expected behavior of the differential scan logic.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect in the differential scanning logic, which only considers the actual modified date of files. If a file's modified date is not later than the last scan date, it is not picked up by the differential scan. This behavior was confirmed to be a known limitation of the system.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying an update for version 11.6 of the Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) component. This update addressed the differential scanning logic, allowing it to correctly identify files that had not been modified since the last scan but were still relevant based on their location in the directory structure.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the differential scan logic may not pick up renamed or copied files if their modified date remains unchanged. This limitation is documented and should be communicated to customers.
- Future updates may further enhance the differential scanning capabilities to account for such scenarios.
