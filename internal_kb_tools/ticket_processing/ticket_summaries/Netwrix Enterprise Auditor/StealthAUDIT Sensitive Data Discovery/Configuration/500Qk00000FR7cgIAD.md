- **Case Number:** 420326
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FCCI Services, Inc. (formerly FCCI Insurance Group)
- **Contact Name:** Curt Mcdonald
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6.0.84

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during a file system bulk import, specifically stating "DLPEX database does not exist, there is no data to import" for the Sensitive Data file review.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.84
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran a repair on the host, which did not resolve the issue.
2. Dropped the data from the host and rescanned the file server group.
3. Deleted all DLP data from T2 and executed the FS_SDD_DELETE job to clear the T1 database.
4. Upgraded to the latest version of StealthAUDIT (11.6.0.98).
5. Conducted a 0-level depth SEEK System Scan and incrementally increased the scan level.
6. Verified the service account permissions and access to the Cohesity NAS device.
7. Investigated the connection profile used for the SEEK system scan for proper permissions.
8. Adjusted settings related to LAT preservation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the LAT preservation option being enabled, which requires write permissions that were not available. This setting was causing the bulk import error as the system could not access the necessary files.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the LAT preservation option. After this change, the bulk import process was able to complete successfully without errors.

## Notes
- The LAT preservation option is only applicable for Windows environments; ensure it is disabled unless absolutely necessary.
- Always verify service account permissions and connection profiles when encountering similar errors related to file access and data imports.
