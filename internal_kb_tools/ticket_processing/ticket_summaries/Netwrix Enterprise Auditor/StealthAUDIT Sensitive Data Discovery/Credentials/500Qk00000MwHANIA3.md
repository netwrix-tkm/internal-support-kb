- **Case Number:** 438858
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WellSpan Health
- **Contact Name:** John Masgalas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had added false positives for passwords in both file path and network path formats, but these entries were still appearing in the sensitive data reports. Additionally, the customer encountered an "Out of memory" error when accessing the Sensitive Data object under Settings.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The issue involved the Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) feature.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the versions of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Sensitive Data Discovery were up to date.
2. Reviewed the configuration settings for sensitive data exclusion filters.
3. Conducted a meeting with the customer to discuss the issue and gather more details.
4. Added a line to the "Get Shares with SDD" analysis task on the table `SA_WS_OpenShares_SDD_Details`:
   ```sql
   AND mv.IsExcluded = 0
   ```
5. Explained that SDD false positives do not prevent scanning; they only exclude entries from reports.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the report configuration did not account for the "IsExcluded" column in the `SA_FSDLP_MatchesView`. This oversight led to false positives still appearing in the reports despite being marked for exclusion.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the report query to include the exclusion condition. The following SQL line was added to ensure that only entries not marked as excluded were displayed in the report:
```sql
AND mv.IsExcluded = 0
```
This adjustment allowed the WSH_FS_OpenAccessPasswords report to correctly reflect the exclusions set by the customer.

## Notes
- For sensitive data false positive exclusion filters, only UNC paths directly to the file (e.g., `HostShareFolderFile.txt`) are accepted. Local file paths (e.g., `C:xxxxxxxxx.txt`) do not work.
- The customer was advised that the documentation would be updated to clarify the accepted formats for SDD exclusions.
- The customer confirmed that the changes made resolved their issue, and they requested the case to be closed.
