## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ctd8HIAR
- **Case Number:** 414656
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Optiv
- **Contact Name:** Robert Parsons
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Active Directory Solution
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the "weak passwords job" in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically regarding the meaning of "trusted for delegation" and how it relates to the identification of "delegable admins" in Active Directory (AD). They needed clarification on the criteria used to determine if an account is a delegable admin and the associated risks.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry was related to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6.
- The customer was Trintech International, but the ticket was managed by Optiv.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the documentation for the AD_WeakPasswords Job and AD_UserDelegation Job in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
2. Communicated with the customer to gather specific questions regarding the criteria for "delegable admins."
3. Engaged with the development team to clarify the technical details behind the "delegable admin" designation.
4. Provided links to relevant resources for further understanding of delegated permissions in Active Directory.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity in the documentation regarding what constitutes a "delegable admin." Specifically, it was determined that accounts are considered delegable if:
- The account is not marked as "sensitive and cannot be delegated."
- The account is a member of an administrative group (e.g., Domain Admins).

## Solution
The development team confirmed that:
- The "delegable admin" status is checked against the `adminCount` attribute (where `adminCount = 1`).
- Accounts that are not marked as "sensitive and cannot be delegated" are eligible for delegation.
- Provided additional resources and links to help the customer understand the implications of delegable admins and how to manage them in Active Directory.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that sensitive accounts are configured correctly to prevent unauthorized delegation.
- The setting "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" should be enabled for privileged accounts to mitigate risks associated with account delegation.
- Future inquiries regarding similar issues should reference the specific criteria for "delegable admins" and the security implications of delegation in Active Directory.
