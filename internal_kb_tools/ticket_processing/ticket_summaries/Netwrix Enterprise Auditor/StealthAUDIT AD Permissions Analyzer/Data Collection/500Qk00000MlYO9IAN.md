- **Case Number:** 438291
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ORIX
- **Contact Name:** Vaigunth S V
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT AD Permissions Analyzer
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 10.0 and older

## Problem Description
The customer requested detailed information about three user accounts in their environment using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. They needed to know who owns the accounts, their usage, and recent activity.

## Environment Details
- The accounts in question were created in June and September of 2017.
- The accounts were part of the "Proofpoint Archive Search Users" group and belonged to the "OU=BFIM Service Accounts, OU=Boston Financial, OU=ORIX USA".

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed existing reports and user attributes related to the accounts.
2. Conducted a search for user activity using the Search Activity tool.
3. Compiled information from the Weak Password Report, which indicated all three accounts had weak passwords.
4. Gathered account creation dates and distinguished names from Active Directory.
5. Ran SQL queries against the database to extract detailed user information.
6. Discussed findings with the client during a scheduled meeting.

## Root Cause
The initial lack of detailed information about the accounts was due to the separation of user attributes and user activity data within the Netwrix system. The customer needed clarification on how to access and interpret this data effectively.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with comprehensive details about the three accounts, including:
- Account creation dates
- Last logon information (noted as NULL for all accounts)
- UserAccountControl settings
- SQL queries to extract further information from the database
- Guidance on using the Active Directory Inventory feature to find additional details.

The customer was also informed that if they had an IAM/IAG product, they could access archived data for these accounts.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to clients that not all information can be generated in a single report and that separate reports may be necessary for different monitoring plans.
- Future inquiries regarding user accounts should consider the distinction between user attributes and user activity to streamline the support process.
