## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GpASMIA3
- **Case Number:** 423389
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** DS Smith Group IT
- **Contact Name:** Ken Lake
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT AD Permissions Analyzer
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer was not returning any results. The logs indicated issues with retrieving schema information from the SAConfigTbl.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs which contained warnings related to SQL Server and job queue threads.
2. Attempted to run the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer without prerequisite jobs.
3. Checked the configuration settings for the Netwrix product to ensure they were correct.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect job execution order. The Active Directory Permissions Analyzer requires several prerequisite jobs to be completed before it can function properly.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following jobs were identified as necessary to run prior to executing the AD_ShadowAccess Job:
- ADInventory Job
- AD_SensitiveSecurityGroups Job
- AD_AdminSDHolder Job
- AD_DomainReplication Job
- AD_ResetPasswordPermissions Job
- AD_GroupMembershipPermissions Job

Once these jobs were executed, the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer returned results as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that all prerequisite jobs are completed before running the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the job queue and logs for any warnings or errors that may indicate configuration issues.
