- **Case Number:** 434220
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Doctors Company
- **Contact Name:** Chad Fontanini
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA for Nasuni
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were not receiving data for 3-4 Nasuni hosts.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor platform, specifically using the NEA for Nasuni component.
- The customer was running various levels of system scans to gather data from the Nasuni hosts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the FSAA System Scan, which had been running for an extended period (574 hours at a 12-level scan depth).
2. Attempted to run a 0-level scan to check for major issues with the host.
3. Noted access errors related to the host `NYNFILER102`, indicating issues with enumerating security descriptors and folder scans.
4. Verified the thread count for the job, confirming it was set to 15 with only 11 Nasuni hosts.
5. Discovered that the FSAC System Scan was targeting an individual host instead of the entire Nasuni host list.
6. Removed the individual host from the configuration and set the job to use the Nasuni host list.
7. Ran the activity group from the scheduled tasks after making the configuration change.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the FSAC System Scan was incorrectly configured to target an individual host rather than the complete Nasuni host list built by the discovery job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Reconfiguring the FSAC System Scan to target the Nasuni host list instead of an individual host.
- After this change, the customer was able to successfully run a 0-level and 3-level depth scan, as well as a Bulk Import, indicating that the data was now being collected correctly.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the scan configuration targets the correct host list to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the performance of scans, especially when running at deeper levels, to identify potential volume issues early on.
- Regularly verify thread counts and host configurations to ensure optimal performance during data collection tasks.
