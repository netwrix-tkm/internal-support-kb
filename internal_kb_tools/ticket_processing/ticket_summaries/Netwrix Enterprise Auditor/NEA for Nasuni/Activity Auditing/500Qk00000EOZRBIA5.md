- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while executing a FSAC scan job that scans an Activity Monitor agent for activity data on their Isilon filesystem. The scan succeeded for 10 out of 11 Access Zones, but failed for one, generating the following error message:

```
Error during processing: Could not open registry key SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesSBTLoggingParameters for reading: The system cannot find the file specified (2); local: False
```

## Environment Details
- **File System:** Isilon
- **Agent Type:** Netwrix Activity Monitor agent
- **Access Zones:** Multiple, with one zone causing the error

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message received during the FSAC scan job.
2. Checked the installation status of Netwrix Activity Monitor agents on the affected host.
3. Reviewed the host details page in StealthAUDIT - Host Management to ensure that "OS Name" and "OS Type" were populated correctly.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of the Netwrix Activity Monitor agent on the affected host. The error message indicated that the system could not find the specified registry key, which is typically present when the agent is installed.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Confirmed that the Netwrix Activity Monitor agent was not installed on the affected host.
2. Installed the Netwrix Activity Monitor agent on the host.
3. Re-ran the FSAC scan job, which then completed successfully without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that all hosts intended for activity monitoring have the Netwrix Activity Monitor agent installed to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the host details in StealthAUDIT to confirm proper configuration before executing scan jobs.
