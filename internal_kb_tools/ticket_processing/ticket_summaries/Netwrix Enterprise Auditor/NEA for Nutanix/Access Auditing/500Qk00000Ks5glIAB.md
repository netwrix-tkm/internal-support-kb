- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Saudi Investment Bank (SAIB)
- **Contact Name:** Pramod Sawant
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA for Nutanix
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6.0.117

## Problem Description
The customer reported an "Access Denied" error when running a File Share Access Auditing (FSAA) job against a Nutanix file share configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).

## Environment Details
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version: 11.6.0.117
- Nutanix file share with multiple domain-joined file servers
- The customer is located in EMEA (Saudi Investment Bank) with a preferred working time zone of +3 UTC.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified NEA and Nutanix configurations against the user guide.
2. Ensured that the Active Directory account in the connection profile had the "Backup Admin: Backup Access" role assigned.
3. Attempted to access the Nutanix share using the UNC path from the NEA server with the service account credentials.
4. Confirmed that the Netwrix EA server was included in the Nutanix "Filesystem Allowlist."
5. Collected logs from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for further investigation.
6. Engaged with Chris Brooks (Product Manager) for additional troubleshooting suggestions.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a configuration problem on the customer's side, where the correct permissions were not applied to the service account used for the FSAA job.

## Solution
After the customer adjusted the permissions for the service account to ensure it had the necessary access rights, the FSAA job was successfully executed without errors. The customer confirmed the resolution and requested to close the ticket.

## Notes
- Ensure that the service account used for accessing Nutanix shares has the appropriate permissions and is included in the "Filesystem Allowlist."
- Future cases should verify both the configuration settings in NEA and Nutanix, as well as the permissions assigned to the service account to prevent similar access issues.
