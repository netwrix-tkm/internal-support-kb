## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ma6qFIAR
- **Case Number:** 437784
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Marsh & McLennan Companies
- **Contact Name:** Graham Holmes
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a SQL Query job was showing the host as offline, despite the query validating correctly in the preview.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for SQL

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the SQL Query job configuration.
2. Checked the connectivity to the host.
3. Reviewed the settings related to host pinging.
4. Confirmed the behavior of the query in the preview mode.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the "Skip host if cannot Ping" option being enabled, which resulted in the host being marked as offline when it was not reachable via ping.

## Solution
The resolution involved disabling the "Skip host if cannot Ping" setting. After this adjustment, the SQL Query job was able to recognize the host correctly, and the issue was confirmed as resolved by the customer.

## Notes
- Ensure that the "Skip host if cannot Ping" option is reviewed during the configuration of SQL Query jobs, especially in environments where host connectivity may be intermittent.
- Future cases should consider checking host ping settings as a first step when encountering similar issues with host connectivity.
