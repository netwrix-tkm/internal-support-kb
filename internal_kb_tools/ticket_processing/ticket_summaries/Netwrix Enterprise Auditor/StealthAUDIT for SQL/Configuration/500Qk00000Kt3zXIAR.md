## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on how to view the actual SQL connection string being passed from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) to the monitored SQL servers.

## Environment Details
- The issue pertains to the SQL connection strings used by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The customer is utilizing both SQL Authentication and Windows Authentication for their SQL connections.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to search job logs for the phrase "setting connection string to" to locate the connection strings.
2. Two examples of connection strings were provided:
   - SQL Authentication:
     ```
     Data Source=REDACTED-SQLAUDIT;Initial Catalog=DATABASE;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=********;Connect Timeout=15
     ```
   - Windows Authentication:
     ```
     Data Source=j4ssp202;Initial Catalog=J4D_StealthAudit_AEM;Integrated Security=True;Persist Security Info=False;Password=********;Connect Timeout=15
     ```

## Root Cause
The issue was not a malfunction but rather a lack of knowledge on how to retrieve the SQL connection strings from the job logs of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Solution
The solution involved providing the customer with the method to find the SQL connection strings in the job logs by searching for the specific phrase "setting connection string to." This allowed them to see the actual connection strings being used for both SQL Authentication and Windows Authentication.

## Notes
- It is important for users to be aware that connection strings can be sensitive information. Ensure that any shared connection strings are appropriately redacted to protect sensitive data.
- Future users should remember to check job logs for connection strings if they encounter similar issues regarding SQL connections in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
