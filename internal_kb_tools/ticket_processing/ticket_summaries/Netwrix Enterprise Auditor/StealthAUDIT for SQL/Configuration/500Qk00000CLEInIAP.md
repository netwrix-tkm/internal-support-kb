## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CLEInIAP
- **Case Number:** 413159
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Regions Bank
- **Contact Name:** Jim Callison
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that an important production custom SQL job, which pulls login activity every few minutes, had stopped running and would not start. The investigation indicated that a hostlist record was missing.

## Environment Details
- **SQL Job:** Databases0.CollectionSQL4-SQL_ServerLogons
- **Job Frequency:** Scheduled to run every 1-2 minutes
- **Database Group:** Databases group scheduled to run every night

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the host list to ensure it was configured correctly.
2. Executed the SQL query to check for missing hostlist records:
   ```sql
   SELECT HM.Name, HM.FQDN, HM.hostID 
   FROM SA_HostMasterTbl AS HM 
   WHERE HM.hostID IN (
       SELECT HostListsContentTbl.hostID 
       FROM HostListsContentTbl 
       WHERE HostListsContentTbl.listID='{5D376271-0FAC-4B6B-A43A-9B26AAC0DC9D}'
   )
   ```
3. Confirmed that other jobs were running successfully using the same host list.
4. Investigated potential conflicts with other scheduled jobs, particularly the 2-SQL_PermissionsScan job, which was noted to cause lag or prevent the 4-SQL_ServerLogons job from starting.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a missing hostlist record that was necessary for the SQL job to execute properly. Additionally, conflicts with other scheduled jobs were contributing to the job's failure to run consistently.

## Solution
The customer reworked their login collection process, which resolved the issue. After the adjustments, the SQL jobs began to run as expected without further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary hostlist records are present before scheduling SQL jobs.
- Monitor for potential conflicts between scheduled jobs, especially when they are set to run in close succession.
- Consider reviewing job configurations periodically to prevent similar issues in the future.
