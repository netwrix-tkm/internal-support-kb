- **Case Number:** 432384
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 6.2

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a SQL scan on the 2750 server has been running since December 16, 2024, and is taking an excessively long time to complete.

## Environment Details
- The scan was initiated to process approximately 650 SQL servers simultaneously.
- The specific job affected is the 1-SQL_PermissionsScan Job.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided an initial response email requesting more information from the customer.
2. Moved the ticket to the EMEA region due to an invalid region assignment.
3. Checked the statistics on the job that had been running for over 30 days.
4. Confirmed that the job was still processing SQL servers of an undetermined total size (approximately 640).
5. Explained to the customer that scans of this scale can take a significant amount of time due to the volume of data being processed.
6. Recommended discussing the necessity of scanning all servers at once with Alison.
7. Suggested breaking the scan into smaller chunks and using filtering options, such as excluding the StealthAUDIT database from the scan.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration where the customer attempted to scan too many SQL servers (approximately 640) simultaneously, leading to performance degradation and extended processing times.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer not to scan such a large number of SQL servers at once. Instead, it was recommended to break the scans into smaller groups, which would facilitate easier scanning and reporting. This approach would also help in managing the workload on the system more effectively.

## Notes
- For future reference, it is crucial to avoid scanning a large number of SQL servers simultaneously, especially when they contain a significant amount of data.
- Consider implementing filtering options to exclude unnecessary databases from scans to improve performance and reduce processing time.
