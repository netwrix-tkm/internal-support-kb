## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L83eCIAR
- **Case Number:** 433744
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Axos Bank
- **Contact Name:** Alan A. Moreno
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that SQL_ServerSettings scans were aborting mid-execution without generating logs. The process remained active and required manual termination. Similar issues were noted with sensitive data scans.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using version 11.6.90 of the software.
- The issue was related to scanning multiple SQL hosts simultaneously.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Received procdump and screenshots from the customer.
2. Requested job logs from the customer for further analysis.
3. Reviewed job logs and identified multiple CyberArk password errors.
4. Noted that the integration with CyberArk had changed in versions after 11.6.0.86, requiring reconfiguration if used prior to this version.
5. Investigated the possibility of deadlocks in SQL transactions as indicated by error logs.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a product defect related to scanning multiple SQL hosts at once, which led to deadlocks and other errors during execution.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by applying the hotfix: **Stealthaudit-hotfix-11.6.0.065**. This fix addressed the underlying defect without requiring the customer to reconfigure their SQL jobs.

## Notes
- Customers using CyberArk prior to version 11.6.0.86 may need to reconfigure their integration due to changes in the software.
- It is advisable to monitor for deadlocks when running scans against multiple SQL hosts, as this can lead to similar issues.
- Ensure that customers are aware of the hotfix availability and provide them with the necessary links for future reference.
