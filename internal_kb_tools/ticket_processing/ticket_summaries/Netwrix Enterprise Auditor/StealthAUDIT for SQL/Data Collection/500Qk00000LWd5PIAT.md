- **Case Number:** 434801
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Oak Hill Advisors
- **Contact Name:** Douglas Kupcha
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported various connection issues while attempting to read SQL audit trace files. The specific error messages indicated transport-level errors and execution timeouts, which resulted in the skipping of certain audit files.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a SQL environment monitored by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically using StealthAUDIT for SQL.
- The timeout settings for SQL jobs were initially set to 240 seconds.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided logs indicating the errors encountered during SQL activity runs.
2. The support engineer reviewed the timeout settings and identified that the command timeout was set to 240 seconds.
3. The support engineer suggested increasing the command timeout by modifying the job configuration XML.
4. The customer applied the suggested changes and re-ran the SQL activity jobs.
5. Subsequent scans were monitored to check for improvements in error rates.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient timeout settings for the SQL activity jobs. The default command timeout of 240 seconds was not adequate for the operations being performed, leading to transport-level errors and execution timeouts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Increasing the command timeout setting in the SQL job configuration XML. The support engineer instructed the customer to append a '0' to the existing timeout value, effectively increasing it to 2400 seconds.
- After applying the changes, the customer successfully ran the SQL activity jobs, which resulted in significantly fewer errors and successful scans.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor timeout settings in SQL jobs, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex queries.
- Future users should consider adjusting timeout settings based on the expected duration of SQL operations to prevent similar issues.
- Regular monitoring and adjustments may be necessary as the environment or data volume changes.
