## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C2N3IIAV
- **Case Number:** 412357
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wipro
- **Contact Name:** Baskar Velu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a host mismatch issue while triggering SQL collection scan jobs, where the target host name kept changing.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred in a SQL Server environment managed by Wipro.
- The Netwrix product version in use was 11.6.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial contact was made with the customer to discuss settings related to the SQL job.
2. A meeting was scheduled to review the settings, but the customer requested an engineer in the IST time zone due to scheduling conflicts.
3. The support team requested screenshots of the mismatch for further analysis.
4. The customer provided ping and nslookup results to verify connectivity to the affected server.
5. The support team confirmed that the server was in the Wipro domain and requested further investigation into the FQDN settings.
6. A new Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) was tested during a meeting, which appeared to resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration in the host list settings, specifically related to the use of host names versus FQDNs.

## Solution
The solution involved:
- Rebuilding the host list using FQDNs instead of host names.
- Testing the new configuration during a meeting, which confirmed that the FQDN-based host list worked correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the host target options setting is configured to "use Host name" rather than "prefer DNS name if available" to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always verify connectivity to SQL servers through ping and nslookup to confirm that the correct FQDNs are being used.
- Consider time zone differences when scheduling meetings with customers in different regions to facilitate quicker resolutions.
