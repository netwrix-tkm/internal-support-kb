## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JOXZOIA5
- **Case Number:** 429618
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Oak Hill Advisors
- **Contact Name:** Doug Kupcha
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when executing a SQL Server Logins job, specifically stating: "Error executing query on instance 'PNVAOMSDB.OHPNY.COMMSSQLSERVER' and database 'master'." Initially, it was believed that the issue was related to a size limitation.

## Environment Details
- SQL Server Instance: PNVAOMSDB.OHPNY.COMMSSQLSERVER
- Database: master
- Product Version: 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Increased the size limit value from 50 to 1000 to address the suspected size limitation.
2. Deleted the extended events session related to the job.
3. Ran the script again with the new value to check for successful and unsuccessful login reporting.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not explicitly identified in the case. However, the initial assumption of a size limitation was addressed by changing the configuration value, which did not resolve the error.

## Solution
A new job was created and tested for successful and unsuccessful login reporting. This new job successfully executed without errors, resolving the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure to monitor the SQL Server jobs regularly for any similar errors.
- If similar issues arise, consider reviewing the job configurations and any related extended events sessions.
- Document any changes made to job configurations for future reference.
