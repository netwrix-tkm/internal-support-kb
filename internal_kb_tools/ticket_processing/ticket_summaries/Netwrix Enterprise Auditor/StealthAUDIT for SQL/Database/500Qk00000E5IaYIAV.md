- **Case Number:** 417276
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Kaviya
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SQL
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested clarification on whether it is possible to scan only online databases using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, as some databases on their servers are offline, causing issues with their Network Operations Center (NOC).

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The issue pertains specifically to the StealthAUDIT for SQL component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to use the following SQL query to identify the state of databases:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE state = 0;
   ```
   This query returns only databases that are online (state = 0).
   
2. It was confirmed that while querying a handful of databases interactively is feasible, the customer sought an automated solution for scanning databases.

3. The support team clarified that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) cannot scan only the "Online" databases unless the exact scan scope of the databases is specified to scan their permissions.

4. The team informed the customer that database objects can be filtered out in the Query setting of the SQL_PermissionScan job.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's functionality, which does not allow for automatic scanning of only online databases without specifying the exact scope for permissions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that they can filter database objects in the Query settings of the SQL_PermissionScan job. This allows them to exclude offline databases from the scan, thereby addressing the concerns raised by the NOC.

## Notes
- It is important to note that the current functionality of NEA requires manual specification of the database scope for permission scans.
- Future users should be aware that while interactive queries can help identify online databases, automated scans will need to be configured to exclude offline databases explicitly.
