- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Vistra Corporate Services Co.
- **Contact Name:** Hanif Parupia
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer needed assistance migrating the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) to new 2022 servers.

## Environment Details
- The migration involved upgrading the NEA installation and ensuring compatibility with the new server environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled the NEA migration and ensured it was prioritized alongside StealthINTERCEPT migrations.
2. Completed the migration and verified that the AIC access was functioning correctly.
3. Confirmed that Active Directory Inventory (ADI) scans and File System (FS) scans were operational post-migration.
4. Addressed customer inquiries regarding missing favorites and options in the reports console.
5. Provided documentation on enabling TLS for both web consoles.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to migrate the NEA installation to a new server, which required careful planning and execution to ensure all functionalities were preserved and operational.

## Solution
The migration was successfully completed, and the following actions were taken:
- Verified that the server was operational and that ADI scans were running correctly.
- Upgraded and migrated the AIC console.
- Re-published all reports to the reports console and restored the favorites from a backup of the old server to the new server.

## Notes
- Customers should monitor the environment after migration to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
- It is important to run necessary jobs to generate new reports after migration, as only the AD Inventory was visible initially due to incomplete job execution.
- For future migrations, ensure that all critical components are scheduled and completed in the correct order to avoid operational disruptions.
