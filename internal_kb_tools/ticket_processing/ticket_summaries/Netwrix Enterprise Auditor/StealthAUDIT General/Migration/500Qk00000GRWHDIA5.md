- **Case Number:** 422464
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Chubb INA Holdings Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Karoline Robb
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer successfully migrated files from their NEA Migration folder to a new server and needed to confirm that all necessary components were in place before decommissioning the old server. They required assistance with the StealthAUDIT migration process and subsequent configurations.

## Environment Details
- The customer was migrating from SQL Server 2012 to SQL Server 2019.
- The new server had StealthAUDIT 11.5 installed, and the old configuration was copied over.
- The customer was waiting for a new license to proceed with further upgrades.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Discussed the StealthAUDIT migration process with the client.
2. Confirmed that the following actions were completed by the client:
   - SQL databases were transferred to the new server.
   - Scheduled tasks in StealthAUDIT were disabled.
   - A provided script was run on the SQL server to change the hostname of the application server in the SQL database.
   - NEA 11.5 and AIC installers were downloaded on the new server.
3. Conducted follow-up meetings to ensure all configurations were correct.
4. Assisted the client in modifying and running the SQL script during a meeting due to initial issues.
5. Confirmed that data and jobs were functioning on the new server.

## Root Cause
The delays in the migration process were primarily due to inter-departmental issues on the client's end, which affected the timely execution of necessary tasks and configurations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Successfully installing StealthAUDIT 11.5 on the new server and copying over the old configuration.
- Ensuring the CyberArk integration was configured to change the scheduled account.
- Confirming that the migration was complete and that all data and jobs were operational on the new server.

## Notes
- The client expressed a desire to hold off on installing the Access Information Center (AIC) until they upgraded to version 11.6 to avoid installing IIS for the older version.
- A follow-up ticket was created to address issues with scheduled jobs that were failing to start after the migration.
- The client was using an intermediate license and needed to obtain a new license before proceeding with further upgrades.
