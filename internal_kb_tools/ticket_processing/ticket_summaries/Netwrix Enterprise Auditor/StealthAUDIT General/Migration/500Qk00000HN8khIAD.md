- **Account/Company:** Investec SA
- **Contact Name:** Emmanuel Mvubu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when opening the STEALTHAUDIT application, stating: "Cannot resolve the collation conflict between 'SQL_Latin_General_CP1_CI_AS' and 'Latin_General_CI_AS' in the equal to operation."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.0
- The issue arose during a migration process, which the client performed without consulting their DBA.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message for collation conflict details.
2. Investigated the database collation settings to identify discrepancies.
3. Suggested the customer consult relevant documentation regarding collation settings.
4. Provided a link to a Microsoft article explaining how to set or change the database collation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a collation conflict between two different SQL collation settings: "SQL_Latin_General_CP1_CI_AS" and "Latin_General_CI_AS." This conflict typically arises when database objects with different collations are compared or joined in SQL operations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to the Microsoft documentation that explains how to set or change the database collation. The customer was advised to ensure that all database objects involved in the migration have compatible collation settings to avoid such conflicts in the future.

## Notes
- It is crucial for clients to consult their DBA before performing migrations to prevent configuration issues like collation conflicts.
- Future migrations should include a review of collation settings to ensure compatibility across all database objects involved.
