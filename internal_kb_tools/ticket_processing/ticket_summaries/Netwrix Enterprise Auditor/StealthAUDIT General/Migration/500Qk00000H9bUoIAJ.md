## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H9bUoIAJ
- **Case Number:** 424237
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liberty Bank
- **Contact Name:** Ziyaad Rasool
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error after migrating their database to a new server with the same settings. The error occurred when attempting to run jobs and launch the application, indicating a collation conflict.

## Environment Details
- **Database Collation on Source Server:** Latin1_General_CI_AS
- **Database Collation on Target Server:** SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
- **Application Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the database collation settings on both the source and target servers.
2. Reviewed the error messages generated during job execution and application launch.
3. Attempted to run SQL scripts that triggered the collation conflict.
4. Checked for any stored procedures that could not be found, specifically `#SA_ImportObject`.
5. Provided explanations and possible solutions to the customer regarding collation settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a discrepancy between the collation settings of the target server and the migrated database. The source database used "Latin1_General_CI_AS" collation, while the target server was set to "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS", leading to conflicts during SQL operations.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the customer was advised to align the collation settings of the target server with those of the source database. This involved:
- Changing the collation of the target database to match "Latin1_General_CI_AS".
- Re-running the jobs and launching the application, which successfully resolved the collation conflict.

## Notes
- Ensure that the database collation settings are consistent between source and target servers during migration to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to document collation settings before migration and verify them post-migration to prevent conflicts.
