- **Case Number:** 439216
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Beacon Roofing
- **Contact Name:** Tony Do
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, Beacon Roofing, requested assistance with migrating from StealthAudit to Enterprise Auditor. The migration involved moving from a Windows Server 2012 to a new Windows Server 2022.

## Environment Details
- **Current Server:** Windows Server 2012
- **Target Server:** Windows Server 2022
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Discussed the migration process and the need for a pre-flight process.
2. Scheduled a meeting to perform the pre-flight process.
3. Collected necessary backups and screenshots of global settings and custom job settings.
4. Confirmed that the SQL server/database would remain unchanged.
5. Performed the pre-flight process, which included:
   - Backing up the Jobs folder and other critical files.
   - Ensuring the installation media for StealthAudit was available.
   - Verifying that no scheduled jobs were running before the migration.

## Root Cause
The migration was necessitated by the use of an unsupported Windows Server 2012, which required an upgrade to a newer server version.

## Solution
The migration was successfully completed by following these steps:
- Obtained the installation media for StealthAudit.
- Backed up the following files and folders from the StealthAUDIT directory:
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Jobs`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\StealthAUDIT.LIC`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports`
  - Additional critical configuration files and folders as listed in the original case.
- Restored the SQL database on the new server and ran the necessary SQL scripts to migrate host data.
- Verified that the installer for the new version was downloaded and unblocked.

## Notes
- Ensure that all backups are completed before initiating the migration process.
- Always verify that the installation media is accessible and that the installer is unblocked to avoid issues during installation.
- It is advisable to document all global settings and custom job settings prior to migration for reference.
