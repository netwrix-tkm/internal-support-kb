- **Feature:** Migration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with migrating Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.6 to a new set of Windows Server 2022 machines. During the migration, they encountered certificate errors on jobs using the file system proxy, which is dedicated to scanning sensitive data on NetApp.

## Environment Details
- Original environment: Windows Server 2022 (in-place OS upgrade)
- New environment: Fresh build of Windows Server 2022
- NEA version: 11.6
- Previous version: StealthAudit 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the occurrence of certificate errors on jobs using the file system proxy.
2. Investigated whether the errors were related to the in-place OS upgrade or the upgrade from StealthAudit 11.5 to NEA 11.6.
3. Coordinated with the customer’s DBA to run an SQL script to update the server name in the database.
4. Installed Netwrix Enterprise Auditor on the new server and migrated data from the old server.
5. Installed the proxy and Sensitive Data Add-on on the new proxy server.
6. Launched the application and updated the host list with the new proxy server.
7. Installed the Access Information Center (AIC).
8. Manually recreated job schedules after the imported schedules failed to work.
9. Verified the service account's communication with the new proxy and rescanned the file system.
10. Addressed errors in Netwrix Analyzer by fixing job configurations and validating job functionality on the new server.
11. Created a separate ticket to resolve Activity Monitor errors related to NetApp connectivity.
12. Uploaded log files for further analysis and scheduled follow-up meetings to address remaining issues before moving to production.

## Root Cause
The migration issues were caused by complications stemming from the in-place OS upgrade, which necessitated a move from the old Windows Server 2022 environment to a new build of Windows Server 2022.

## Solution
1. Installed Netwrix Enterprise Auditor on the new server and migrated data from the old server.
2. Installed the proxy and Sensitive Data Add-on on the new proxy server.
3. Coordinated with the customer’s DBA to run an SQL script to update the server name in the database.
4. Launched the application, updated the host list with the new proxy server, and installed the Access Information Center (AIC).
5. Manually recreated job schedules after the imported schedules failed to work.
6. Verified the service account's communication with the new proxy and rescanned the file system.
7. Addressed errors in Netwrix Analyzer by fixing job configurations and validating job functionality on the new server.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future migrations are conducted on a fresh build of the operating system to avoid complications from in-place upgrades.
- Always verify the service account's communication with the proxy server after migration.
- Consider creating a checklist for job configurations and schedules to streamline the migration process.
