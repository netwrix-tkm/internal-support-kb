## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K97GTIAZ
- **Case Number:** 431040
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nexidia
- **Contact Name:** Angie Sawyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Health Check Request
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that previous administrators of StealthAudit had created numerous SQL tables that are no longer in use. They sought guidance on the best method to remove these obsolete tables. Additionally, they noticed domains listed in Settings > Connections that they believed should not be there and were unsure how to remove them.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** MS SQL Server
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Backup Guidelines:** Provided detailed steps for backing up the StealthAudit database using MS SQL Server Management Studio, including disabling relevant services and ensuring no jobs were running during the backup.
2. **SQL Queries:** Executed SQL queries to identify and drop unnecessary tables, specifically those prefixed with 'SA_' and those created in specific years (e.g., 2011, 2012).
3. **Domain Cleanup:** Referenced documentation on removing domain audit data from reports and dropping domains.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the accumulation of unused SQL tables created by previous administrators, leading to clutter in the database and potential confusion regarding active connections.

## Solution
1. **Table Cleanup:** The customer was guided to use SQL queries to create a backup of the `SA_Messages` table, retaining only relevant records from 2024 onward. The steps included:
   - Creating a backup table (`SA_Messages_BAK`).
   - Dropping the original `SA_Messages` table.
   - Renaming the backup table to `SA_Messages`.
   
   Example SQL commands provided:
   ```sql
   SELECT * INTO StealthAudit.[dbo].[SA_Messages_BAK] FROM StealthAudit.[dbo].[SA_Messages] WHERE JobRunTimeKey >= '2024-01-01';
   DROP TABLE StealthAudit.[dbo].[SA_Messages];
   EXEC sp_rename 'SA_Messages_BAK', 'SA_Messages';
   ```

2. **Domain Removal:** The customer was directed to the Netwrix help center for guidance on removing unwanted domains from the database.

## Notes
- It is crucial to perform a backup of the database before making any deletions to prevent data loss.
- Future administrators should regularly review and clean up unused tables to maintain database performance and clarity.
- Ensure that all relevant services are disabled during backup operations to avoid conflicts.
