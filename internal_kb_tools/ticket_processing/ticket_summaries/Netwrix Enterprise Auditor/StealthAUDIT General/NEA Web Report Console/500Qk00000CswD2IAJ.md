- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** FAB Misr
- **Contact Name:** Ahmed Shaban
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** Secure Web Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, FABMISR, reported an issue when attempting to secure the web interface of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, receiving a "refused to connect" error.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a system running Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The web server service was suspected to be running under an account with insufficient permissions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the account running the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service, which was found to be "Network Service".
2. Suggested changing the service account to either LOCAL SYSTEM or a service account with sufficient permissions to access the NEA SQL Server database.
3. Checked logs for errors related to the HTTPS connection.
4. Identified an error indicating a conflict on port 8082:
   ```
   System.Net.HttpListenerException (0x80004005): Failed to listen on prefix 'https://+:8082/' because it conflicts with an existing registration on the machine.
   ```
5. Executed the command to retrieve all reserved URLs:
   ```cmd
   netsh http show urlacl
   ```
6. Identified the conflicting URL using port 8082 and executed the command to delete the conflicting URL:
   ```cmd
   netsh http delete urlacl url=<value of "Reserved URL">
   ```
7. Verified the SSL certificate binding to port 8082 using:
   ```cmd
   netsh http show sslcert
   ```
8. Provided the customer with a link to the relevant documentation for securing web reports.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was a conflict on port 8082, where another application was already registered to listen on that port, preventing the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor from establishing a secure connection.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Deleting the conflicting URL reservation on port 8082 using the `netsh` command.
2. Ensuring that the SSL certificate was correctly bound to the NEA Web Service port (8082).
3. Confirming that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service was running under an appropriate account with sufficient permissions.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service runs under a service account with adequate permissions to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for port conflicts on the server to prevent service interruptions.
- Refer to the Netwrix documentation for securing web reports for detailed guidance on configuration.
