- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Lewis Group Ltd

- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** NEA Published Reports
- **Version:** 11.6.0.137

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue accessing the NEA Published Reports. Upon login, they encountered an error message stating, “Request for Downloading published reports Failed: Internal Server Error.” The logs indicated a problem with user authentication, specifically stating, “The user name or password is incorrect,” despite the credentials being valid for other tasks.

## Environment Details
- NEA Build Number: 11.6.0.137
- Previous NEA Versions: 11.6.0.122 and 11.6.0.38
- No Role-Based Access (RBA) was set up for the console or reports.
- No certificates assigned to the Published Reports Web Server.
- Access to the Access Information Center (AIC) was functioning correctly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the username and password were correct and functional for other tasks.
2. Checked the NEA settings for any configured roles under NEA > Settings > Access.
3. Tested login with a Windows user account that had no roles configured.
4. Attempted to run the NEA Web Server using the Local System account.
5. Reviewed the service logs for errors related to authentication.
6. Explored the possibility of permissions issues with the RBAC files.
7. Suggested recreating the reports folder to check for corruption.
8. Gathered additional logs and screenshots as requested by support engineers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a permissions problem related to the user accounts accessing the NEA Published Reports. The original account used for login did not have the necessary permissions, which led to the authentication error.

## Solution
The customer created a new user account with the appropriate permissions and roles configured. After setting up the new account, they were able to log in successfully and access the NEA Published Reports without encountering the internal server error.

## Notes
- Ensure that any user accounts intended to access the NEA Published Reports have the necessary roles assigned, particularly the Report Viewer role.
- It is advisable to verify permissions and roles after any changes to the user accounts or configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist, consider checking the service account running the NEA Web Server for adequate permissions to the database and other resources.
