## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a 503 error when attempting to access the Access tab in the reporting website page of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on AIC version 11.5.
- The installation was performed on the D: drive in the "wwwrootinetpub" directory.
- The application was configured to use the following ports:
  - HTTP: 81
  - HTTPS: 8082

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Uninstalled AIC 11.5 through Control Panel (or appwiz.cpl).
2. Reinstalled AIC on the D: drive into the "wwwrootinetpub" directory.
3. Configured AIC to run on HTTP port 81 and HTTPS port 8082.
4. Verified access to the Access tab after reinstallation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the 503 error was not explicitly identified in the case documentation. However, it is implied that the initial installation may have been misconfigured or corrupted, leading to the error when accessing the Access tab.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by uninstalling the existing AIC 11.5 installation and performing a clean installation on the D: drive in the correct directory. After reinstalling, the application was successfully accessed on the specified ports, allowing the customer to reach the Access tab without encountering the 503 error.

## Notes
- It is recommended to review the installation documentation for AIC 11.5 to ensure proper configuration during installation.
- Future installations should be monitored for similar issues, and if a 503 error occurs, consider performing a clean uninstall and reinstall as a first troubleshooting step.
