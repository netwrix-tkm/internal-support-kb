# Ticket Summary

## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I1WmfIAF
- **Case Number:** 426441
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baldwin Risk Partners
- **Contact Name:** Ryan Oleary
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** Reporting
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where users could log in to the Published Reports but received a 500 error after logging in, preventing them from viewing the reports. This issue arose during attempts to resolve a prior ticket related to migrating SMB shares.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Build Number:** 86

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide details about the impact of the issue on their business, affected users, and any troubleshooting steps already taken.
2. The customer was instructed to enable debug logging in the NEA Console and rerun the jobs to collect detailed logs.
3. The support team reviewed the job configurations and logs to identify any misconfigurations or errors.
4. A meeting was scheduled to discuss the report creation and further troubleshooting steps.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration related to audit settings. Specifically, the NEA service account used for the AIC did not have the necessary permissions to access the reports.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the NEA service account was added to the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group, which grants read access to all users and groups in the domain. This adjustment allowed the service account to properly access the reports, eliminating the 500 error.

## Notes
- Ensure that service accounts have the appropriate permissions and group memberships to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review audit settings and permissions for service accounts used in reporting and data collection tasks.
