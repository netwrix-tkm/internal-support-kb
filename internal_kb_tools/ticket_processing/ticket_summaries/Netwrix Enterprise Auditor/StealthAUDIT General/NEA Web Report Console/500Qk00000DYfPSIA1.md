- **Case Number:** 416150
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank
- **Contact Name:** Jennifer White
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** Reporting Site Access
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, they lost access to the reporting site that was previously accessible on port 8082.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Age:** 10.9

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the status of the reporting site on port 8082.
2. Checked service configurations related to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
3. Reviewed service account settings to ensure proper permissions.
4. Identified that the service was running under the Local System account instead of the designated service account.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the service's "Log On As" setting being configured to Local System instead of the appropriate service account used for the AIC (Auditing and Information Collection).

## Solution
The resolution involved changing the service's "Log On As" setting to match the service account that is used for the AIC. This adjustment restored access to the reporting site.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly verify service account configurations after updates to prevent similar access issues.
- If issues persist, consider deleting the old URACL and rebuilding it as a potential troubleshooting step.
