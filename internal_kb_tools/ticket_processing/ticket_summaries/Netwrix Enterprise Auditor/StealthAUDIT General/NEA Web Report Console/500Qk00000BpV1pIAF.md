## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BpV1pIAF
- **Case Number:** 411935
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Thales Group Australia
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Heaton-Harris
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** SSO for Published Reports and AIC
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's Published Reports and Access Information Center, specifically that users were prompted for Active Directory (AD) credentials each time they attempted to log in.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Issue Type:** Incorrect configuration: target server software

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of Windows Authentication for Published Reports and AIC.
2. Attempted to resolve the issue by adding the computer service account to the database.
3. Executed the command:
   ```bash
   Setspn –S HTTP/[FQDN] [domain][servername]$
   ```
   and variations using both FQDN and NETBIOS names.
4. Restarted the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service.
5. Communicated with the customer to gather additional information and schedule follow-up meetings.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a known problem with version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which required users to provide credentials for each login due to improper configuration of the Service Principal Name (SPN) for the web service running under a local system account.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully adding the computer service account to the database, which allowed the SSO configuration to function correctly without prompting for credentials. The following command was executed to register the SPN:
```bash
Setspn –S HTTP/[FQDN] [domain][servername]$
```
After executing this command, the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service was restarted, and the customer was able to log in without being prompted for credentials.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SPN is correctly configured for any future installations or updates of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- It is recommended to check the service account permissions and ensure that the web service is running under an appropriate account to avoid similar issues.
- For any future cases involving SSO issues, verify the version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and check for known issues related to that version.
