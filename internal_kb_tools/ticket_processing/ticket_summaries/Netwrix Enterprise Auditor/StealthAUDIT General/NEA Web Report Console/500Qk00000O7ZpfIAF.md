- **Case Number:** 442294
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Fidelity Bank Nigeria
- **Contact Name:** Antonie Olivier
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** SSL Certificate Management
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an SSL certificate issue when accessing published reports in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, resulting in warnings and connection failures.

## Environment Details
- The issue was suspected to be related to the SSL certificate binding to the default port (8082).
- The environment may have restrictions or configurations that block the default port.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified SSL settings and tested the connection.
2. Attempted to re-bind the SSL certificate to port 8082.
3. Checked the listening port list to confirm if port 8082 was active.
4. Noted that port 8082 was not showing up, indicating a potential blockage.
5. Suggested using a random high port (45565) as an alternative.
6. Re-bound the SSL certificate to port 45565 and tested the connection.

## Root Cause
The SSL certificate was not properly bound to the default port (8082), which was likely blocked by environmental settings or firewall rules, preventing successful SSL connections.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by re-binding the SSL certificate to a different port (45565). After this change, the SSL connection for the Web Console was successfully established without any further issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that any firewall or network settings allow traffic on the chosen port to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Document any changes made to SSL configurations for future reference and troubleshooting.
- Consider using high random ports for SSL bindings if default ports are blocked in the environment.
