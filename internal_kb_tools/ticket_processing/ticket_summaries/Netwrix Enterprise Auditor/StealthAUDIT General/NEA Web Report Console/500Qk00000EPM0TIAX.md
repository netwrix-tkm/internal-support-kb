## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000EPM0TIAX
- **Case Number:** 418047
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CRH Americas Materials
- **Contact Name:** Frank Babcock
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that published reports were not accessible, as the server was not listening on the expected port (8082). The URL configured for report publishing was confirmed to be `http://:8082`.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the URL configuration for report publishing in Auditor settings.
2. Conducted a `netstat` command to check if the server was listening on port 8082.
3. Attempted to toggle the published reports setting off and on.
4. Restarted the Netwrix services.
5. Restarted the server itself.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration where the customer was using port 443 for the published reports instead of the specified port 8082. Additionally, there was an expired certificate on port 443.

## Solution
The resolution involved the following steps:
1. Bound the valid certificate from the AIC (481) to port 443 to ensure it applied to the Published Reports.
2. Restarted the Netwrix Web Server service.
3. After these changes, access to the published reports was restored, and both the reports and the web console were functioning correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct port is configured for published reports in future cases.
- Regularly check and renew certificates to avoid service interruptions.
- Document any changes made to configurations for future reference.
