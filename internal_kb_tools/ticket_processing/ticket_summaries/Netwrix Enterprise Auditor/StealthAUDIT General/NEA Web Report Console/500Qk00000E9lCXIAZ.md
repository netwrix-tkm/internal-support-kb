## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E9lCXIAZ
- **Case Number:** 417510
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Pronto
- **Contact Name:** Jason Kidd
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Sensitive Data Job fails to run successfully, displaying an error message: "Unexpected exception: Error while publishing report. Exiting with message: Sequence contains more than one matching element."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Windows Server
- **Product Version:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reinstalled Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 on the Windows Server.
2. Attempted to run the Sensitive Data Solution report again, which resulted in the same error.
3. Navigated to the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports`.
4. Made a backup copy of the `Reports.xml` file.
5. Opened the `Reports.xml` file and deleted all reports between the `<Reports>` tags, leaving it blank for missing reports.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. However, the error message indicated a conflict with multiple matching elements in the report generation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the `Reports.xml` file:
- After backing up the original file, all reports between the `<Reports>` tags were deleted, which allowed the Sensitive Data Job to run successfully without encountering the previous error.

## Notes
- It is advisable to always back up configuration files like `Reports.xml` before making any modifications.
- Future users encountering similar issues should consider checking for duplicate entries or conflicts in the report configuration.
