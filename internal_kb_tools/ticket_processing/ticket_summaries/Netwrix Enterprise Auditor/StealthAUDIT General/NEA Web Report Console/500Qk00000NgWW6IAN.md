- **Case Number:** 440969
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- **Contact Name:** Craig Tinkler
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** Web Interface
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
After upgrading from version 11.5 to 12.0 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the web interface was not functioning. The web server appeared to be down, with services running but connections being refused. A netstat command showed no listener on port 8082.

## Environment Details
- Upgraded from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5 to 12.0.
- The web service was initially configured to run as Local System.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the web server services were running.
2. Ran `netstat -aob` to check for listeners on port 8082, which returned no active listeners.
3. Reviewed the configuration settings of the web service.
4. Rebooted the server to see if it would resolve the issue.
5. Suggested enabling debug logging and collecting logs from various locations for further analysis.
6. Considered potential certificate issues based on the symptoms described.

## Root Cause
The web service was configured to run as Local System, which did not have the necessary permissions to access the database. This configuration was likely set by the installer during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the web service configuration to run as a dedicated user account that had the appropriate access to the database. This adjustment allowed the web service to function correctly and accept connections.

## Notes
- It is recommended to include a note in the upgrade guide to verify that the web service runs as a user with database access, rather than as Local System, to prevent similar issues in future upgrades.
- Ensure that all relevant logs are collected and reviewed when troubleshooting web service issues after an upgrade.
