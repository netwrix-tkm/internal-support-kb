- **Case Number:** 416263
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Regions Bank
- **Contact Name:** Jim Callison
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer was unable to configure web-based reports on their local machine, using either the machine name, localhost, or a certificate set in the reporting settings. They were specifically looking to secure the Published Reports site.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to use the certificate friendly name as the URL instead of the NEA host machine name.
2. Bound the certificate to port 8082.
3. Adjusted the `%SAInstallDir%WebWebServer.exe.config` file's `BindingURL` parameter to `https://+:8082`.
4. Restarted the Netwrix Web Server Service.
5. Used the certificate to bind the Access Information Center securely to port 443 by modifying the `AccessInformationCenter.service.exe.config` file and restarting the Netwrix Access Information Center service.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration where the customer was trying to use the certificate's friendly name as the URL instead of the actual NEA host machine name.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Binding the certificate to port 8082.
2. Updating the `BindingURL` parameter in the `WebWebServer.exe.config` file to `https://+:8082`.
3. Restarting the Netwrix Web Server Service.
4. Additionally, binding the certificate to port 443 for the Access Information Center by modifying the `AccessInformationCenter.service.exe.config` file and restarting the corresponding service.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct host machine name is used in configurations to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the binding ports and configuration files after making changes to ensure services are correctly secured and accessible.
