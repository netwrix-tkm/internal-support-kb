## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LOI1JIAX
- **Case Number:** 434404
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IBM - Etihad Airways
- **Contact Name:** Praveen Huilgol
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues accessing the Access Information Center (AIC) console, encountering an IIS error. Restarting the IIS service did not resolve the issue.

## Environment Details
- **IIS Version:** In use
- **Netwrix Version:** 11.5
- **Configuration:** IIS configured on the StealthAudit server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked the IIS configuration on the StealthAudit server.
2. Identified an old binding for port 8443 configured for the Default Web Site.
3. Removed the old binding due to it being associated with an expired certificate.
4. Added a new certificate binding for port 8443 specifically for the StealthAudit AIC site using the latest certificate.
5. Updated the `WebServer.exe.config` file within the Web folder of the StealthAUDIT installation directory with the following values:
   ```xml
   <add key="AdditionalContentTabs" value="Access Information Center, https://+:/V2/Login?embed"/>
   <add key="BindingUrl" value="https://+:8443"/>
   ```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect IIS configuration, specifically an old binding for port 8443 that was associated with an expired certificate. This prevented proper access to the AIC console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the old binding for port 8443.
- Adding a new binding with the latest certificate for the StealthAudit AIC site.
- Updating the `WebServer.exe.config` file to ensure proper configuration for accessing the AIC.

After these changes, access to the AIC over the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the StealthAudit server using port 8443 was successful, and certificate validation was confirmed.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly check and update IIS bindings and certificates to prevent similar issues in the future.
