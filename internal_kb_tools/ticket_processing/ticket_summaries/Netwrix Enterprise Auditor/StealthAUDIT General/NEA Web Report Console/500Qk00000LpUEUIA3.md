- **Account/Company:** Baker & McKenzie Global Services LLC
- **Contact Name:** Don Boncodin
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer was configuring the web admin console of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to use HTTPS and needed clarification on the web server architecture used by the NEA Reporting console to generate SSL certificates.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.72
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer inquired about the web server used by the NEA Reporting console (e.g., Apache or Tomcat) to generate SSL certificates.
2. The support team confirmed that the reporting module uses MS HTTPAPI for servicing web requests.
3. It was clarified that there is minimal difference in SSL certificate generation as long as the server supports SSL.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of knowledge regarding the web server architecture utilized by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's reporting module, which was necessary for generating SSL certificates.

## Solution
The support team provided the following information:
- The NEA Reporting console operates on MS HTTPAPI, not Apache or Tomcat.
- The customer was informed that SSL certificates can be generated as long as the server supports SSL, regardless of the specific server technology.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the web server architecture when configuring HTTPS for the NEA Reporting console.
- It is important to communicate that SSL certificate generation is generally flexible as long as the server supports SSL.
