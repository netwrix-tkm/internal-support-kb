- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Valvoline (formerly Ashland on behalf of Valvoline)
- **Contact Name:** Lamare Adams
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Web Report Console
- **Feature:** NEA Published Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were unable to access the NEA Published Reports, receiving a 500 error when attempting to run reports. This issue was critical as they needed the Active Directory user account information for license renewal.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) environment.
- The user account configured to run the "Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server" service was suspected to be misconfigured.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reset the password for the user configured to run the "Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server" service in "Services.msc".
2. Verified that the user had the "Report Viewer" role assigned in NEA > Settings > Access.
3. Checked if the user was configured correctly in the SA/NEA database.
4. Reviewed the configuration of the SA AIC (Access Information Center) service to ensure it matched the SA Web Server service.
5. Suggested testing with different user accounts to confirm access issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration of the user account settings for the service running the NEA Web Server. Specifically, the password for the service account was incorrect, preventing proper authentication and access to the reports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Resetting the password for the user configured to run the "Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server" service.
2. Ensuring that the user had the appropriate role ("Report Viewer") assigned in the NEA settings.
3. Confirming that the same Windows Authentication account was used for both the SA AIC and the SA Web Server service.

After these changes, the customer was able to log into the NEA Published Reports successfully and access the required reports.

## Notes
- Ensure that the service account used for the NEA Web Server service is correctly configured and that the password is updated whenever changes are made.
- Users must have the appropriate roles assigned in NEA to access published reports.
- For future reference, if access issues arise, verify both the service account configuration and user role assignments in the NEA settings.
