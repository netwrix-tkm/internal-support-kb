## Problem Description
The customer, Beth Martin, reported that after renewing their Netwrix certificate through their certificate manager, they were unsure how to bind the new certificate in IIS.

The urgency was heightened as the certificate was set to expire in two days.

2. Provided guidance on how to add a new certificate for the StealthAUDIT web reports port.
3. Suggested checking the default log locations for any potential issues:
   - Enterprise Auditor Console: `%SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication`
   - Access Information Center (11.6): `C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center`
   - Access Information (11.5): `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\StealthAUDIT Compliance`
4. Directed the customer to relevant online articles for additional context.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of familiarity with the process of binding a newly renewed certificate in IIS, compounded by the urgency of the certificate expiration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed instructions on how to bind the new certificate in IIS. The specific guidance included steps to add the new certificate for the StealthAUDIT web reports port, which was documented in the Netwrix help center.

- It is important for customers to be aware of the binding process for certificates in IIS, especially when dealing with renewals close to expiration.
- Future customers should be directed to the Netwrix help center for comprehensive guides on certificate management and binding procedures.
- Always verify the log file locations as they may vary based on the customer's specific environment setup.
