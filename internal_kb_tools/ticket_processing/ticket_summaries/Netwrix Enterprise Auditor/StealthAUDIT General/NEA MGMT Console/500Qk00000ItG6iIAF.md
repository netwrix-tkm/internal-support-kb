## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ItG6iIAF
- **Case Number:** 428426
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** St Margarets Hospice
- **Contact Name:** Liam Rice
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported two vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-1938 and CVE-2019-0232) flagged by Windows Defender on their StealthAUDIT server, specifically related to the `tomcat-juli.jar` file. They inquired whether this file is still used by the Enterprise Auditor and if it can be safely removed.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** 11.6
- **File Path of Concern:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Actions\Survey\Tomcat\bin\tomcat-juli.jar`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the presence of the `tomcat-juli.jar` file in a new installation of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
2. Reviewed the vulnerabilities associated with the `tomcat-juli.jar` file:
   - CVE-2019-0232L: Remote Code Execution on Windows (not a threat due to lack of CGI components).
   - CVE-2020-1938: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution.
3. Checked the Tomcat configuration file located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Actions\Survey\Tomcat\conf\server.xml` to confirm the status of the AJP connector.
4. Confirmed that the AJP connector protocol was commented out, indicating it was disabled.

## Root Cause
The vulnerabilities reported were related to the AJP connector in Apache Tomcat. However, the configuration in the customer's installation had the AJP connector disabled, which mitigated the risk associated with these vulnerabilities.

## Solution
The support team informed the customer that:
- The CVE-2019-0232L vulnerability does not pose a threat as the product does not utilize CGI components.
- The CVE-2020-1938 vulnerability is mitigated by the disabled AJP connector in the configuration file.
- The customer can continue using the `tomcat-juli.jar` file without concern, as both vulnerabilities are addressed in the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review and update configurations to ensure that any potentially vulnerable components are disabled.
- Customers should be informed about the status of vulnerabilities and the measures taken in the product to mitigate risks.
- Always verify the configuration files after updates or installations to ensure that security settings are appropriately applied.
