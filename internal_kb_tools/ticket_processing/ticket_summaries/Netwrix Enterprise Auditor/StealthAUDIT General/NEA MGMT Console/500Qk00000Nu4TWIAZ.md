## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Nu4TWIAZ
- **Case Number:** 441574
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** John Deere Company
- **Contact Name:** Scott Prigge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Feature:** Host Management
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in determining the list of Host Groups that a specific Host is a member of. They needed this information to assess the context of a Host that had been transferred to them without historical context.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Relevant Host Name:** MCANDON-FS

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was directed to the Netwrix Help Center documentation regarding Host Management.
2. Clarification was sought regarding whether the customer was referring to Host Lists.
3. SQL queries were provided to the customer to extract the required information from the database:
   - 
   ```sql
   DECLARE @Server NVARCHAR(50) = 'MCANDON-FS';
   SELECT Name from HostListsTbl where listID in (
       SELECT listID FROM HostListsContentTbl where hostID = (
           SELECT hostID FROM SA_HostMasterTbl where Name = @Server));
   ```
4. A second SQL query was provided to retrieve the Host Group membership:
   - 
   ```sql
   SELECT hmt.name as Host_Name, hlt.name as list_name
   FROM HostListsContentTbl hlct
   JOIN HostListsTbl hlt ON hlt.listID = hlct.listID
   JOIN SA_HostMasterTbl hmt ON hmt.hostID = hlct.hostID
   ORDER BY hmt.name, hlt.name;
   ```

## Root Cause
The customer was unable to find a straightforward method in the UI to determine Host Group membership for a specific Host, necessitating the use of SQL queries to extract this information from the database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with SQL queries that they could run against their database to obtain the list of Host Groups associated with the specified Host. The customer confirmed that the queries returned the necessary information.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the limitations of the UI in retrieving detailed Host Group membership information.
- It may be beneficial to create a Knowledge Base article that outlines how to use SQL queries for similar requests in the future.
