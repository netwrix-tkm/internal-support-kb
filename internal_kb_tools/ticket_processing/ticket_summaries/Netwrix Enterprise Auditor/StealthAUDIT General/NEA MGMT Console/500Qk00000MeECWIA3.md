- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SpecialtyCare

- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General

## Problem Description
The customer reported a UI pop-up error in StealthAUDIT (SA) when navigating the job nodes, specifically stating: "hexadecimal value 0x00, is an invalid character. Line 1."

## Environment Details
- The application version in use was Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA), formerly known as StealthAUDIT, version 11.5.0.240.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the error message was related to the Web UI not loading due to the invalid character.
2. Suggested checking the `PublishedReports.xml` file for corruption by attempting to open it in a web browser.
3. Renamed the original Reports Folder located at `D:\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports` by appending `_03132025` to the folder name.
4. Closed and reopened the StealthAUDIT Console to trigger a rebuild of the Reports Folder.
5. Re-published the reports under the Active Directory Inventory Job Group.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a corruption in the `PublishedReports.xml` file, which contained an invalid character (hexadecimal value 0x00) that prevented the Web UI from loading correctly.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
- The corrupted Reports Folder was renamed to allow for a fresh rebuild.
- The StealthAUDIT Console was closed and reopened to rebuild the Reports Folder.
- Reports were re-published under the Active Directory Inventory Job Group, which restored the functionality of the UI.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the integrity of the `PublishedReports.xml` file to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If the problem recurs, consider upgrading to the latest version of the software, as UI bugs may have been addressed in subsequent releases.
- The ticket can be reopened within 30 days if related issues arise after closure.
