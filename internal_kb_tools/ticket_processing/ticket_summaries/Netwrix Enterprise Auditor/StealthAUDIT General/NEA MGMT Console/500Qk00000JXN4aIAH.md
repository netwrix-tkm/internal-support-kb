## Problem Description
The customer reported encountering a "Root element is missing" error when attempting to access Job properties or configuration settings within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console.

## Environment Details
- **Build Version:** 11.5.1349.1101
- **Affected Folder:** F:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message in the console when accessing Job settings.
2. Checked the SADatabase logs for error details, which indicated a failure to update files/folders due to a corrupted XML file.
3. Attempted to collect additional logs from the SADatabase folder for further analysis.
4. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to gather necessary information for troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The "Root element is missing" error was caused by a corrupted XML file located in the Reports folder of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor installation. This corruption prevented the application from properly loading the necessary configuration settings.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Closed the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console if it was running.
2. Located the corrupted Reports folder at `F:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Reports`.
3. Renamed the folder to "Reports_old" to prevent the application from accessing the corrupted files.
4. Restarted the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console, which automatically recreated the Reports folder.
5. Verified that the error no longer appeared when navigating to Job settings.

## Notes
- Ensure regular backups of configuration files to prevent data loss due to corruption.
- Monitor the application logs for similar errors in the future to proactively address potential issues.
- The customer had additional questions regarding application system requirements after the issue was resolved.
