## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IDcOZIA1
- **Case Number:** 426835
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Tay Caliguiri
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Feature:** RBA (Role-Based Access) Management
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
Users assigned low access level roles, such as "Job Viewer," were able to escalate their permissions within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) console. Despite the Settings dropdown being restricted, users could bypass these restrictions by selecting the top-level Settings option, allowing them to change their roles and other settings.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set up Role-Based Access (RBA) and assign a user a low access level role (e.g., Job Viewer).
2. Log in to the NEA console as the user.
3. Select Settings from the left-hand pane.
4. In the right-hand page, select any option not available in the dropdown under Settings.
5. In the access tab, verify that the user can escalate their permissions to any role except Admin.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect that allowed users to bypass the intended restrictions on role escalation within the NEA console.

## Solution
The issue was resolved in version 11.6.0.46 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. A fix was developed and scheduled for release in the next available cumulative update.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor user permissions closely, especially for roles with low access levels, until the fix is applied.
- Users should be educated on the limitations of their roles and the importance of adhering to access controls.
- Future updates should be reviewed to ensure that similar vulnerabilities do not arise.
