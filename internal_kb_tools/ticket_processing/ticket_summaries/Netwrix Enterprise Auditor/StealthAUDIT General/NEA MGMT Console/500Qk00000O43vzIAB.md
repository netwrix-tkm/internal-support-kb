## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O43vzIAB
- **Case Number:** 442050
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MANCOSA
- **Contact Name:** Ziyaad Rasool
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer
- **Component:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Version:** 11.6.0.132

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the installation directory of the Netwrix Access Analyzer was being filled up with files named *_Extractor_*, which were consuming significant disk space (approximately 90 GB each). The customer inquired about the nature of these files and whether they could be deleted.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) version 11.6.0.132.
- The Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) module was configured to scan a large file server and SharePoint Online.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the issue with the customer regarding the size and nature of the *_Extractor_* files.
2. Requested additional information about the size of the scanned environment.
3. Suggested that the log files could be safely deleted to free up space.
4. Lowered the logging level from Debug to Warning in the Netwrix Access Analyzer settings.
5. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to discuss the configuration of the SDD jobs.
6. Analyzed the results of the SDD job, which included:
   - Folder Count: 371,709
   - File Count: 1,934,177
   - Item Count: 2,305,942

## Root Cause
The large *_Extractor_* log files were generated by the Sensitive Data Discovery module during scans of a large file server. The debug logging level was set too high, resulting in excessive log file sizes.

## Solution
- The logging level was changed from Debug to Warning, which significantly reduced the size of the log files generated by the SDD job.
- The customer was advised to monitor the size of the *_Extractor_* files after the logging level adjustment and report back on any changes.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly check and manage log file retention settings to prevent excessive disk space usage.
- For future cases, consider advising customers to lower the logging level if they are experiencing similar issues with large log files.
- The customer should be informed about the expected size of log files based on their scanning configurations to avoid confusion.
