## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000MfAGTIA3
- **Case Number:** 438019
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Overseas Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC)
- **Contact Name:** Shashitharan Navandran
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Feature:** N/A
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested information regarding application hardening for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) as part of an ongoing audit. They specifically sought details on hardening measures implemented by the vendor, distinct from operating system hardening.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reached out to the customer to clarify the specifics of "application hardening."
2. Provided links to relevant documentation regarding security methods available in the application, including:
   - Securing reports
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
3. Followed up with the customer multiple times to check for updates and further questions.
4. Created additional tickets for related products (Netwrix Threat Prevention and Netwrix Threat Manager) to address broader security concerns.

## Root Cause
The customer was unclear about the specific hardening measures available for the application, as there is no dedicated hardening guide provided by Netwrix. The existing security measures are documented in the Help Center, but the customer required a more consolidated response for audit purposes.

## Solution
The support team informed the customer that while there is no specific hardening guide, they could refer to the documentation for security methods implemented in the application. The customer was directed to the relevant links for securing reports and implementing RBAC. After providing this information, the support team confirmed with the customer if they needed further assistance before closing the ticket.

## Notes
- There is no official hardening guide available for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor; customers should be directed to the Help Center for security documentation.
- If similar requests arise, ensure to clarify the customer's needs regarding application hardening and provide them with the relevant documentation links.
- The ticket can be reopened within 30 days if further assistance is required; after this period, a new ticket must be created.
