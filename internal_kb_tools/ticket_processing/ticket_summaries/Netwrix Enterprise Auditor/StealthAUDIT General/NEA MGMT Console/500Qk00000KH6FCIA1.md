## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KH6FCIA1
- **Case Number:** 431247
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Federated Hermes
- **Contact Name:** Dennis Nicholson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a newly added administrator could not access the StealthAudit application, despite being listed as an Administrator alongside other users.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the new user was added as an "Administrator" in the access section of StealthAudit.
2. Inquired about the exact location of the user addition (machine or console).
3. Provided the customer with steps to add the new user to the appropriate role group in SQL.
4. Advised the customer to verify that the user was included in the Access node within NEA Settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the new administrator not being correctly configured in the Access node of the NEA Settings, despite being added to the SQL role group.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by ensuring that the new user was added to the correct group with Database Owner (DBO) permissions. After confirming their addition in the Access Node as an administrator, the user was able to access the application as expected.

## Notes
- Always verify that new users are added to both the appropriate SQL role group and the Access node in NEA Settings to prevent similar access issues.
- Document any changes made to user roles and permissions for future reference.
