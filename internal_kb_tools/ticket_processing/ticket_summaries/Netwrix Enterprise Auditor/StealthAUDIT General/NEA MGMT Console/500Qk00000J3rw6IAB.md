- **Case Number:** 428741
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Doctors Company
- **Contact Name:** Chad Fontanini
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Feature:** FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested data on who accessed specific shares within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) system. They were unsure of the data retention period and requested access logs for the last year and the last 90 days.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved the FSAC (File System Activity Collector) system scan and Bulk Import jobs for NetApp and Nasuni filers.
- The activity monitor agent was used as a proxy to scan event activity on these filers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified errors in the FSAC system scan and Bulk Import jobs that prevented data from being displayed in the AIC (Auditor Interface Console).
2. Verified that the activity monitor agent was functioning correctly.
3. Targeted the NetApp host for both FSAC and Bulk Import jobs.
4. Created new job folders for NetApp and Nasuni in the Jobs directory.
5. Moved existing jobs to the Nasuni folder and copied relevant jobs to the NetApp folder.
6. Configured new jobs to scan the NetApp servers with appropriate connection profiles.
7. Removed NetApp hosts from the Nasuni jobs to avoid conflicts.
8. Ran the FSAC system scan job for the NetApp hosts, which completed successfully.
9. Scheduled Bulk Import jobs for the NetApp job group.
10. Monitored the AIC for updates on the imported activity data.

## Root Cause
The FSAC system scan and Bulk Import jobs were displaying errors due to misconfiguration, which prevented activity data from being displayed in the AIC. Specifically, the jobs were not properly separated for the different NAS systems, leading to conflicts in query mapping configurations.

## Solution
- Successfully reconfigured the jobs by creating separate job folders for NetApp and Nasuni, ensuring that each set of jobs targeted the correct hosts.
- Ran the FSAC system scan and Bulk Import jobs for the NetApp hosts, which allowed the activity data to be indexed into the SQL database.
- After a few hours, the AIC updated to display the recent activity data from the NetApp hosts.

## Notes
- It is important to stagger the scheduling of FSAC and Bulk Import jobs for different NAS systems to mitigate potential table locks on the SQL database.
- Ensure that job configurations are clearly separated for different file systems to avoid conflicts in data collection and reporting.
