## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IV9UUIA1
- **Case Number:** 427474
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Overseas Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC)
- **Contact Name:** Shashitharan Navandran
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an access issue when attempting to open the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console (NEA). The error message indicated that the admin account did not have the necessary access rights, despite previously having them.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.117

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to access the NEA console with the admin account.
2. Deleted the "RbaConfigured" key from the registry path `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Stealthbits`.
3. Removed the "rba.conf" file from the NEA installation directory.
4. Encountered an error indicating that the license was expired.
5. Imported the license and completed the setup wizard.
6. Noted that the NEA wizard prompted for SQL database credentials.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a misconfiguration of access rights within the NEA console, likely related to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings. The expired license further complicated the access issue.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Deleting the problematic registry key and configuration file to reset the access settings.
- Importing a valid license to restore functionality.
- The customer was instructed to acquire the SQL database credentials necessary for completing the setup wizard.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SQL database credentials are correctly configured to avoid future access issues.
- It is advisable to verify RBAC settings after any changes to user accounts or permissions.
- If similar access issues arise, consider checking for expired licenses and misconfigured settings in the registry or configuration files.
