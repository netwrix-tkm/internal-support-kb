- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The security team raised concerns regarding the use of a remote service that employs an SSL certificate chain signed with a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (SHA-1). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to generate a fraudulent certificate, posing as the affected service.

## Environment Details
- The affected software includes:
  - Any .NET 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.28 or earlier.
  - Any .NET 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.17 or earlier.
  - Any .NET 8.0 application running on .NET 8.0.3 or earlier.
- The current version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor in use is 11.5.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the vulnerability reported by Tenable.io, identifying it as CVE-2024-21409, a .NET Privilege Elevation vulnerability.
2. Discussed the SSL ciphers vulnerability related to the digest size of the secure hash algorithm used in the 11.5 application.
3. Suggested updating SSL certificate digital signatures to use SHA-384 for enhanced security.
4. Planned to take snapshots of servers before applying updates to ensure a revert point.
5. Scheduled meetings to discuss further actions and gather additional information.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the use of SHA-1 for SSL certificate signing, which is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. This was compounded by the presence of a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-21409) affecting certain .NET versions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Replacing the SHA-1 digest size with SHA-384 using a Group Policy Object (GPO).
- Applying the necessary cumulative updates (CUs) to the affected servers to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that all SSL certificates are updated to use stronger hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-384) to prevent potential security breaches.
- Regularly review and apply updates to .NET applications to avoid vulnerabilities associated with outdated versions.
- Always take server snapshots before making significant changes to allow for easy rollback if necessary.
