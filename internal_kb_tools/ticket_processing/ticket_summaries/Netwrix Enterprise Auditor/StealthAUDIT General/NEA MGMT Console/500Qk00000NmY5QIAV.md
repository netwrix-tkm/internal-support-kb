- **Case Number:** 441192
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KPMG Management Services LP
- **Contact Name:** Jason Skidmore
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** NEA MGMT Console
- **Version:** 11.6.0.88

## Problem Description
The customer was unable to add a new file server to the Host Management or host list, receiving an error message stating: "Could not add hosts from list." The attempt was made manually through the wizard.

## Environment Details
- The customer was running an outdated version of the software (NEA v11.6.0.88), which was significantly behind the latest version (11.6.0.139).
- Multiple Active Directory jobs were running concurrently, causing performance issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the service account used for adding the host was active, not locked, and had the correct password.
2. Checked the activity monitor, which showed the new file server was recognized and displaying changes.
3. Reviewed the SADebug.TSV log for error messages.
4. Identified that three Active Directory jobs were running simultaneously, which was locking each other out.
5. Killed the two Active Directory jobs and one Active Directory Inventory job that were running for an extended period.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the transaction log for the database 'StealthAudit' being full due to 'ACTIVE_TRANSACTION'. This was a result of three Active Directory jobs running concurrently and not completing successfully, which led to resource contention.

## Solution
After terminating the two problematic Active Directory jobs and the Active Directory Inventory job, the customer was able to successfully add the host name. The jobs were scheduled to restart the following day, and if they completed within acceptable timelines, the system would function normally.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor job execution times and avoid running multiple long-running jobs simultaneously to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should consider upgrading to the latest version of the software to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
