## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000F5ym5IAB
- **Case Number:** 419533
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bank of America Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Gregory Meyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when attempting to load the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application, stating that the default storage profile is missing and that the current user does not have permission to configure storage profiles.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Age:** 7.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified the issue as a possible permission-based problem with the admin account used to access the NEA application.
2. Attempted to reset the storage profile node by modifying the `SPProfiles.xml` file to remove existing profile information, leaving only the following:
   ```xml
   <SPPROFILES>
       <SCHEMAVERSION>1.0.0</SCHEMAVERSION>
       <PROFILES> </PROFILES>
   </SPPROFILES>
   ```
3. Verified that the account used had a dbo schema under both the NEA database and the master database.
4. Suggested moving the account to the master database to see if it resolved the issue.
5. Ultimately performed a fresh installation of the NEA application, uninstalling and removing all previous registry values.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the absence of a default storage profile and insufficient permissions for the current user to configure storage profiles.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing a fresh installation of the NEA application. This involved uninstalling the application and ensuring that all previous registry values were removed, which allowed the application to recreate the necessary storage profiles correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to configure storage profiles to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document the steps for modifying the `SPProfiles.xml` file for future reference, as this was a key troubleshooting step.
- Always verify user permissions and roles within the database before proceeding with application installations or modifications.
