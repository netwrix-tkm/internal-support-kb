## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J3X7qIAF
- **Case Number:** 428731
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bremer Bank
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Mayavski
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Credentials
- **Feature:** gMSA
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer sought clarification on a statement from the Netwrix documentation regarding the permissions required for the account running the Enterprise Auditor to retrieve the Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) password. They were experiencing permission denied errors with the gMSA account they created and were uncertain about which account required additional permissions.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the documentation regarding gMSA account requirements.
2. Clarified whether the account referenced in the documentation was the one running the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor web server or the accounts of users with admin access.
3. Investigated the permissions of the gMSA account and the accounts running scheduled tasks or the NEA console.
4. Consulted with R&D to understand the limitations of using gMSA with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of the permissions required for the gMSA account. Specifically, the account running the scheduled tasks or the NEA console needed to have the capability to retrieve the gMSA account password. If tasks were running as the System account, the computer object in Active Directory (AD) required this capability. If running as a service account, that specific service account needed the permissions.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying that:
- The account running scheduled tasks or the NEA console must have permissions to retrieve the gMSA password.
- If scheduled tasks are executed as the System account, the computer object in AD must have the gMSA password retrieval capability.
- Interactive users running the NEA console also need this capability to manually initiate jobs.

The customer decided to discontinue their efforts to convert to gMSA due to the complexity of the required permissions and the deviation from their standard processes.

## Notes
- Future implementations of gMSA with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor should ensure that the appropriate permissions are assigned to both the service account and the computer object in AD.
- Customers should be aware that using gMSA may require additional configuration and permissions management, which could complicate standard operational procedures.
