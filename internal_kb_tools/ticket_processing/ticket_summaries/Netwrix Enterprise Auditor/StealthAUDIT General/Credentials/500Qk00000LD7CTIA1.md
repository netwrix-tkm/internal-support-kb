## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message stating "Default storage profile is missing" when attempting to start the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) console after installing version 11.6.0.127 and configuring SQL Server authentication.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** NEA 11.6.0.127
- **SQL Authentication:** Customer was using SQL Server authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the installation of NEA version 11.6.0.127.
2. Attempted to start the NEA console, which resulted in the error message.
3. Reviewed previous similar cases for potential solutions.
4. Suggested re-installing NEA as a potential fix based on historical resolutions.
5. Requested clarification from the customer regarding whether it was an initial setup and the type of SQL authentication being used.
6. Provided links to documentation regarding permissions for both Windows Native and SQL Native authentication.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as potentially related to a lack of permissions on the NEA SQL database. The error message indicated that the user account attempting to access the NEA console did not have the necessary SQL permissions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by rebooting the NEA server after the re-installation. This action allowed the console to start without displaying the "Default storage profile is missing" error.
