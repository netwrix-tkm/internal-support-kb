## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OQDVIIA5
- **Case Number:** 443134
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Liberty Bank
- **Contact Name:** Philip Richards
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after updating the service account password, the Access Information Center (AIC) was unable to authenticate users, while the Enterprise Auditor continued to function without issues.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the service account password had been updated.
2. Provided documentation detailing all locations where the service account credentials needed to be updated.
3. Suggested updating the AIC credentials in the Windows services console for the AIC service.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the service account credentials being updated without also updating the corresponding configuration settings in the Access Information Center.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Providing the customer with documentation on where to update the service account credentials.
- Updating the account information within the configuration settings for the AIC.
- The customer discovered that the configuration credentials under Active Directory in the AIC must be changed prior to changing the service account password or while still logged in. The customer deleted the outdated setting from the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config` file, which allowed them to log in and reset it to the new password.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that any configuration settings related to service account credentials are updated immediately after a password change to avoid authentication issues.
- Future documentation should explicitly mention the need to update Active Directory configuration credentials in the AIC before or during the service account password change process.
