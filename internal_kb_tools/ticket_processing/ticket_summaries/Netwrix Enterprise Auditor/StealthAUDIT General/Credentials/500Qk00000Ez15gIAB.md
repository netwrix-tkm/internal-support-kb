## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity on all the locations where the service account password needed to be updated during the password rotation process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with a comprehensive list of all the locations within the StealthAUDIT application and the broader environment where the service account password needed to be updated. This included both application settings and system services.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to be aware of all the locations where service account credentials may need to be updated to avoid service disruptions.
- Future password rotations should include a checklist of all relevant locations to ensure a smooth transition and compliance with security policies.
