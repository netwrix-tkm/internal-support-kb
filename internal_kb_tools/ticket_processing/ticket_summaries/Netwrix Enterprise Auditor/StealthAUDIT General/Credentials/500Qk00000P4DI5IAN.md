- **Case Number:** 444813
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Edelman Financial Engines
- **Contact Name:** Jim Manalo
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that scheduled jobs in Netwrix Auditor were not running, and reports in StealthAudit had not refreshed since March 25. The customer was unable to remote into the servers, suspecting connectivity issues due to a recent migration.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to remote into the servers but could not establish a connection.
2. Investigated the scheduled tasks and credentials used for the jobs.
3. Identified that the account used in the scheduled task was incorrectly entered.

## Root Cause
The scheduled task credentials were incorrectly configured, which prevented the jobs from running successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer updated the scheduled task credentials to the correct service account, which was the same as before. After this change, the scheduled jobs began running as expected.

## Notes
- Ensure that scheduled task credentials are verified after any migration or system changes to prevent similar issues.
- Regularly check the status of scheduled jobs and their last run times to catch issues early.
