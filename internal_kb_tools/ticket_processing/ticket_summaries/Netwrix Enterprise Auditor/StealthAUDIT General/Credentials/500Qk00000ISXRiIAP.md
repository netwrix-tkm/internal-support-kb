## Problem Description
The customer, Jesse Doran from Honeywell, reported that they were unable to log into the Netwrix Customer Portal using their email address (jessie.doran@honeywell.com). This prevented them from uploading necessary logging information related to another support ticket (00422947).

## Environment Details
- Customer Portal URL: https://dev3.netwrix.com/adm
- Customer's email: jessie.doran@honeywell.com

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the customer's account was active in the Netwrix Customer Portal.
2. Attempted to reset the password for the customer's account.
3. Informed the customer that they were not registered as a user on the portal.
4. Provided the customer with registration instructions and a link to register.
5. Suggested a temporary workaround by contacting another user (Scott Stefani) to upload the logs on their behalf.
6. Followed up with the customer to confirm if they could access the portal after the password reset.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that Jesse Doran had not registered as a user on the Netwrix Customer Portal, which prevented them from logging in.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Confirming the customer's account was active.
- Resetting the password for the account.
- Providing the customer with the necessary steps to register on the portal, which allowed them to log in successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are registered users on the Customer Portal before troubleshooting login issues.
- Provide clear registration instructions to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Consider enabling features that allow users to manage each other's tickets if they are part of the same organization.
