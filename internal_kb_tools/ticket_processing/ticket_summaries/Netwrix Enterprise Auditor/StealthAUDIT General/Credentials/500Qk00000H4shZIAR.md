## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H4shZIAR
- **Case Number:** 424018
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Fidelity Assurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Calvin Minnick
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the application in CyberArk was never set up for Hash-based authentication and was instead configured using "OS User." Following an upgrade of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, credentials could not be retrieved from CyberArk.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the CyberArk configuration for the application.
2. Checked the documentation for CyberArk integration with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
3. Identified that two values were cleared or corrupted during the upgrade:
   - The AppID value "StealthAUDIT" was missing from `%sainstalldir%StealthAUDITGlobalOptions.xml`.
   - The Folder value was cleared from the Credential Profile.
4. Attempted to retrieve credentials from CyberArk but failed due to the missing configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two values being cleared or corrupted during the upgrade process:
1. The AppID value "StealthAUDIT" was not present in the `StealthAUDITGlobalOptions.xml` file.
2. The Folder value in the Credential Profile was cleared.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Updated the `StealthAUDITGlobalOptions.xml` file with the correct AppID defined in CyberArk.
   ```xml
   <AppID>StealthAUDIT</AppID>
   ```
2. Entered the folder "Root" into the Credential Profile.
3. Initiated a run of the Active Directory Inventory, which successfully pulled credentials from CyberArk and began scanning.

## Notes
- Ensure that the AppID and Folder values are correctly configured after any upgrades to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review the CyberArk integration settings to ensure they align with the latest documentation and configurations.
