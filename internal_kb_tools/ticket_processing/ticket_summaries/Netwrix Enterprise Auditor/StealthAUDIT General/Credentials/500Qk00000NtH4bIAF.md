## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NtH4bIAF
- **Case Number:** 441533
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)
- **Contact Name:** Rick He
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Credentials
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the existence of a session timeout setting for the desktop application running from the Stealth Audit server, specifically clarifying that this was not related to the web console timeout.

## Environment Details
- The environment supports both NTLM and Kerberos authentication.
- The customer uses Windows AD accounts for authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed with internal resources that there is no session timeout for the StealthAUDIT application.
2. Clarified that the timeout setting discussed was specific to the web console, which has a configurable session timeout.
3. Conducted tests to verify authentication methods used by the application.
4. Engaged in multiple email exchanges to clarify the authentication methods and timeout settings.

## Root Cause
The application does not have a configurable session timeout for the desktop GUI. The confusion arose from the distinction between web console timeouts and application GUI behavior.

## Solution
- Confirmed that the StealthAUDIT application does not implement a session timeout for the desktop application.
- Provided information that the application defaults to using Kerberos unless specified otherwise in the environment settings.
- Clarified that NTLM is not used unless specific conditions (like targeting IP addresses) are met, which would force a fallback to NTLM.

## Notes
- There is currently no active session timeout feature in the NAA application similar to web-based applications.
- A feature request has been submitted to consider implementing an active session timeout in future versions.
- It is important to ensure that the application is configured to use Kerberos where possible, as NTLM is considered outdated and vulnerable.
