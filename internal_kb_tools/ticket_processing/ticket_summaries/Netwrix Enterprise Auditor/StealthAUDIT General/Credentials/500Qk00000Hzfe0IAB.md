- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Contact Name:** Emmanuel Mvubu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Credentials
- **Feature:** Integration
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether Netwrix Enterprise Auditor supports integration with BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management (PAM) similar to the existing integration with CyberArk.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing integration capabilities of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor with CyberArk PAM.
2. Confirmed that there is currently no built-in integration with BeyondTrust PAM.
3. Suggested the use of Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as an alternative for enhanced security.
4. Provided links to relevant documentation regarding gMSA and connection profile configuration.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the customer's inquiry was the absence of a built-in integration feature for BeyondTrust PAM in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is available for CyberArk PAM.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that:
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor does not currently support integration with BeyondTrust PAM.
- As an alternative, the customer can utilize Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) for improved security in managing service accounts. Detailed instructions and links to relevant documentation were provided to assist in configuring gMSA.

## Notes
- A feature request for BeyondTrust integration has been submitted to the product management team.
- The customer was asked to provide additional details regarding their use case and desired implementation for the feature request.
- It is important to note that while gMSA provides better security than standard service accounts, it requires proper configuration in the User Credentials window when creating a Connection Profile.
