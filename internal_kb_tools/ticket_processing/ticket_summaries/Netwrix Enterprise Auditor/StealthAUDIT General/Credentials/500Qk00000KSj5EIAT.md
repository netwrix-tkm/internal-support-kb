- **Case Number:** 431727
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Nexidia

- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Credentials

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a specific domain account, used in two different connection profiles, was repeatedly locking itself out. The account in question is not the same as the one used elsewhere in Netwrix for SQL and tasks. The customer had already validated and reset the password within the connection profiles, but the lockouts persisted.

## Environment Details
- The account (ondemandsvcAuditor) was locking out at approximately 9:35 AM, while all jobs associated with it were scheduled to run overnight between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM.
- The issue was isolated to one of seven domains.
- The customer had set up NTP to audit logins and authentications to track potential triggers for the account lockout.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the password and manually reset it within the connection profiles.
2. Separated job schedules to run on different nights to isolate the issue.
3. Monitored job execution times and confirmed that jobs were completing within an hour.
4. Set up NTP monitoring to audit failed logins and track authentication events.
5. Investigated potential issues related to another ticket (431038) that might be connected.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the account lockout was not identified as being related to Netwrix products. The lockout occurred at a time when no Netwrix jobs were running with the account, suggesting that the issue was external to the Netwrix environment.

## Solution
The customer was assisted in setting up NTP monitoring to track failed login attempts for the account. This monitoring allowed the customer to identify the source of the lockouts, and they were able to resolve the issue independently after gathering the necessary event logs.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all instances where the service account is used are updated with the correct credentials, especially after a password change.
- Future investigations into account lockouts should include a thorough review of all systems and applications that may be using the account, not just those directly related to Netwrix products.
- Customers experiencing similar issues should be encouraged to implement auditing tools to track authentication events for better visibility into potential causes of account lockouts.
