## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FJPoUIAX
- **Case Number:** 419977
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Point32Health Services, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Peter Sterianos
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the Activity Collection jobs, which were ending successfully after running for 0 seconds without any errors. Additionally, the bulk import was failing due to an out-of-memory issue.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs for the Activity Collection jobs and bulk import tasks.
2. Identified that the bulk import was failing with the error: 
   ```
   code = NoMem (7), message = System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException (0x800007AF): out of memory
   ```
3. Investigated potential conflicts in job scheduling that could lead to memory issues.
4. Communicated with the customer to adjust scheduled jobs to avoid overlaps.
5. Discussed the impact of interrupted jobs on the tempdb database and SQL host disk space.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as conflicts in job scheduling, which led to simultaneous execution of jobs that caused the bulk import to fail due to memory exhaustion. Additionally, if NEA jobs did not complete correctly, the tempdb database would not clear out, resulting in disk space issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the scheduled jobs to prevent conflicts that caused the out-of-memory errors. The customer was advised to ensure that jobs do not overlap and to monitor the execution of jobs closely. It was also noted that re-running the bulk import followed by the scheduled jobs resolved the immediate failures.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor job schedules to avoid overlaps that can lead to memory issues.
- If NEA jobs do not complete correctly, it can result in the tempdb not clearing out, leading to potential disk space issues on the SQL host.
- The customer indicated that previous versions did not exhibit the same failure behavior when jobs were interrupted, suggesting a possible regression in the current version.
- Future upgrades should be considered to address any underlying bugs related to job execution and memory management.
