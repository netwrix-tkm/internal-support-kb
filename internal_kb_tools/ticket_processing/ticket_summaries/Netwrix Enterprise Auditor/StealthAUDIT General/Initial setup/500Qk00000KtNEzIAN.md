## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KtNEzIAN
- **Case Number:** 433014
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Gleaner Life Insurance Society
- **Contact Name:** Mark Cruz
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that audits were not running as expected on their servers, leading to concerns about the empty LastAudit column for some hosts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the LastAudit column for the affected hosts to confirm it was empty.
2. Communicated with the customer to understand their concerns regarding the empty LastAudit column.
3. Explained the functionality of the LastAudit column and its non-impact on the application's ability to collect data.

## Root Cause
The empty LastAudit column does not indicate a failure in the auditing process or data collection. It is a non-critical field that does not affect the overall functionality of the application.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that the LastAudit column being empty does not prevent the host from collecting data and does not affect the application's performance. This explanation alleviated the customer's concerns.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate clearly about the functionality of specific fields within the application to prevent misunderstandings.
- Future inquiries regarding the LastAudit column should emphasize that it is not a critical indicator of audit functionality.
