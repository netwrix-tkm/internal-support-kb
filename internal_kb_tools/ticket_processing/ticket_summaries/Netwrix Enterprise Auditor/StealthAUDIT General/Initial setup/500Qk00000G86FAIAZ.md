## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G86FAIAZ
- **Case Number:** 421780
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Paper Company
- **Contact Name:** Meredith Johnson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The StealthAudit Report for Weak Password Checks was not pulling in data for the NA domain, while data from other domains was being populated correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Age of Issue:** 25.2 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the host list assigned to the AD Weak Passwords job.
2. Identified a connection profile error associated with the host list.
3. Checked the Active Directory parent job group for host list assignments.
4. Noted that the AD Weak Passwords job was targeting only the "One Domain Controller Per Domain" host list.
5. Configured the job to use the correct connection profile for scanning hosts.
6. Assigned the same ADI host list to the Active Directory parent job group for consistency.
7. Ran the AD Weak Passwords job again to check for data population.
8. Verified that the populated data was accessible in the Published Reports console.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a connection profile error in the host list assigned to the AD Weak Passwords job. Additionally, the Active Directory parent job group did not have a host list assigned, which affected the data retrieval for the NA domain.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Correcting the connection profile used by the AD Weak Passwords job.
- Assigning the same ADI host list to the Active Directory parent job group to ensure continuity.
- After making these changes, the AD Weak Passwords job was successfully executed, resulting in the population of the most recent data in the Weak Passwords Checks report.

## Notes
- Ensure that all job groups have the appropriate host lists assigned to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify connection profiles and host list assignments to maintain data integrity across reports.
