## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O6k3yIAB
- **Case Number:** 442226
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Qatar Energy
- **Contact Name:** Ohoud Hamad Kh Al-Kaabi
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Backend Server Fix
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) was experiencing high memory utilization, reaching 90% of available RAM.

## Environment Details
- **SQL Server Configuration:** 
  - Dedicated SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer
  - 8 CPU cores
  - 36 GB RAM

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the reported RAM utilization of 90% on the SQL server.
2. Verified that the SQL server was dedicated and not shared with the application.
3. Collected details about the server's resources (8 cores, 36GB RAM).
4. Inquired about any recent changes in the application, specifically regarding job configurations.
5. Checked for any running jobs or tasks in the Enterprise Auditor console; none were found.
6. Investigated the Enterprise Auditor logs for active tasks; no active tasks were indicated.
7. Executed a query in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to check for active connections:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       session_id,
       login_name,
       host_name,
       program_name,
       login_time,
       status
   FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
   ```
   - Result showed only the connection from SSMS.
8. Consulted with the database administrator regarding expected memory behavior in SQL Server.

## Root Cause
The high RAM utilization was attributed to the SQL Server's behavior of retaining allocated memory for performance optimization, even when tasks were not actively running. The customer had recently enabled multiple jobs that were previously disabled, leading to increased memory usage.

## Solution
The database administrator recommended setting a memory cap for the SQL server to limit RAM utilization to under 90%. This was implemented by adjusting the server memory options in SSMS:
- Navigated to: Database Instance > Properties > Memory > Server memory options settings.
- Set a cap of 30 GB of RAM.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor job configurations and their impact on memory utilization in SQL Server.
- Future cases should consider consulting with a database administrator when high memory usage is reported, as it may be expected behavior based on SQL Server's memory management practices.
