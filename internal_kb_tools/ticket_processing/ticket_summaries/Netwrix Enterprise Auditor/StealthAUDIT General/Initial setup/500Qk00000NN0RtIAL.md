## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while attempting to pull in new DFS configurations for a server replacement. The error message indicated that the RPC server was unavailable, and they were unable to access or update the DFS configurations in the Audit Information Center (AIC).

## Environment Details
- The issue arose after the replacement of three servers that hosted shares.
- The DFS configuration was not properly targeting the DFS Namespace Server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and identified errors when targeting the "One Domain Controller Per Domain" host list instead of the DFS Host.
2. Targeted the DFS Namespace server, which allowed for a successful scan and updated DFS Namespace information.
3. Conducted a successful FSAA Bulk Import and tested the information within the AIC.
4. Ran SQL queries to verify the updated folder paths against the FSDFS_Links table.
5. Removed a duplicate entry in the FSDFS_Links table that did not have any links attached.
6. Enabled the Resolve Links tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import.

## Root Cause
The initial configuration was incorrectly targeting "One Domain Controller Per Domain," which did not include the DFS Namespace Server. This misconfiguration prevented the system from accessing the necessary DFS links.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correctly targeting the DFS Namespace server for scans.
- Successfully running the FSDFS System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import, which populated the updated DFS Namespace information.
- Verifying the updates in the SQL database and ensuring that the links were correctly indexed.

## Notes
- For future cases, ensure that the DFS Namespace is correctly configured and accessible on the DFS server.
- It is crucial to run successful FSDFS system scans and FSAA Bulk Imports to reflect changes in the AIC.
- If issues persist, consider checking for duplicate entries in the FSDFS_Links table, as these can cause null values and prevent proper indexing.
