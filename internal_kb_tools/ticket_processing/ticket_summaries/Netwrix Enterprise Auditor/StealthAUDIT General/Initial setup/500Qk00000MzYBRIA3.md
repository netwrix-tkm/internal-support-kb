## Problem Description
The customer reported that a custom job designed to integrate Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) with ServiceNow was generating duplicate tickets. Specifically, the job responsible for retrieving ticket statuses was returning only one result, leading to the creation of multiple tickets for the same account.

## Environment Details
- The customer operates multiple environments: Development, Production, and a newly added Test environment.
- The Test environment has a separate database and ServiceNow instance but references the Production Active Directory (AD).

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested confirmation on whether the jobs in use were custom-built.
2. Questions were posed regarding the expected output of the jobs and the status of similar jobs in the Production environment.
3. The customer was asked to provide details on any changes made since the last successful operation.
4. The support engineer awaited the customer's response for further investigation.
5. The customer conducted their own testing and identified a potential issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified, but it was suspected that the customer may have misconfigured some aspects of the custom job, leading to the generation of duplicate tickets.

## Solution
The customer successfully resolved the issue by:
- Conducting further testing in the Test environment.
- Migrating the corrected jobs and configurations from Test to Production, which resulted in the expected behavior without duplicate ticket creation.

## Notes
- It is important for customers using custom jobs to ensure proper configuration and testing in a controlled environment before migrating to Production.
- The customer expressed a desire for better methods to transfer settings and configurations between environments, indicating a potential area for improvement in their workflow.
