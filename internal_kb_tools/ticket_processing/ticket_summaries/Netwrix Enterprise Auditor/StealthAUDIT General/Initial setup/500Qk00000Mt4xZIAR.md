- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Broadview Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Marc Payzant
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Initial setup
- **Feature:** Threat Protector
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, Broadview Federal Credit Union, required assistance in installing Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Threat Protector in a new domain environment. They faced issues with SQL server connectivity and permissions, which hindered the installation and configuration process.

## Environment Details
- New domain environment with newly built servers.
- SQL Server and NEA application server required to communicate effectively.
- The customer was licensed for the minimum features of NEA, including Active Directory Inventory and AD job groups.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled initial meetings to review server configurations and requirements.
2. Conducted a UDL test to check SQL Server connectivity, which initially failed.
3. Reviewed settings from the old system to inform the new implementation.
4. Ensured the SQL server and NEA application server could communicate by setting up the loopback address in the NTP configuration.
5. Confirmed that the service account had the necessary permissions to access the application.
6. Monitored the Activity Monitor for data reception from the Domain Controller.
7. Investigated the logs for errors related to access permissions and connectivity.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was identified as a failure in communication between the NEA application server and the SQL server, attributed to incorrect permissions for the service account and potential conflicts with security software (Carbon Black) installed on the Domain Controller.

## Solution
- The service account permissions were corrected to ensure access to the application.
- The loopback address was configured in the NTP settings to facilitate communication.
- A new ticket was created to address ongoing issues with the Activity Monitor, and a follow-up meeting was scheduled to resolve the remaining concerns.

## Notes
- Ensure that all service accounts have the necessary permissions before installation.
- Verify that security software does not interfere with server communications.
- Regularly monitor logs for access denied errors to preemptively address permission issues.
- Follow up with the customer to confirm that all features are functioning as expected after installation.
