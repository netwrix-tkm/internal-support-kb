- **Case Number:** 430189
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Broadview Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Marc Payzant
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in moving the Netwrix Auditor and Intercept products to a new domain. They needed help with scoping their infrastructure, including server configuration and service accounts, as well as installing and configuring the products for the new domain.

## Environment Details
- The customer is creating a new environment with a new Domain Controller (DC) and SQL server.
- No data migration is planned; this is a fresh installation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with a link to schedule a meeting with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) team.
2. Explained the need to follow the new environment's guidelines for proper server permissions.
3. Confirmed that since this is a new installation, no migration of data is involved.
4. Suggested that the customer open a new ticket when ready to install NEA on the new server.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need for guidance on setting up a new environment rather than migrating existing data. The request was primarily for initial setup assistance in a new domain.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the customer's requirements and providing them with the necessary resources to set up their new environment. The customer was informed that they would need to adhere to the guidelines for the new environment and that they could reach out again when they were ready to proceed with the installation.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers understand the distinction between a new installation and a migration to avoid confusion in future cases.
- It may be beneficial to involve the Account Owner or Professional Services for implementation if the setup is complex or requires additional resources.
