## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HS51SIAT
- **Case Number:** 425035
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** West Yavapai Guidance Clinic, DBA Polara Health
- **Contact Name:** Josh Taylor
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6.0.113

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in setting up connections with Entra (for Entra ID Inventory), Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online after upgrading to Netwrix Enterprise Audit version 11.6.0.113.

## Environment Details
- The upgrade to Netwrix Enterprise Audit was completed on 10/23/2024.
- Jobs set up in zSandbox for preparation included:
  - AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth
  - EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth
  - SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the upgrade to Netwrix Enterprise Audit 11.6.0.113.
2. Scheduled meetings with the customer to discuss setup and permissions.
3. Advised the customer to run the following PowerShell commands on the server hosting NEA:
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
   ```
4. Verified Exchange permissions and updated them in EAC/Entra.
5. Ran the job "EX_Perms" to check for permissions errors.

## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from incorrect permissions assigned in Exchange Online, which were resolved after updating the permissions in the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) and Entra.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Updating the permissions for the user in EAC/Entra, which eliminated the previous permissions error.
- Addressing subsequent errors related to server availability (503 errors) and disabled users, which were identified during the execution of the "EX_Perms" job.

## Notes
- Future setups should ensure that all necessary permissions are correctly assigned before running jobs to avoid similar issues.
- Monitor for any server availability issues (503 errors) that may arise during job execution, as these can indicate broader service disruptions.
- It is recommended to verify the status of disabled users and their licensing to prevent errors related to invalid user settings.
