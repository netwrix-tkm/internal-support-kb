## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Bg3hXIAR
- **Case Number:** 411543
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with an HR folder activity job that was intended to alert when users read files. The existing exceptions were functioning correctly for the HR manager, but the customer needed guidance on how to add another user to the whitelist to prevent alerts from triggering for them.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to schedule a meeting for further investigation.
2. During the meeting, it was determined that the issue was not with the StealthAUDIT application but with the Intercept or Defend policies.
3. Logged into the SI console to identify the policy responsible for sending alerts but could not locate it.
4. Discussed the need to add an exception for two users who access the HR folder to prevent alerts from triggering.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a lack of clarity regarding which policy in the Intercept or Defend system was responsible for sending alerts when users accessed the HR folder.

## Solution
The customer discovered the option to manage exceptions under the Threat Manager by navigating to "Investigate > My Investigations." This allowed them to add the necessary user to the whitelist, resolving the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of where to find the policy settings in the Threat Manager for future reference.
- It is important to clarify the distinction between the StealthAUDIT application and the Intercept or Defend policies when troubleshooting similar issues.
