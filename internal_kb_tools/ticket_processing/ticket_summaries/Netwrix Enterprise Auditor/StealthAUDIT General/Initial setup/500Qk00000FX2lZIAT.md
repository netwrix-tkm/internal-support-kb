- **Case Number:** 420460
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Credit One Bank
- **Contact Name:** Vijay Chandar
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup

## Problem Description
The customer, Credit One Bank, requested guidance on configuring the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) to effectively look for sensitive data types in alignment with industry best practices for data security.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 80

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer was licensed for "Sensitive Data" in NEA.
2. Reviewed the configuration settings for sensitive data discovery in NEA.
3. Identified that the SEEK job was not set up, which was necessary for scanning.
4. Suggested that the scan should target the same File System Objects as the Permissions (FSAA) job unless scoped differently.
5. Provided a link to the relevant section of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Configuration guide for further reference.

## Root Cause
The issue arose because the SEEK job was not configured, which is essential for the NEA to perform sensitive data discovery scans.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Setting up the SEEK job correctly.
- Ensuring that the scan was pointed to the same File System Objects that the Permissions (FSAA) job was scanning.
- The customer was directed to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 Configuration guide, specifically the section on Sensitive Data settings, which provided the necessary instructions.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the SEEK job is configured properly for sensitive data discovery to function effectively.
- Future configurations should always verify that the scan targets align with existing jobs to avoid similar issues.
