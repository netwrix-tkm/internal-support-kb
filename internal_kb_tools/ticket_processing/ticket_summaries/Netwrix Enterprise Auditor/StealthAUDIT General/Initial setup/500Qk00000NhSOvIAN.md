## Problem Description
The customer, ConocoPhillips, requested assistance in setting up a new environment to monitor an Isilon storage array using Netwrix's StealthAudit, Access Information Center, and Threat Manager, similar to their existing NetApp setup.

## Environment Details
- The customer plans to deploy a second Access Auditor environment.
- The existing deployment is large, and the customer is concerned about the database's ability to handle additional data from the Isilon.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to confirm their requirements.
2. Discussed the need for a separate environment versus integrating Isilon into the existing setup.
3. Engaged the professional services team to assist with the setup.
4. Provided documentation on scaling suggestions for the new VMs.
5. Followed up with the customer to gather additional information regarding their deployment needs.

## Root Cause
The customer opted for a separate deployment due to concerns that their current database could not handle the additional data load from the Isilon storage array, which they anticipated would be significant.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by referring the customer to the professional services team, who will assist with the full setup and installation of the new environment. The customer was informed that this service would incur additional costs.

## Notes
- Professional services are chargeable and will incur additional costs.
- It is important to assess the customer's existing infrastructure and data load capacity before proceeding with similar setups to avoid performance degradation.
- Ensure clear communication regarding the scope of services provided by the support team versus professional services.
