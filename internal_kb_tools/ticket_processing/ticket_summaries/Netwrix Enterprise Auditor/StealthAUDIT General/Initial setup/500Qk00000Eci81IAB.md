- **Case Number:** 418443
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Virginia Lottery
- **Contact Name:** James Monteria
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the "Published Reports" icons not functioning, preventing the creation of reports for senior management. Additionally, the customer requested assistance in setting up an automated report from the STEALTHBits Audit Server to be emailed every 60 days, detailing user breakdowns for specific folders.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified that the default browser was Internet Explorer, which caused issues opening reports.
2. Guided the customer to set Microsoft Edge as the default browser.
3. Noted that the report displayed an outdated date on the Publish Report site.
4. Reviewed the permission scan and activity scan, which failed due to the Schema job not running.
5. Ran the Schema job and the Permission scan.
6. Advised the customer to run the Activity scan and subsequently the Report group under the Activity group to update the report.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to the default browser being set to Internet Explorer, which caused compatibility problems with the report generation. Additionally, the failure of the permission and activity scans was due to the Schema job not being executed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Changing the default browser to Microsoft Edge.
- Running the necessary Schema job and Permission scan to ensure that the report generation process could access the required data.
- Ensuring that the Activity group was reviewed and the Report folder was updated as the job ran.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the default browser is compatible with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check that the Schema job runs as scheduled to prevent failures in permission and activity scans, which are critical for report generation.
