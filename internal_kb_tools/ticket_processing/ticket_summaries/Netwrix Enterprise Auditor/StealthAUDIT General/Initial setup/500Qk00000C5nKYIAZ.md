## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C5nKYIAZ
- **Case Number:** 412503
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** John Deere Company
- **Contact Name:** Scott Prigge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported inconsistencies between the filesystem permissions data in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor tool and the actual filesystem. Specifically, the tool displayed permissions for a folder that no longer existed, indicating that the data was not being updated in the database.

## Environment Details
- The customer was running a SQL query directly against the database to verify permissions data.
- The affected path was located on the host: `NPUNPUNASC003.JDNET.DEERE.COM`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial SQL Query Modification:** A modified SQL script was provided to include the Deleted USN parameter to help identify deleted resources.
2. **Meeting Scheduled:** A meeting was arranged to further investigate the issue after the initial query did not resolve the problem.
3. **Repair Tool Execution:** The repair tool was run against the target host, but it produced an error indicating that a key was not present in the dictionary.
4. **Bulk Import Job:** A manual Bulk Import job was executed for the host group, but the issue persisted.
5. **Scanning Depth Review:** It was discovered that the scanning depth of the FSAA system scan was set to only 3 levels deep, while the actual folder structure was at least 5 levels deep.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient scanning depth in the FSAA system configuration, which prevented the tool from accessing and marking older filesystem data as deleted.

## Solution
To resolve the issue:
- The scanning depth was adjusted to allow for deeper scanning, enabling the tool to access files located at greater depths in the directory structure.
- The support team provided documentation on optimizing scanning depth using different FSAA scoping options to enhance performance without significantly increasing scan times.

## Notes
- Ensure that the scanning depth is configured appropriately based on the expected directory structure to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist after adjusting the scanning depth, consider performing a tier 2 data drop or dropping the filesystem tables and re-running the FSAA permissions job.
- For further assistance with configuring scoping options, customers are encouraged to create a new ticket referencing this case number.
