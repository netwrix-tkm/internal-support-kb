- **Case Number:** 414707
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baldwin Risk Partners
- **Contact Name:** Matt Strickler
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 7.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that NEA FSAA permission scans were not capturing any new Active Directory (AD) security groups, despite multiple job executions. There were no errors in the logs indicating the cause of the issue.

## Environment Details
- **Customer Location:** Florida, US
- **Agent Installation:** Initially installed during a support call, suspected to be corrupted.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the Active Directory Inventory job group was executed before the FSAA permission scan.
2. Verified that the FSAA Bulk Import job was run after the FSAA permission scan.
3. Checked network settings to ensure that port 4498 was not blocked.
4. Attempted to identify any errors in the logs related to the FSAA permission scans.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a corruption in the agent installation that occurred during the initial setup call. This corruption prevented the proper capturing of new AD security groups.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
1. Uninstalling the agent from the server (BRPW-FS01).
2. Deleting the agent from the monitor on BRP-SMP-APP.
3. Reinstalling the agent and re-adding it to the monitor.

After these steps, the FSAA permission scans began capturing the new AD security groups correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the agent installation is verified post-setup to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always check the execution order of the Active Directory Inventory job group and FSAA jobs to ensure proper functionality.
- Monitor for any potential network issues that could affect agent communication, particularly on port 4498.
