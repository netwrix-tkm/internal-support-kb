- **Case Number:** 415128
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Cambridge
- **Contact Name:** Tara Jeffery
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SQL temp database was filling up, causing performance issues with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The issue was exacerbated by ongoing Exchange operations, leading to concerns about database capacity.

## Environment Details
- **Current SQL Disk Size Allocation:**
  - SQL DB: 1.54TB
  - SQL Transaction: 389GB
  - SQL Temp DB: 1.49TB

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed running instances and identified that Exchange operations were in progress.
2. Collected logs for Exchange and SharePoint, as well as ADI and Entra inventory.
3. Increased job timeouts for `SP_DomainUsers` and `SP_StaleUsers` from 1440 seconds to 14400 seconds.
4. Modified the sizes of the tempdb files using the following SQL script:
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = tempdev, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp2, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp3, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp4, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp5, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp6, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ALTER DATABASE tempdb
   MODIFY FILE (NAME = temp7, SIZE = 1GB, FILEGROWTH = 64MB);
   GO
   ```

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration of the tempdb size, which was set too high (200GB) for the workload. This led to the tempdb filling up quickly during operations, particularly with Exchange.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Reducing the size of each tempdb file to 1GB with a growth increment of 64MB, which allowed for better management of the tempdb space.
- Adjusting job timeouts to accommodate longer-running jobs without causing failures.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the tempdb usage closely, especially during high-load operations like Exchange and SharePoint.
- Future configurations should consider the workload to avoid setting tempdb sizes too high, which can lead to similar issues.
- Ensure that job timeouts are set appropriately based on the expected duration of operations to prevent unnecessary failures.
