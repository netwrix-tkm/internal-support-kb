## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ElHLWIA3
- **Case Number:** 418793
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Point32Health Services, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Peter Sterianos
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the SharePoint SPAC bulk import process following an upgrade from StealthAudit version 11.5 to 11.6. The process encountered errors after several hours of execution, specifically related to SQL transaction log capacity and foreign key constraints.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** StealthAudit
- **Error Messages:**
  - "Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'port_number', table 'StealthAudit.dbo.SA_SQL_Instances'; column does not allow nulls."
  - "The transaction log for database 'StealthAudit' is full due to 'ACTIVE_TRANSACTION'."
  - "Cannot open database 'StealthAUDIT' requested by the login. The login failed."

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed error logs to identify the specific SQL errors encountered during the bulk import.
2. Investigated the transaction log storage capacity and confirmed it was insufficient.
3. Attempted to run the SPAC Bulk Import job multiple times to replicate the issue.
4. Analyzed foreign key constraints and attempted to update the USN value in the SPAA_Hosts table.
5. Gathered job logs to assess the size of SPAC T2s, which were approximately 28 GB.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was identified as SQL transaction log storage capacity being insufficient to handle the active transactions during the bulk import process.

## Solution
The resolution involved modifying the transaction log storage by expanding its capacity. This adjustment allowed the bulk import process to complete successfully without encountering the previous errors.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor transaction log sizes and ensure adequate storage is allocated, especially after significant upgrades or changes to the database.
- Future bulk import processes should be tested in a controlled environment to identify potential issues before executing in production.
