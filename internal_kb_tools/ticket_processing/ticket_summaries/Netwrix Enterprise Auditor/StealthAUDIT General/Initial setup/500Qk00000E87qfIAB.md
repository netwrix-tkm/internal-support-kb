## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with mandatory password changes across multiple systems, including StealthAUDIT servers, Clone Audit servers, StealthAIC, StealthIntercept, production and clone databases, as well as all proxy servers and monitored hosts. The passwords needed to be changed before the 15th of the month.

## Environment Details
- Systems involved:
  - StealthAUDIT server
  - Clone Audit servers
  - StealthAIC
  - StealthIntercept
  - Production and clone databases
  - Various proxy servers and monitored hosts

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the previous request (Ticket #411600) for context on the password change requirements.
2. Changed passwords for:

   - StealthAUDIT Clone
   - StealthAIC
3. Adjusted connection profiles for:
   - CyberArk
   - My first profile
4. Updated the schedule profile for:
   - CONOCOsvc_varonis
5. Noted that Windows Authentication was being used for SQL database connections, indicating no password change was necessary for the database connection.

## Root Cause
The initial confusion stemmed from the requirement to change passwords across multiple systems. However, it was identified that since Windows Authentication was being utilized for SQL database connections, there was no need to change the database password.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Changing the necessary passwords for StealthAUDIT and related systems.
- Adjusting the connection and schedule profiles as required.
- Confirming that no password change was needed for the SQL database due to the use of Windows Authentication.

## Notes
- Ensure to verify the authentication method being used for database connections in future cases, as this can eliminate unnecessary password changes.
- Maintain clear documentation of password change locations and requirements to streamline future requests. A detailed PDF was referenced for password change locations, which can serve as a template for similar cases.
