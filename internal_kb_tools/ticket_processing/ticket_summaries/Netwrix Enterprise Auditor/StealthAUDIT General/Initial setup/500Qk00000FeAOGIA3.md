- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Contact Name:** Jason Skidmore

- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with configuring a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for connection profiles in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application while implementing a least privilege access model.

## Environment Details
- The issue was identified within the File System parent group jobs.
- The error message encountered was: 
  ```
  GetFSACIniAttributeValue: Error: Ini section for CAWDCAPP322 does not exist in ini file C:\ProgramData\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent\SBTFileMon.ini
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed configurations for jobs within the File System parent group.
2. Verified that the service account used in the connection profile was successfully completing jobs and capturing data.
3. Identified the error related to the ini file not containing the agent hostname.
4. Confirmed that the agent hostname was not listed in the ini file due to its role as a proxy for monitoring file system activity on a Unity host.

## Root Cause
No specific root cause was identified. The testing of a viable least privilege model (LPM) was ongoing in a development environment for future implementation in production. The error regarding the ini file was valid but not directly related to the least privilege model.

## Solution
- The configurations for the jobs were reviewed, and it was confirmed that the service account was functioning correctly under the least privilege model.
- The error regarding the ini file was acknowledged as a valid issue due to the nature of the agent's configuration, which does not list the agent hostname but does list Unity hosts.

## Notes
- It is important to continue testing different methods of the least privilege model and role-based access before implementing changes in the production environment.
- Future issues related to job failures should be documented separately, as they may not be directly related to the least privilege model being implemented.
