## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while attempting to scan Windows FileShare using Least Privileged permissions, specifically receiving an "access is denied" error message.

## Environment Details
- Target Host: Windows Server 2022
- Permissions validated: Backup Operators, Power Users, and Backup Files and Directories Local Security Policy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified permissions on the target host.
2. Attempted scanning in Local Mode.
3. Checked group memberships and local security policies.
4. Engaged in multiple communications with the customer to gather additional details and clarify the issue.
5. Conducted a lab replication of the issue to understand the underlying cause.
6. Discussed group membership requirements with the development team.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by insufficient group membership permissions for the account used in the connection profile. Specifically, the account did not have the required permissions as per the updated Least Privileged Access (LPA) recommendations for Windows Server 2022 and later.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the group membership permissions of the account used for scanning to include "Access Control Assistance Operators." This adjustment aligned with the updated LPA recommendations, allowing successful scanning of the Windows FileShare.

## Notes
- For Windows Server 2022 and later, ensure that the scanning account has one of the following group memberships: Administrator, Access Control Assistance Operators, or Server Operator.
- If encountering similar access issues, verify the group memberships and local security policies to ensure compliance with the latest requirements.
- The customer also reported a parsing tags error when running full privileged scans, which was acknowledged as a warning that does not hinder the job from completing successfully.
