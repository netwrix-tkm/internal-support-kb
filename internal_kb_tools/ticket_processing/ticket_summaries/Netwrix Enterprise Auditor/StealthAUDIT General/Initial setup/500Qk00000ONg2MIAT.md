## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ONg2MIAT
- **Case Number:** 442984
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bank of America Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Gregory Meyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the compliance of service account passwords with a mandate requiring a minimum length of 25 characters, complexity (mixed-case), and the inclusion of specific special characters.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using **StealthAUDIT V11.5** from **STEALTHbits Technologies, Inc**.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support technician requested clarification on whether the issue was specific to Netwrix Access Analyzer or involved other Netwrix applications.
2. The customer was asked to run a PowerShell command to check the installed software versions:
   ```powershell
   Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like "Stealth*" -or $_.Name -like "Netwrix*" -or $_.Name -like "Postg*" -or $_.Name -like "Python*")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```
3. The technician confirmed that the complexity of the password should not be an issue with StealthAUDIT, but noted that Windows may have restrictions on certain characters.
4. The technician advised the customer to upgrade from version 11.5 to at least version 11.6 for better compliance and functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was not with the Netwrix application itself but rather with the customer's implementation of password policies in Windows/Active Directory, which may restrict certain characters.

## Solution
The support team confirmed that there were no inherent issues with the complexity requirements of the passwords in StealthAUDIT. The customer was advised to configure the password settings according to their Windows/Active Directory requirements. Additionally, the technician recommended upgrading to version 11.6 for improved compatibility and features.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to ensure their Windows/Active Directory settings align with their password policy requirements.
- Upgrading to the latest version of the software is strongly recommended to avoid potential issues with compliance and functionality.
