## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple issues with a new implementation, including an error when trying to run the job for Group Policy and a failure in the AD_WeakPasswords job due to a dictionary update issue. The Group Policy job returned an unspecified error, and all reports under that group were blank.

## Environment Details
- The application server had no internet connection, which affected the dictionary update for the AD_WeakPasswords job.
- The AD_PasswordsPolicies job required domain admin privileges to run successfully.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed error messages related to the Group Policy job and the AD_WeakPasswords job.
2. Attempted to run the AD_WeakPasswords job, which failed due to a dictionary update error.
3. Investigated the LDAP Data Collector configuration and permissions required for the AD_PasswordsPolicies job.
4. Communicated with the customer regarding the need for domain admin credentials and internet access for dictionary updates.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issues was the lack of an internet connection on the application server, which prevented the dictionary update for the AD_WeakPasswords job. Additionally, the AD_PasswordsPolicies job required domain admin privileges to access the LDAP Data Collector and target the Domain Controller (DC).

## Solution
- Manually downloaded the dictionary for the AD_WeakPasswords job to resolve the dictionary update error.
- Configured a connection profile using credentials with domain admin privileges to resolve the connection issues with the AD_PasswordsPolicies job.

## Notes
- Ensure that the application server has internet access for dictionary updates in the future.
- Always use a connection profile with domain admin privileges when configuring jobs that require access to the LDAP Data Collector.
- For ongoing issues, consider reaching out to the professional services team for a full health check and implementation support.
