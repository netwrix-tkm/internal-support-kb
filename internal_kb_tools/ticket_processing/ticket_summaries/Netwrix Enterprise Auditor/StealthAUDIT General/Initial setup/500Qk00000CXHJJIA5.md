## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CXHJJIA5
- **Case Number:** 413649
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Atlas Air
- **Contact Name:** Duane Jarrett
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported a vulnerability detected by their monitoring tools in the Stealth Audit version 11.5.1355.1197, specifically regarding insecure Windows service permissions for the files `VaultService.exe` and `WebServer.exe`.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows (specific version not provided)
- **Stealth Audit Version:** 11.5.1355.1197

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide screenshots of the Access settings and Application settings in the Stealth Audit console.
2. The support team requested the customer to remove all entries under the Access tab and rerun the vulnerability scan.
3. The customer was informed that the permissions displayed (Read & Execute, Read & Modify) were due to users being in the administrator group.
4. A meeting was scheduled to discuss the findings and clarify any concerns regarding the permissions.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the configuration of user permissions within the Stealth Audit application. Users in the administrator group were granted extensive permissions, which led to the vulnerability being flagged.

## Solution
The support team clarified that the permissions were expected due to the users' roles. They explained that if users were only assigned as Report Viewers or Job Viewers, they would only have limited permissions (Read & Execute and Read). The customer was advised that changing the permissions for `WebServer.exe` and `VaultService.exe` would not impact the functionality of the AIC (Audit Intelligence Center).

## Notes
- It is important to regularly review user permissions in the Stealth Audit application to ensure compliance with security best practices.
- Users should be assigned roles that align with their responsibilities to minimize unnecessary permissions.
- Future configurations should consider the implications of user roles on system security to avoid similar vulnerabilities.
