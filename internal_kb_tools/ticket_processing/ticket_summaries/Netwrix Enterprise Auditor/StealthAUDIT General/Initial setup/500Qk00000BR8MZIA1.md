- **Case Number:** 410966
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago
- **Contact Name:** Michelle Clarke
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after an upgrade, they were not receiving email alerts from Netwrix Auditor, specifically for stale users and weak passwords reports.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor platform, version 11.6.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the notification settings in the AIC (Auditor Integration Console).
2. Discovered that the mail server information was missing.
3. Added the missing mail server information and sent a test email, which was successfully delivered.
4. Reviewed the Weak Password job and found it was pointing to the wrong host list.
5. Changed the host list to match the Active Directory Integration (ADI) job.
6. Noted that the Weak Password job failed to update the dictionary automatically and collected logs for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was the absence of mail server information in the notification settings, which prevented email alerts from being sent. Additionally, the Weak Password job was misconfigured to point to an incorrect host list.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding the correct mail server information to the notification settings, allowing email alerts to be sent successfully.
- Correcting the host list for the Weak Password job to align with the ADI job, ensuring proper functionality.

## Notes
- The Weak Password job requires internet access to automatically update its dictionary. If the server does not have internet access, the dictionary will not update.
- For future cases, ensure that all necessary configurations are verified after upgrades, particularly mail server settings and job configurations.
