## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KjO13IAF
- **Case Number:** 432552
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bank of America Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Gregory Meyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer was attempting to create a job that deletes files but encountered issues with the delete action not functioning as expected. Despite the job running without errors, no files were being deleted.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial meeting set up to discuss the delete action requirements.
2. Fixed RowKey and Row GUID columns were implemented.
3. Action logs were gathered to analyze the job execution.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue with specific job configurations (1-22).
5. Reviewed the action configuration to ensure it was targeting the correct elements.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an incorrect configuration in the job setup. The delete action was targeting the path instead of the specific file.

## Solution
The resolution involved changing the job configuration to ensure that the action targeted the file directly rather than the path. This adjustment allowed the delete action to function correctly, resulting in successful file deletions.

## Notes
- Ensure that future configurations for delete actions explicitly target files rather than paths to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly review action logs for any discrepancies or errors during job execution to facilitate quicker troubleshooting.
