## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O4PGXIA3
- **Case Number:** 442091
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** St Margarets Hospice
- **Contact Name:** Liam Rice
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer
- **Component:** SQL Database Support
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) supports using Azure SQL Database as a backend for their new instance, as the existing instance runs on an on-premise SQL Database Server. They were looking for documentation regarding this setup.

## Environment Details
- Existing instance: On-premise SQL Database Server
- New instance: Intended to use Azure SQL Database
- Relevant SQL Server versions: SQL Server 2016 through SQL Server 2022, Azure SQL Managed Instances

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customerâ€™s inquiry regarding Azure SQL Database support for NAA.
2. Consulted the Netwrix Access Analyzer help center for the latest SQL Server requirements.
3. Confirmed that both Azure SQL Managed Instances and SQL Server versions 2016 to 2022 are supported.
4. Verified that the server must have a US English language installation.

## Root Cause
The customer was unclear about the compatibility of Azure SQL Database with the Netwrix Access Analyzer, as the existing documentation primarily focused on on-premise SQL servers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the Netwrix Access Analyzer does support Azure SQL Database as a backend. The following points were communicated to the customer:
- NAA supports SQL Server versions 2016 through 2022 and Azure SQL Managed Instances.
- The server must be installed with the US English language.
- Both a VM in Azure running SQL Server and an Azure SQL Managed Instance are suitable options.

## Notes
- Ensure that future documentation includes clear references to Azure SQL Database support to avoid similar inquiries.
- Always verify language installation requirements when setting up SQL servers for NAA.
