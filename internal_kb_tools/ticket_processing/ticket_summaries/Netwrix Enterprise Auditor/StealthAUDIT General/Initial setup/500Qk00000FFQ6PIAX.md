## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FFQ6PIAX
- **Case Number:** 419789
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Westpac Banking Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Mark Chambers
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue executing jobs after migrating their production database for StealthAudit from a Windows 2012 SQL server to a Windows 2022 SQL server.

## Environment Details
- **Previous SQL Server:** Windows 2012
- **New SQL Server:** Windows 2022
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide appropriate SQL permissions for the Active Directory (AD) account used for Windows authentication.
2. A screenshare session was requested to review the setup and permissions.
3. The SQL team was informed about the access cut to the old database, which was causing errors during the Storage Profile change in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the customer not providing the necessary SQL permissions for the Active Directory account used for Windows authentication after the database migration.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the appropriate SQL permissions were granted to the AD account. Once the permissions were set correctly, the host management and jobs began functioning properly.

## Notes
- It is important to verify SQL permissions for AD accounts when migrating databases to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Ensure that access to the old database is managed properly during migration to prevent errors related to Storage Profile changes.
