- **Case Number:** 428930
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wipro
- **Contact Name:** Baskar Velu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the impact of resizing their virtual machine configuration from Standard_D64ds_v5 to Standard_D48ds_v5, seeking confirmation that the changes would not adversely affect their operations.

## Environment Details
- **Current Configuration:** Standard_D64ds_v5 (64 vCPUs, 256 GiB RAM)
- **Proposed Configuration:** Standard_D48ds_v5 (48 vCPUs, 192 GiB RAM)
- **Context:** Pre-configured setups for virtual machines.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the specifications of both Standard_D64ds_v5 and Standard_D48ds_v5 configurations.
2. Confirmed that the proposed configuration (Standard_D48ds_v5) meets all operational requirements for the customer's collectors.
3. Provided guidance on the expected performance and resource availability post-resizing.

## Root Cause
The inquiry stemmed from the customer's concern about potential performance degradation after reducing the VM's resources from a higher to a lower configuration, despite the new configuration still meeting their operational requirements.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the Standard_D48ds_v5 configuration would adequately support the customer's needs. It was explained that both configurations were within the recommended specifications for all collectors used by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, ensuring no negative impact on performance.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that any configuration changes are thoroughly evaluated against the operational requirements of the customer's environment.
- Future inquiries regarding VM resizing should include a review of the specific requirements for the collectors in use to provide accurate guidance.
