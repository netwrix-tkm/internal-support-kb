- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NfE6eIAF
- **Case Number:** 440919
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
- **Contact Name:** Mike Gaetano
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The FSAA job was generating errors immediately after starting, specifically indicating that permissions were not found. The job did not complete its scan when scheduled, which prevented subsequent jobs from executing.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Age:** 11.2

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to upload the debug log for the FSAA job.
2. Conducted a meeting to review the permission scan and identified errors related to the network not being found and hosts being offline.
3. Set permissions and activity jobs to debug mode for closer monitoring.
4. Advised the customer to monitor the job during its next scheduled run and collect logs for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The FSAA job errors occurred because the job did not complete the scan due to network issues and permission errors, which caused it to stop prematurely.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by rerunning the scan after addressing the identified permission and network issues. The job ran successfully without errors during its next scheduled execution.

## Notes
- Ensure that network connectivity and permissions are verified before scheduling jobs to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to keep debug logging enabled temporarily during troubleshooting to capture detailed logs for analysis.
