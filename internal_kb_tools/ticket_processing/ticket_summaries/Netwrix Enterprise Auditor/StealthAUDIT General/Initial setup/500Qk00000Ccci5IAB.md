## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ccci5IAB
- **Case Number:** 413920
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Carlstar Group LLC (formerly CTP Carlisle Transportation Products)
- **Contact Name:** James Lilley
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the database (DB) size and log file size for StealthAUDIT had recently grown very large, requiring assistance to address the issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within a SQL Server environment.
- The customer was using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically the StealthAUDIT component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer requested the output from a PowerShell script to gather information about the installed versions of Netwrix/Stealth applications.
2. The engineer instructed the customer to run specific TSQL commands in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to assess the database size and log file usage:
   ```sql
   SET NOCOUNT ON
   DBCC UPDATEUSAGE(0)
   EXEC sp_spaceused
   SELECT
       t.name AS TableName,
       s.name AS SchemaName,
       p.rows,
       SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 AS TotalSpaceKB,
       CAST(ROUND(((SUM(a.total_pages) * 8) / 1024.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS TotalSpaceMB,
       SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 AS UsedSpaceKB,
       CAST(ROUND(((SUM(a.used_pages) * 8) / 1024.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS UsedSpaceMB,
       (SUM(a.total_pages) - SUM(a.used_pages)) * 8 AS UnusedSpaceKB,
       CAST(ROUND(((SUM(a.total_pages) - SUM(a.used_pages)) * 8) / 1024.00, 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS UnusedSpaceMB
   FROM
       sys.tables t
   INNER JOIN     
       sys.indexes i ON t.object_id = i.object_id
   INNER JOIN
       sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.object_id AND i.index_id = p.index_id
   INNER JOIN
       sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
   LEFT OUTER JOIN
       sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id
   WHERE
       t.name NOT LIKE 'dt%'
       AND t.is_ms_shipped = 0
       AND i.object_id > 255 
   GROUP BY
       t.name, s.name, p.rows
   ORDER BY
       TotalSpaceMB DESC, t.name
   ```
3. The customer was advised to save the output as CSV files for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by SQL Server logging being set to "Full" recovery mode instead of "Simple." This configuration led to excessive growth of the database and log files.

## Solution
The resolution involved changing the SQL Server database recovery model from "Full" to "Simple." This adjustment prevents the log file from growing indefinitely and helps manage the database size more effectively.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the recovery model settings in SQL Server to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be advised to regularly check database sizes and log file growth, especially after significant changes in data volume or application usage.
- If the issue recurs, consider reviewing the database's backup and maintenance plans to ensure they align with the organization's data retention and recovery requirements.
