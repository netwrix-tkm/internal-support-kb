- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad
- **Contact Name:** Ganesan Ramulu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on changing the database owner for NV Monitor Config, NV Monitor Data, and Stealth AUDIT from `sqlservice` to `sqladmin/e2psa` due to a gap identified in a CCS report during infrastructure hardening. The customer was concerned about potential impacts on server performance.

## Environment Details
- **Database Server:** MSSQLSERVER
- **Current DB Owner:** sqlservice
- **Proposed DB Owner:** sqladmin/e2psa
- **Authentication Method:** Windows authentication

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer provided details about the current database owner and the proposed change.
2. Support inquired about the version and build of the software.
3. Support confirmed that the database owner was assigned during the installation of StealthAUDIT/StealthINTERCEPT.
4. Support advised that changing the database owner should not affect scheduled jobs if the user remains unchanged.
5. The customer communicated concerns about potential impacts on Stealthbit applications if the database owner was changed.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a compliance requirement identified during a CCS scan, which flagged the current database owner as a security gap. The customer needed clarification on the implications of changing the database owner.

## Solution
Support confirmed that changing the database owner would not impact server performance or scheduled jobs, provided that the user assigned to the database remained the same. The customer was advised to proceed with the change if they were not altering the user under the database.

## Notes
- It is recommended to keep the same database owner to avoid any unforeseen issues with application functionality.
- Always inform the compliance department of any changes to database ownership to assess potential impacts on applications.
- Ensure that backups are taken before making changes to database configurations.
