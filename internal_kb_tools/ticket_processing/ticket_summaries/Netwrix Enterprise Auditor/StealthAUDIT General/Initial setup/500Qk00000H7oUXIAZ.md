## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H7oUXIAZ
- **Case Number:** 424159
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Optimum Informatique Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Pierre-luc Therrien
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** T2 Database
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the disk space on their Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server was almost full, with 400GB of the 430GB disk being occupied by FSAA scans. The customer was uncertain if this was normal, as they believed that all scan data should be stored in the database and not locally on the server.

## Environment Details
- **Server Disk Size:** 430GB
- **Current Disk Usage:** 400GB occupied by FSAA scans
- **Database Location:** T2 database resides on the local server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the size of the T2 database and its location on the local server.
2. Reviewed the customer's screenshots of the FSAA system scans.
3. Discussed the duration of scans (40+ hours) and potential performance issues.
4. Identified error messages related to folder names containing spaces.
5. Scheduled meetings to discuss the issues in detail.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the normal operation of the T2 database, which resides on the local server and can occupy significant disk space. The customer was not aware that the database would retain data locally, leading to confusion regarding disk usage.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to add additional disk space to their server. It was explained that it is normal for the T2 database to remain on the local server and that they should consider doubling their disk space to accommodate the database size.

## Notes
- It is important for customers to understand that the T2 database will occupy space on the local server, which may lead to disk space issues if not monitored.
- Customers should regularly check disk usage and plan for additional storage as needed to prevent similar issues in the future.
