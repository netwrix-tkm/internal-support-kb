## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I7zFhIAJ
- **Case Number:** 426596
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BDO Israel
- **Contact Name:** Adam Deis
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6.0.62

## Problem Description
The customer, BDO Israel, inquired about the necessary preparations for migrating to a new NetApp machine (A70) with the CDOT 9.15.1 operating system. They sought guidance on any special considerations or configurations needed for their current version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (11.6.0.62).

## Environment Details
- Current NetApp OS: CDOT 9.15.1
- Current Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version: 11.6.0.62

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer's planned migration to the new NetApp machine.
2. Reviewed the compatibility of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor with the new NetApp OS version.
3. Provided information regarding deprecated features in the new NetApp OS.
4. Clarified the requirements for hosting Enterprise Auditor on Windows Server.

## Root Cause
The inquiry stemmed from the customer's need to ensure compatibility and proper configuration of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor with the new NetApp machine and its operating system, particularly regarding deprecated features and necessary updates.

## Solution
The resolution involved advising the customer that after deploying the new NetApp machine, they needed to:
- Update the configurations of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Activity Monitor (if used) to reflect the changes in their infrastructure.
- Note that the Resiliency feature was deprecated in favor of the Persistent Store feature, which allows for event caching if fPolicy fails to send events. If configured, Netwrix Activity Monitor would automatically scan the persistent store for unsent events.

For further details on configuring Persistent Store, the customer was directed to consult with NetApp Support.

## Notes
- The Resiliency feature introduced in ONTAP 9.0 is not supported.
- Ensure that the server hosting Enterprise Auditor is a Windows Server (2012 through 2022) and meets the language and domain membership requirements.
- Future migrations should consider the compatibility of features between different versions of NetApp OS and Netwrix products.
