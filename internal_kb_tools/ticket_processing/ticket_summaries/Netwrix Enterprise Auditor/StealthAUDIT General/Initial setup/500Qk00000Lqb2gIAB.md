- **Case Number:** 435771
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cowen & Company
- **Contact Name:** Terry Asson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) could utilize a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for SQL connections.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 127

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the capability of using a gMSA account for NEA to write to SQL.
2. Advised the customer to set the storage account to Windows Authentication.
3. Recommended setting the Schedule account to the gMSA.
4. Explained the requirement for the account used to launch the NEA console to have SQL access.
5. Suggested granting SQL access to a group that includes the accounts managing the NEA console.
6. Informed the customer that the account signed into the NEA console must be included in the gMSA's `PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword` to successfully save the connection profile.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of clarity regarding the configuration of gMSA accounts for SQL connections within the NEA environment, particularly concerning permissions and access requirements.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that a gMSA can indeed be used for SQL connections with NEA. The customer was guided to:
- Set the storage account to Windows Authentication.
- Configure the Schedule account to use the gMSA.
- Ensure that the account used to access the NEA console has the necessary SQL permissions and is included in the gMSA's allowed principals.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the account used to launch the NEA console has SQL access to avoid connection issues.
- Always verify that the gMSA's `PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword` includes the account used to sign into the NEA console to prevent failures in saving connection profiles.
- The customer indicated they would not be able to continue working on this until later in the year and requested to close the ticket.
