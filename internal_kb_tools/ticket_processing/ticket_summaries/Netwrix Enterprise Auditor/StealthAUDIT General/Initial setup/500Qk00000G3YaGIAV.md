- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Axos Bank
- **Contact Name:** Alan A. Moreno
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the PermissionScan feature was failing for seven hosts, which had been functioning correctly the previous day. The error message received was: 
```
"Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in use and max pool size was reached."
```
The customer inquired about modifying the maximum pool size or preventing this issue from recurring.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message and confirmed it was consistent across the affected hosts.
2. Checked the connection pool settings to determine the current maximum pool size.
3. Reviewed logs for any additional errors or warnings that could provide insight into the connection pool usage.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue by running PermissionScan on the affected hosts.
5. Monitored the system for any changes or improvements after initial troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not identified during the troubleshooting process. It was noted that the problem resolved itself after a week of normal job execution without further incidents.

## Solution
The issue was resolved without any specific intervention. After a week of running jobs, the PermissionScan feature began functioning normally again for the affected hosts. The ticket was closed at the customer's request, as the problem did not reoccur.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the connection pool usage regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing alerts for connection pool thresholds to proactively manage potential timeout issues.
- If the issue resurfaces, further investigation into the connection pool configuration and usage patterns may be necessary.
