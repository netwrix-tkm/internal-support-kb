- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in removing data for old or decommissioned hosts that are no longer scanned. They encountered a "Foreign Key constraint" error when attempting to use the FS_DropTables job for this purpose.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The issue was related to the FSAA (File System Audit and Analysis) component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a meeting with the customer to discuss the requirements and limitations of the FS_DropTables job.
2. Explained that the FS_DropTables job would remove all File System solution data, which was not suitable for the customer's needs.
3. Suggested using the "remove host data" query instead.
4. Created a static host list by executing the following SQL query:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [J4D_StealthAudit_AEM].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_Hosts]
   WHERE ScanTime < '2024-12-01 00:00:00'
   ORDER BY ScanTime;
   ```
5. Configured the static host list in the "Hosts" settings for the newly created "DropFSHostData" job.
6. Initiated the "DropFSHostData" job and monitored its progress.

## Root Cause
The initial attempt to use the FS_DropTables job failed due to foreign key constraints in the database, which prevented the deletion of data associated with the specified hosts.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating a custom job named "DropFSHostData" that specifically targeted the hosts eligible for data removal based on their last scan date. The job was successfully executed, and the FSAA-related data for the specified hosts was removed without encountering any errors.

## Notes
- The "DropFSHostData" job must be run in "Interactive mode," meaning the NEA console must remain open during execution to prevent termination.
- Future requests for data removal should consider using the "remove host data" query to avoid issues with foreign key constraints.
- A separate ticket was opened to address an unrelated "OutOfMemoryException" error encountered during a different job execution, indicating potential memory issues on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
