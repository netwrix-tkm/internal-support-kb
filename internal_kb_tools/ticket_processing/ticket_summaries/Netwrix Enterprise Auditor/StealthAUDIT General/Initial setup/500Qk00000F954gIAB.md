- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported errors while attempting to scan a new Entra ID source after dropping an old domain. The scan was unsuccessful due to permission issues with the user ID associated with the new domain.

## Environment Details
- The old and new domains have a one-way trust relationship.
- The user ID from the old domain was initially used to scan the new domain.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the setup for StealthAUDIT and identified that the connection profile was using the account the customer logged in with.
2. Advised the customer to create a dedicated service account for launching the application and running jobs.
3. Noted that the customer needed additional permissions to query the new Domain Controller (DC).
4. Suggested the customer contact their admin to ensure the user ID is a member of the domain admin group for the DC they want to query.
5. Recommended contacting the Azure admin to clarify permission access levels.

## Root Cause
The user ID for the new domain was not functioning due to insufficient permissions. The old domain was dropped, and the user ID from the old domain was used, which had the necessary permissions to access the new domain.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by dropping the old domain and utilizing the user ID from the old domain to scan the new domain. This approach worked because the user ID had the required permissions to perform the scan, despite the new domain's user ID lacking sufficient access.

## Notes
- Ensure that any service accounts used for scanning have the appropriate permissions to access the necessary resources.
- It is advisable to maintain clear documentation of trust relationships between domains to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly review and update permissions for service accounts to ensure they meet the requirements for accessing new resources.
