- **Case Number:** 435546
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Wipro
- **Contact Name:** Baskar Velu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that server utilization was less than the actual compute configuration, leading to a recommendation to reduce the size of the server configuration. They inquired about the feasibility of changing from a Standard_D48ads_v5 to a Standard_D32ads_v5 configuration.

## Environment Details
- **Current Configuration:** Standard_D48ads_v5
- **Recommended Configuration:** Standard_D32ads_v5
- **vCPUs:** Decreases from 48 to 32
- **RAM:** Decreases from 192 GiB to 128 GiB
- **Temporary Storage:** Decreases from 1,800 GiB to 1,200 GiB

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the server utilization metrics to confirm the recommendation for size reduction.
2. Analyzed the specifications of the current and recommended configurations.
3. Updated the ticket with steps to reproduce the inquiry regarding server setup types.
4. Awaited customer input for confirmation on the feasibility of the configuration change.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the inquiry was identified as the server's underutilization compared to its current compute configuration, prompting the recommendation for a size reduction.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the recommended configuration (Standard_D32ads_v5) would sufficiently meet the software requirements. Since there was no response from the customer, it was assumed they had enough information to proceed with the change.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor server utilization regularly to ensure configurations align with actual usage.
- Future inquiries regarding configuration changes should include a detailed analysis of current utilization metrics to support recommendations.
- Always confirm with the customer before proceeding with significant changes to server configurations.
