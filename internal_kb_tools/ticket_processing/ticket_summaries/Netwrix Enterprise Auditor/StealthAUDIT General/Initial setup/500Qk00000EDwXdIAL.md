## Problem Description
The customer sought guidance on updating certificates for the StealthAudit application after their internal Certificate Authority (CA) issued a new root certificate. They were concerned that any existing certificates would soon become non-functional and needed assistance with re-issuing certificates using the updated root CA.

2. The support technician reviewed the situation and confirmed that there was no actual certificate issue present.
3. The technician communicated with the customer to clarify the misunderstanding regarding the certificates.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the ticket was a misunderstanding by the customer regarding the status of their certificates. They believed there was an issue due to the new root CA but later realized that their existing certificates were still functional.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying to the customer that there was no certificate issue. The support team confirmed that the certificates were functioning correctly and closed the ticket as solved.

## Notes
- Customers should be encouraged to verify the status of their certificates before assuming there is an issue, especially after changes in the CA.
- It may be beneficial to provide documentation or guidance on how to check certificate validity and functionality to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future.
