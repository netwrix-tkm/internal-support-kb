- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup

## Problem Description
The customer reported blocking issues in the Stealthbits database on the server PGCOITDATA21, which could potentially block other processes for up to 24 hours. The customer was uncertain about the extent of the blocking's impact on the application.

## Environment Details
- **Server:** PGCOITDATA21
- **Database:** Stealthbits database

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted an investigation into possible causes for SQL statements being blocked or deadlocked.
2. Identified that multiple transactions could be occurring simultaneously, leading to deadlocks and blocking.
3. Suggested the customer identify which jobs were running on the NEA server that might be causing the issue.
4. Offered to schedule a meeting for further discussion and investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the blocking was identified as multiple transactions occurring before one could complete, which resulted in deadlocks and blocking situations.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to investigate the running jobs on their SQL server and to monitor for any errors that might be prompted on the NEA server. The customer was informed that they could reopen the ticket if further assistance was needed after their investigation.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to perform further investigation into their SQL server and related SQL scripts.
- The ticket was closed at the customer's request, with the option to reopen within 30 days if necessary.
- It is important for future cases to monitor job executions and their interactions to prevent similar blocking issues.
