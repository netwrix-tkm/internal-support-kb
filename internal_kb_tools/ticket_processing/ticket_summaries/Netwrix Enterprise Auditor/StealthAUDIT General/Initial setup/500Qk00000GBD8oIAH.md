## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GBD8oIAH
- **Case Number:** 421923
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** East Lancashire NHS Trust
- **Contact Name:** Gary Atherton
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their SQL Server was continuously filling up due to the growing size of the StealthAUDIT database. They had implemented a script to purge data for NVmonitorData down to 7 months but needed a solution to manage the size of the StealthAUDIT database to free up disk space.

## Environment Details
- **SQL Server Version:** Not specified
- **Netwrix Product Version:** 11.5
- **Data Collection Tool:** StealthAUDIT

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current database size and growth patterns.
2. Investigated existing settings related to data retention for StealthAUDIT.
3. Explored options for purging older detections or adjusting retention settings.
4. Recommended expanding disk drive sizes for NEA, NTP (SI), and NTM (SD).
5. Suggested excluding the "dsm_ism_srvmgr.exe" process from the "LSASS Guardian" policy to reduce event noise.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was insufficient hardware resources and the lack of appropriate settings to manage the retention of data within the StealthAUDIT database, leading to excessive growth.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following actions were taken:
- Expanded the disk drive sizes for the recommended values for NEA, NTP (SI), and NTM (SD).
- Excluded the "dsm_ism_srvmgr.exe" process from the "LSASS Guardian" policy, which significantly reduced event noise and positively affected the database size.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly monitor the database size and adjust retention settings as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing automated scripts for purging older data to maintain optimal disk space usage.
- Ensure that any processes that generate excessive events are reviewed and managed to avoid unnecessary database growth.
