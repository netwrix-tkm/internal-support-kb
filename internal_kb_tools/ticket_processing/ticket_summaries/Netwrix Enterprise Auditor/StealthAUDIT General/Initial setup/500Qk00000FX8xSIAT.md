## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FX8xSIAT
- **Case Number:** 420465
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Damus Aulu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a disk space alert for their SQL Server data drive, indicating that the `tempdb` and `StealthAudit` databases were consuming excessive disk space (1.2 TB and 1.3 TB, respectively). The objective was to reclaim space by trimming or purging stale data within these databases.

## Environment Details
- **SQL Server Version:** Not specified
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** 11.6
- **Disk Drive:** E: drive

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the disk space usage of the `tempdb` and `StealthAudit` databases.
2. Created a zSandBox job for FSAA Drop Data in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
   - Navigation: `Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Data Collectors > FileSystemAccess Data Collector > FSAA: Query Selection > Maintenance options: Remove Host Data`
3. Created a new host list (Drop host list) via the Import option, pointing to a temporary text file.
   - Navigation: `Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Host Management > Host Management Activities > Import Hosts Option`
4. Executed a TSQL query to spot check for remnants of the host:
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM SA_FSAA_ResourcesView  
   WHERE HostName Like '<HOST IN QUESTION>%'
   ```
5. Advised the DBAs to shrink the database after the cleanup to recover disk space.

## Root Cause
The excessive disk space usage was caused by old data in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor SQL database related to hosts that were no longer active.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by purging stale data from the `StealthAudit` database using the zSandBox job for FSAA Drop Data. After the cleanup was completed, the DBAs were able to shrink the database, successfully reclaiming the necessary disk space.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly monitor disk usage and adjust retention settings for data collectors to prevent similar issues in the future.
- For identifying large tables consuming disk space, use the following method in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
  - Right-click the NEA database > Reports > Standard Reports > Disk Usage by Top Tables.
- FSAC (File System Access Collector) is often a significant contributor to disk space usage; consider reviewing its retention settings.
