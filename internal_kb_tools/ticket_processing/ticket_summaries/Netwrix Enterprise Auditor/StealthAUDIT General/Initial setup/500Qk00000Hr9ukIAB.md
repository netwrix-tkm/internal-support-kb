## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hr9ukIAB
- **Case Number:** 425913
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Independent Bank
- **Contact Name:** Shawn Pratt
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they had an old version of Java installed on their server and wanted to confirm whether Java was required for the Netwrix product they were using. They expressed a desire to remove the old Java installation if it was not necessary.

## Environment Details
- **Java Version:** Old version installed (specific version not provided)
- **Netwrix Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the product documentation to determine Java requirements.
2. Confirmed that Java is used for Sensitive Data but is embedded within the Netwrix product itself.
3. Communicated with the customer to clarify that the installed Java version on their machine does not affect the functionality of the Netwrix product.

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from the customer's understanding of Java's role in the Netwrix product. While Java is utilized for Sensitive Data processing, it is embedded in the product and does not rely on the external Java installation on the customer's server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that:
- The Java installation on their server is not required for the Netwrix product.
- They can safely uninstall the old version of Java without impacting the functionality of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify to customers that embedded components within a product may not require external installations of the same technology.
- Future inquiries regarding Java requirements should emphasize the distinction between embedded usage and external installations to avoid similar confusion.
