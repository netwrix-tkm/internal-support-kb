- **Case Number:** 428230
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KPMG Management Services LP
- **Contact Name:** Jason Skidmore
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Initial setup
- **Feature:** Setup assistance
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they have access to Netwrix Auditor but were unable to set it up after downloading it. They requested assistance with the setup process.

## Environment Details
The customer is licensed for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT) and Netwrix Activity Monitor, not for Netwrix Auditor.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's account to check licensing details.
2. Confirmed that the customer does not have a license for Netwrix Auditor.
3. Informed the customer about the capabilities of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor regarding Active Directory activity auditing, including account lockout reporting.
4. Suggested the use of the freeware tool, Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner, for additional assistance in investigations.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the licensing of Netwrix products. The customer believed they had access to Netwrix Auditor, while they were actually licensed for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which includes similar functionalities.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the differences between Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The customer was informed that they could use the existing Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to generate account lockout reports without needing to set up Netwrix Auditor. Additionally, the customer was provided with information about the Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner as a potential tool for their needs.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify product licensing and capabilities to avoid confusion between different Netwrix products.
- The Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner is a freeware tool that can assist in investigations but is not officially supported by Netwrix. Documentation is available for reference.
