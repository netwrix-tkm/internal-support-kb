- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that they were not receiving file share activity information following a server change and an upgrade to version 11.5. They suspected that the necessary jobs were either not enabled or failing.

## Environment Details
- The issue arose after a server change and upgrade to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5.
- The customer is located in Ohio, USA.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a call with the customer to discuss the issue.
2. Reviewed the FSAC system scan job results, which completed with warnings.
3. Identified that the warning indicated a network path was not found.
4. Investigated the account used to access the activity log and its permissions.
5. Discovered that the file path was incorrectly assigned to the agent monitoring the activity.
6. Updated the file path to the correct one.
7. Ran the FSAC system scan job again to verify if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was twofold:
- The FSAC system scan job completed with warnings due to an incorrect file path assignment.
- The account used to access the activity log did not have proper access to the specified file path.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correcting the file path assigned to the agent monitoring the activity.
- Ensuring that the account used for accessing the activity log had the necessary permissions.
- Running the FSAC system scan job again, which successfully scanned the host without errors.

## Notes
- It is important to verify file paths and account permissions after server changes or upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Future cases may require a review of the FSAC system scan job settings and the associated agents to ensure proper configuration.
- If similar warnings occur, check for network path accessibility and correct file path assignments promptly.
