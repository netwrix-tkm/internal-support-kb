- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Catharine Coleman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the application identity for Honeywell users needed to be integrated with either the enterprise LDAP/AD service or the Honeywell SSO service. This integration is essential for centralized identity and access management, secure administration, resource management, scalability, and high availability.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the integration requirements for Honeywell users with LDAP/AD and SSO services.
2. Consulted the Netwrix documentation regarding SSO support.
3. Confirmed that the necessary configurations for SSO integration were not in place.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a lack of proper integration setup between the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Honeywell SSO service or enterprise LDAP/AD service.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that SSO is supported by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The customer was directed to the relevant documentation for SSO integration, specifically the section on Okta integration, which provides detailed steps for setting up the required configurations.

## Notes
- Ensure that all future integrations with third-party systems like Honeywell SSO are thoroughly documented and that the necessary configurations are verified before deployment.
- It is important to keep the documentation updated and accessible for quick reference during similar cases.
