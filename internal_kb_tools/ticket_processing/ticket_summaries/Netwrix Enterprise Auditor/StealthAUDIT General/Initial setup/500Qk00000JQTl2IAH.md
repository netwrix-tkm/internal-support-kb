## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JQTl2IAH
- **Case Number:** 429711
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Damus Aulu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where configuring a host on a seek job resulted in duplicated jobs that replaced individual hosts with the last edited host across multiple scans (scan_v2, scan_v3, and scan_v4). This behavior persisted even when different hosts were assigned to the scans.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 122
- **Installation Path:** `E:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration of the seek jobs and their associated hosts.
2. Attempted to configure scan_v3 with a different host, but the changes replicated to scan_v2 and scan_v4.
3. Suspected that the .xml files associated with the copied jobs were not updating correctly.
4. Cleared out the initial job copies from the left menu, which also removed data from the SQL backend.
5. Copied the canned job from the installation folder to the jobs folder.
6. Closed the NEA Console and reopened it.
7. Renamed the copied job and its .xml file with the appropriate region abbreviation.
8. Adjusted the Concurrent Worker Threads from the default of 10 to 4 based on developer recommendations.
9. Updated the necessary scoping for the scan.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified; however, it was suspected that the .xml files associated with the copied jobs were not updating correctly, leading to the console displaying the last edited host for all duplicated jobs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting the initial job copies to clear the incorrect configurations.
- Copying and renaming the canned job and its .xml file to ensure they were correctly configured for each host.
- Adjusting the Concurrent Worker Threads and updating the scan scoping as needed.

## Notes
- If similar issues arise in the future, it may be beneficial to check the .xml file configurations for any discrepancies.
- Consider documenting the steps taken to resolve this issue for future reference, especially regarding the handling of job copies and their configurations.
