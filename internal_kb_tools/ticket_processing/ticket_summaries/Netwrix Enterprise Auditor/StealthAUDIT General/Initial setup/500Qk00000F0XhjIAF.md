## Root Cause
The initial issue stemmed from errors related to the installation of the Microsoft Graph Module, which prevented the successful setup of the Azure Inventory job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Manually creating the secret key for the Entra ID Inventory and ensuring the correct permissions were assigned.
- Creating a new connection profile in StealthAUDIT with the new Client ID and Key.
- Assigning this new profile to the Entra ID Inventory job, which then executed successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Microsoft Graph Module is properly installed and configured before attempting to set up the Azure Inventory job.
