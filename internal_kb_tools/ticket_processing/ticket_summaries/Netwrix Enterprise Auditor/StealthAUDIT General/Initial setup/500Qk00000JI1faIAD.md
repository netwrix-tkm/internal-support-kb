- **Case Number:** 429325

- **Account/Company:** ORIX

- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Initial setup

## Problem Description
Users were granted read-only access in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) console, but encountered an "error code 5. Access denied" message when attempting to open the console.

## Environment Details
- Users were attempting to access the NEA console.
- The issue was related to permissions at the SQL server level.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that users had been granted permission to access the NEA console.
2. Identified that users did not have the proper permissions applied at the SQL server.
3. Awaited the customerâ€™s database team to create the missing permission groups as detailed in the documentation.
4. Confirmed that the users lacked modify access to the `%SAInstallDir%`.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that users did not have the necessary permissions to the `%SAInstallDir%`, which is required for accessing the NEA console.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, modify access was added to the `%SAInstallDir%`. After this change, users were able to start the console and perform the necessary functions without encountering the access denied error.

## Notes
- Ensure that all users who require access to the NEA console have the appropriate permissions set at both the SQL server and the `%SAInstallDir%`.
- Document any changes made to user permissions for future reference and troubleshooting.
