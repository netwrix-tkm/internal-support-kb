- **Case Number:** 422842
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motiva Enterprises
- **Contact Name:** James Rigoulot
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that all of their Netwrix products were out of date and requested guidance and assistance for upgrading them.

## Environment Details
- Current versions of products:
  - Enterprise Auditor: 11.6.0.84
  - Activity Monitor: 7.0.3130
  - StealthIntercept: 7.3.9.160
  - Threat Manager: 2.8.1681.0
  - Recovery for AD: 2.5.233
- The client was using a Proof of Concept (POC) license, which allowed for licensing but not all features were utilized.
- Active services included AD, SQL, and Windows, while FS, SDD, SharePoint, and Azure were not in use.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a preflight meeting to gather necessary documentation (screenshots, logs).
2. Attempted to upgrade the AIC but encountered an error: "logonuser failed with error 1385."
   - Resolved by removing the restriction on the service account that prevented interactive logon.
3. Restarted the AIC service, which then functioned correctly.
4. Completed the upgrade for NAM without issues.
5. Attempted to install the NRAD upgrade but encountered a registration error with `SmtpNotification.comhost.dll`.
6. Confirmed account permissions and found that the SQL Server connection was missing the domain prefix, which was corrected.
7. Attempted to reinstall NRAD but faced the same registration error.

## Root Cause
The initial issue with the AIC upgrade was due to the service account not having permission to log on interactively. The NRAD installation failure was caused by incorrect SQL Server connection credentials (missing domain).

## Solution
- The AIC upgrade was successfully completed after adjusting the service account permissions.
- The NRAD installation was resolved by ensuring the SQL Server connection included the domain in the credentials.
- Further troubleshooting for NRAD was deferred to a dedicated ticket for continued investigation.

## Notes
- Ensure that service accounts have the necessary permissions for interactive logon when performing upgrades.
- Always verify that SQL Server connection credentials include the domain to avoid installation issues.
- Future upgrades should be planned with preflight checks to gather all necessary configurations and logs to streamline the process.
