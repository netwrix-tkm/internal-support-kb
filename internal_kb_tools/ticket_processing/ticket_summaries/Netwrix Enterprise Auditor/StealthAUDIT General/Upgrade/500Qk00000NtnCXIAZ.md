- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer, CoreWin Distributor, was unable to download the Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) version 12.0 installation files from the customer portal, as they did not see NAA listed in the "My Products" section. They requested assistance on how to obtain the necessary files for the upgrade and guidance on the upgrade process.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using the NFR (Not For Resale) version of Netwrix Access Analyzer in a test environment to provide proof of concept (PoC) for customers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the installation files for NAA version 12.0 should be available in the customer portal if the account has access to a valid license.
2. Suggested the customer log into the Partner Portal to check for the installation files.
3. Provided direct links to the installation files for NAA and its modules.
4. Informed the customer about the recommended upgrade path from version 11.5 to 11.6 before upgrading to 12.0.
5. Shared several articles detailing the upgrade procedure and considerations:

   - [SharePoint Agent Upgrade](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/SharePointAgent/Upgrade.htm)

## Root Cause
The customer did not have access to the installation files for NAA version 12.0 in the customer portal due to their partner status, which limited their visibility to certain products.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to the Partner Portal where they could access the necessary installation files. Additionally, the customer was provided with detailed upgrade instructions, which they followed successfully to upgrade their NAA to version 12.0.

## Notes
- It is important for partners to be aware that they may need to access the Partner Portal for installation files rather than the standard customer portal.
- When upgrading from version 11.5, it is crucial to first upgrade to version 11.6 before proceeding to version 12.0, as outlined in the upgrade documentation.
- Ensure that any old add-ons, such as the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On, are uninstalled prior to upgrading to avoid conflicts.
