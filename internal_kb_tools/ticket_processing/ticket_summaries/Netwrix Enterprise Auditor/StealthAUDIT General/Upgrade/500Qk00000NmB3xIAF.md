- **Case Number:** 441147
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** US Department of Treasury-Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
- **Contact Name:** Eugene Johnson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested a pre-flight implementation for upgrading their Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) and Access Information Center (AIC) from version 11.6 to 12.0 in the development environment, with plans to upgrade the production environment afterward.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 11.6
- **Target Version:** 12.0
- **Platforms Involved:** Netwrix Access Analyzer and Access Information Center

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a pre-flight meeting to discuss the upgrade process.
2. Reviewed settings for the NEA Development environment during the meeting.
3. Advised the customer to take snapshots of the NEA Application and SQL servers before the upgrade.
4. Instructed the customer to download necessary installation files from the Netwrix website.
5. Informed the customer to unblock the downloaded zip file before copying it to the application server.
6. Conducted the upgrade to version 12.0 in the development environment.
7. Verified functionality of the Access Analyzer and AIC post-upgrade, including single sign-on (SSO) and SSL configurations.
8. Replaced the AIC certificate binding with a new certificate and added SSO to the reporting console.

## Root Cause
The need for the upgrade was driven by the desire to enhance functionality and security features in the Netwrix Access Analyzer and Access Information Center, which were outdated at version 11.6.

## Solution
The upgrade to version 12.0 was successfully completed. Post-upgrade verification confirmed that:
- The Access Analyzer was functioning correctly.
- Single sign-on and SSL were operational in the AIC.
- The AIC certificate binding was updated with the new certificate.

## Notes
- Ensure to take snapshots of the application and SQL servers before performing upgrades to allow for easy rollback if necessary.
- Always unblock downloaded installation files before copying them to the application server to prevent installation issues.
- Future upgrades should follow a similar pre-flight process to ensure a smooth transition and minimize downtime.
