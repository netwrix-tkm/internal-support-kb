- Ensured that the PageFile was configured to use only the E: drive.
- A reboot was required to complete the installation and apply the changes.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that full admin access is available on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server during the upgrade process.
- Future communications should be conducted through the Support Portal rather than direct emails to avoid oversight.
- Always verify the latest bug fix lists and upgrade procedures from the Netwrix documentation before proceeding with upgrades.
