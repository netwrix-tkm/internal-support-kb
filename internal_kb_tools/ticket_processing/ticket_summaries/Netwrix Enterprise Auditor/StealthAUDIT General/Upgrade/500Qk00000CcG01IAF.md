- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CcG01IAF
- **Case Number:** 413894
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance to upgrade the Stealth Audit version to 11.6 on their B servers to ensure successful SQL scans.

## Environment Details
- B servers involved in the upgrade:
  - B0185-APP0699-S
  - B0185-APP0700-S
  - B0185-APP0701-S
  - B0185-APP0702-S
- Previous version: StealthAUDIT 11.5 and Access Information Center 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6 was downloaded to the B servers.
2. Advised the customer to stop any scheduled scans before proceeding with the upgrade.
3. Suggested taking server snapshots to allow rollback in case of upgrade failure.
4. Scheduled a meeting to discuss the upgrade process and address any concerns.
5. Addressed an "Unspecified Error" encountered when copying files to some servers, indicating that the issue was related to the customer's infrastructure rather than the Netwrix applications.

## Root Cause
The "Unspecified Error" encountered during the file copying process was determined to be related to the customer's infrastructure, not the Netwrix applications.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully performed on all four B servers:
- B0185-APP0699-S: Upgraded from StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6.0.83
- B0185-APP0700-S: Upgraded from StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6.0.83
- B0185-APP0701-S: Upgraded from Access Information Center 11.5 to Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6.0.21
- B0185-APP0702-S: Upgraded from Access Information Center 11.5 to Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6.0.21

## Notes
- Ensure that all scheduled scans are stopped before performing upgrades to avoid conflicts.
- Always take server snapshots prior to upgrades for rollback purposes.
- If similar errors occur, involve the customer's infrastructure team to investigate potential environmental issues.
