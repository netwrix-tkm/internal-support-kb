## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Npch7IAB
- **Case Number:** 441354
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bank of New Hampshire
- **Contact Name:** Casey Nialetz
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.5 to 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with upgrading their StealthAUDIT installation from version 11.5 to Netwrix Access Analyzer version 12.0 while planning to migrate to a new Windows server.

## Environment Details
- Current installation: StealthAUDIT 11.5.1346.1069
- Target installation: Netwrix Access Analyzer 12.0.0.1070
- SQL database location: Remains unchanged during migration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Pre-flight Check:** Completed pre-flight checks prior to the upgrade.
2. **Upgrade Execution:** Upgraded the StealthAUDIT server to version 12.0.
3. **Schema Migration:** Initiated schema migration, which was still in progress at the time of the last update.
4. **Issue Identification:** Identified that the FSAA job was failing during bulk import due to stale data in the T2 database.
5. **Data Clearing:** Cleared stale data from the T2 database and performed a fresh scan.

## Root Cause
The bulk import job was failing due to the T2 database holding stale information about hosts that were no longer available, which caused the import process to reject incomplete scan data.

## Solution
- Cleared the stale data from the T2 database.
- Rescanned the environment, which allowed the bulk import to succeed on the new scan.
- Confirmed that the Access Information Center (AIC) and Active Directory Integration (ADI) scanning were functioning correctly post-upgrade.

## Notes
- Ensure that any stale data is cleared from the T2 database before performing bulk imports to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to conduct a health check of the installation prior to upgrades to identify potential issues early on.
- The case can be reopened if any related issues arise in the future.
