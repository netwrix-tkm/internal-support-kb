- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance for upgrading the StealthAudit application to version 11.6 on their production servers (SMP & AIC) to ensure all environments are aligned to the same application version.

## Environment Details
- **Current Version:** 11.5
- **Target Version:** 11.6
- **Servers Involved:** Production Servers (SMP & AIC)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial meeting setup to discuss timeframes and availability for the upgrade.
2. Monitoring of the client's progress, including disk space increase.
3. Upgraded two servers to version 11.6.
4. Noted that attributes were lost during the upgrade process.
5. Suggested checking archived `.change` files for recovery of lost attributes.

## Root Cause
The loss of attributes during the upgrade process was identified as a potential issue, which may have been related to the upgrade procedure or the state of the servers prior to the upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully upgrading the NEA and AIC servers to version 11.6. The upgrade was completed after ensuring that the necessary disk space was available and addressing the attribute loss by checking archived `.change` files.

## Notes
- Ensure that sufficient disk space is available before performing upgrades to prevent stalling.
- Monitor for any attribute loss during upgrades and have a recovery plan in place, such as checking archived files.
- Future upgrades should include a review of the upgrade process to mitigate risks of data loss.
