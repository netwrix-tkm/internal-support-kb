## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ndp5ZIAR
- **Case Number:** 440845
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Excellus Health Plan, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Gary Bender
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer
- **Component:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0.0.1053

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) in a test environment to prepare for production deployment. The upgrade process encountered issues related to SQL Server permissions and schema creation.

## Environment Details
- **Current Versions Prior to Upgrade:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA): 11.6.0.90
  - Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC): 11.6.0.23
- **Target Versions After Upgrade:**
  - Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA): 12.0.0.1053
  - Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC): 12.0.0.48

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Gathered information on the current software versions installed using a PowerShell script.
2. Scheduled a meeting for the upgrade process with full admin access to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
3. Attempted to run the upgrade process, which included executing the `FS_MigrateSchema` job.
4. Verified SQL Server permissions and roles for the service account used during the upgrade.
5. Ran the schema creation job, which failed at task 120 of 132.
6. Investigated error logs and identified missing tables referenced in the error messages.
7. Conducted follow-up meetings to address SQL Server permission issues and schema migration.

## Root Cause
The upgrade process failed primarily due to insufficient SQL Server permissions for the service account, which prevented the creation of necessary database tables. Additionally, there were issues related to the data types in the original tables that conflicted with the new schema requirements.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Granting the service account the necessary SQL Server permissions, including `GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION`.
2. Running the `FS_MigrateSchema` job to migrate the schema correctly.
3. Ensuring that the latest version of the software was used during the upgrade process.

## Notes
- It is crucial to verify SQL Server permissions before attempting an upgrade to avoid similar issues.
- Future upgrades should consider checking for any changes in data types between versions to prevent schema creation errors.
- The customer should be informed about the importance of running the latest installer and any necessary pre-upgrade checks.
