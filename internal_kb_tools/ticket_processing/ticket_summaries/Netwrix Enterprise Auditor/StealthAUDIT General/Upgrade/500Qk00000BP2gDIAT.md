- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BP2gDIAT
- **Case Number:** 410869
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Mastercard
- **Contact Name:** Paige Wamsganz
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 10.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application for their production servers, specifically `stl2amcaud01` and `bel2amcaud01`.

## Environment Details
- Production servers: `stl2amcaud01`, `bel2amcaud01`
- Application version: 10.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to gather requirements and schedule the upgrade.
2. Discussed the need to wait for completion of other server upgrades (`stl4amcaud10` and `bel4amcaud10`) before proceeding.
3. Scheduled a meeting to review configurations and take necessary backups.
4. Monitored the job performance and addressed any issues that arose during the upgrade process.
5. Performed the upgrade of the NEA application on both servers.
6. Verified that the Unix jobs were successfully upgraded and that global settings were carried over.

## Root Cause
The need for the upgrade arose from the requirement to enhance the functionality and performance of the NEA application on the production servers, which was impacted by previous job performance issues.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully performed on both `stl2amcaud01` and `bel2amcaud01` servers. The Unix jobs were upgraded, and it was confirmed that all global settings were retained. The ticket was then put in a postponed status to allow for further validation of the jobs and settings.

## Notes
- The customer reported no issues following the upgrade, indicating a successful implementation.
- Future upgrades should ensure that all related jobs are monitored for performance to avoid delays.
- If similar issues arise, consider scheduling upgrades during maintenance windows to minimize impact on production environments.
