- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Regions Bank
- **Contact Name:** Jim Callison
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6.0.137 (upgraded from 11.6.0.43)

## Problem Description
The customer needed to patch the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and NEA Access Information Center (AIC) from outdated versions to the latest versions to ensure optimal performance and security.

## Environment Details
- **Current Versions Prior to Upgrade:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA): 11.6.0.43
  - NEA Access Information (AIC): 11.6.0.6
- **Service Accounts:** Both environments use Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) for NEA and AIC services.
- **SQL Server:** The SQL server for the environments is running on the same host as NEA.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a meeting to discuss the upgrade process.
2. Confirmed the need for a full backup and admin access to the NEA server and related SQL database.
3. Upgraded the applications from:
   - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.43 to 11.6.0.137
   - NEA Access Information Center (AIC) 11.6.0.6 to 11.6.0.37
4. Enabled debug logging in the NEA Console to capture detailed logs for any issues post-upgrade.
5. Monitored the job status and logs for any errors or performance issues.

## Root Cause
The initial problem stemmed from the use of outdated versions of the Netwrix applications, which were not performing optimally and required an upgrade to resolve performance issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and NEA Access Information Center to their latest versions. Post-upgrade, the applications were monitored, and it was confirmed that they were functioning correctly.

## Notes
- After the upgrade, there were reports of the scan not performing correctly, with jobs getting queued for an extended period. This necessitated further investigation and potentially a new ticket (00442987) to address the ongoing issues.
- It is recommended to always ensure that the latest versions of the software are in use to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If issues arise post-upgrade, enabling debug logging can provide insights into any underlying problems.
