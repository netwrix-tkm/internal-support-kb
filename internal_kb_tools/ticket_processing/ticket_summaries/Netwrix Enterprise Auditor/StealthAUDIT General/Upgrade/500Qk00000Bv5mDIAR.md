The customer requested guidance on the steps required to upgrade the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, including the Sensitive Data Addon and AIC.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5.
- The upgrade involves multiple components, including the Sensitive Data Addon.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with links to the relevant upgrade documentation:
   - [Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Upgrade Wizard](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm)

3. Addressed concerns regarding customizations and sensitive data criteria that may be affected during the upgrade process.
4. Followed up with the customer to check on the progress of the upgrade and offered further assistance.

## Root Cause
The customer needed clear instructions and reassurance regarding the upgrade process, particularly concerning the handling of customizations and sensitive data criteria.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with detailed upgrade instructions and links to the relevant documentation. Additionally, the customer was reassured about the archiving of customizations during the upgrade process and the need to reconfigure sensitive data criteria post-upgrade.

## Notes
- **Important Warnings:**
  - Customizations made by a Netwrix Engineer are archived during the upgrade process, but the customer should ensure that they have noted any specific configurations that need to be reapplied.
  - The new global settings will overwrite any previously configured Sensitive Data criteria, which must be reconfigured after the upgrade.
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Ensure that customers are aware of the potential impact on custom settings and provide them with a checklist for configurations that need to be noted before proceeding with the upgrade.
