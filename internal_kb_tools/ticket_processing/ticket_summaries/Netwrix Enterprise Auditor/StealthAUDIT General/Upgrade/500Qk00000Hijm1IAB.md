## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hijm1IAB
- **Case Number:** 425676
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh
- **Contact Name:** Mike Gaetano
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested an upgrade of their StealthAUDIT software from version 11.5 to the latest version (11.6) in both their development and production environments. They aimed to validate the upgrade in the development environment before proceeding with the production upgrade.

## Environment Details
- Development Environment: Upgraded to version 11.6
- Production Environment: Upgraded to version 11.6
- Notable issue: Excessive FSAA logs (over 103GB) despite retention settings configured for 7 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a pre-flight meeting to gather necessary configurations and screenshots for both environments.
2. Scheduled and executed the upgrade for the development environment on November 18, 2024.
3. Verified the functionality of the Access Information Center (AIC) and Published Reports after the upgrade.
4. Scheduled and executed the upgrade for the production environment on November 22, 2024.
5. Noted that the FSAA logs were excessively large and retained longer than configured.

## Root Cause
The excessive FSAA logs were caused by a bug in the previous version of the software that did not automatically clean up old logs. The new version (11.6) addressed this issue but did not retroactively clear existing logs.

## Solution
- Successfully upgraded both the development and production environments to version 11.6.
- Verified that AIC and Published Reports were functioning correctly post-upgrade.
- Informed the customer about the excessive log retention issue and suggested further investigation in a new support ticket.

## Notes
- The customer should ensure that the FileSystem Reports are set to publish correctly to the reporting site.
- It is recommended to check the settings for log retention and configure a job to clean up old logs to prevent excessive disk usage in the future.
- A new ticket was opened to address the FileSystem reporting and log retention issues.
