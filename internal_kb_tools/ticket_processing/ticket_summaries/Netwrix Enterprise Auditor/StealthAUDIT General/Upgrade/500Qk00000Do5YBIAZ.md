- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Do5YBIAZ
- **Case Number:** 416653
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Penn State University (Applied Research Lab)
- **Contact Name:** Troy Herrington
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.5.0.x (upgraded to 11.6)

## Problem Description
The customer requested support for upgrading their Stealthbits applications to the latest version. They were looking to schedule a time for the upgrade process.

## Environment Details
- **Current Versions:**
  - StealthAUDIT Access Information Center: 11.5.0.119
  - StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.5: 11.5.0.65
  - StealthAUDIT V11.5: 11.5.0.200
  - Stealthbits Activity Monitor: 6.0.1034

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Assigned the case to the Enterprise Auditor queue for specialized support.
2. Performed a preflight process for StealthAUDIT to prepare for the upgrade, including:
   - Taking screenshots of global settings.
   - Backing up job configuration data.
3. Discussed updating the SSL certificate through IIS and the new process for doing so.
4. Reviewed the need to update password credentials for the service account used by StealthAUDIT applications.
5. Identified storage capacity issues on the SQL server that could hinder the upgrade.
6. Recommended adding more space to the SQL server before proceeding with the upgrade.
7. Resolved the LogOn User error by signing in as the service account and performing the installation.
8. Updated SSL certificate bindings for the Access Information Center and the Published Reports console.
9. Verified access to the AIC and Published Reports web console post-upgrade.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to insufficient storage space on the SQL server, which prevented the Tier 1 database from being updated during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The upgrade of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application and all associated web applications was successfully performed to version 11.6. The upgrade process followed the documented procedures, including:
- Performing a full backup of the database.
- Taking snapshots of the application server.
- Ensuring no scheduled tasks were running during the upgrade.

## Notes
- Ensure that adequate storage space is available on the SQL server before initiating upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Always back up configurations and data before performing upgrades.
- Review and update SSL certificates as part of the upgrade process to maintain secure connections.
