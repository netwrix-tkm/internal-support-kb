## Problem Description
The customer inquired about performing in-place application upgrades for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and had specific questions regarding the upgrade process and database recovery methods.

## Environment Details
- Current OS: Windows Server 2019
- Planned OS: Windows Server 2022 (not being upgraded at this time)
- Database Recovery Method: Currently using Simple Recovery Method

## Troubleshooting Steps

## Root Cause
The customer was uncertain about the upgrade process and best practices for database recovery methods, leading to confusion about whether to upgrade the OS before the applications and how to configure the database recovery settings.

## Solution
1. **OS Upgrade Recommendation:** It is not recommended to perform an in-place upgrade of the operating system for the Netwrix Application server due to potential issues. Instead, it is advised to set up a new server with the desired OS and migrate Netwrix to that server.
   
2. **Application Upgrade Sequence:** The recommended approach is to migrate Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to the new server first. After confirming that everything is functioning correctly, the application can then be upgraded to the latest version.

3. **Database Recovery Method:** The customer should maintain all Netwrix databases in Simple Recovery Mode, as this is considered best practice.

## Notes
- The customer decided not to upgrade the OS at this time and will focus on upgrading the Netwrix products instead.
- It is important to open new support tickets for the upgrades of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Threat Protection to ensure proper assistance and tracking.
- Documentation for database migration is available, but it is recommended to contact support for assistance with the migration process, especially for large databases.
