- **Case Number:** 428596
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** State of South Dakota
- **Contact Name:** David Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6.0.122

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on the upgrade process from version 11.6.0.74 to the latest version 11.6.0.122 of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- Current version: NEA 10.6.0.74
- Other components:
  - NAM 7.1.179
  - SDD 11.6.0.12
  - AIC 11.6.0.21
- No on-premises SharePoint (SP) or File System (FS) proxies.
- NTP and NTM are on different servers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the client to clarify the upgrade process and components involved.
2. Conducted a pre-flight meeting to gather necessary information and plan the upgrade.
3. Scheduled and executed the upgrade meeting.
4. Upgraded NEA to version 11.6.0.122 without issues.
5. Identified two groups missing from the schedule due to discrepancies in the SharePoint group structure.
6. Recreated the missing groups, which allowed the schedule to recognize them again.

## Root Cause
The missing groups in the schedule were due to a discrepancy in the SharePoint group structure, where the client had split existing groups into sub-groups. This change did not trigger a conflict flag during the upgrade process.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully completed without any significant issues. The missing groups were recreated, resolving the scheduling discrepancies. The client was informed and confirmed that post-upgrade scans were completed without issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to group structures in SharePoint are communicated prior to upgrades to avoid similar issues.
- Always verify the group configurations post-upgrade to ensure all components are functioning as expected.
