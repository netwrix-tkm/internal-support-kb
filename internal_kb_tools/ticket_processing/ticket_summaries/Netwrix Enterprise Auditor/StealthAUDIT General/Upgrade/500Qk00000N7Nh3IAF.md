- **Case Number:** 439407
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Stamford Health
- **Contact Name:** Wajid Fazal
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.5.1355.1197

## Problem Description
The customer requested an upgrade of StealthAUDIT from version 11.5.1355.1197 to the latest version available.

## Environment Details
- Current version: 11.5.1355.1197
- Target version for upgrade: 11.6.0.139

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled initial meeting for the upgrade process.
2. Collected necessary information to prepare for the upgrade.
3. Advised the customer to create snapshots of the Auditor server, SQL database server, and Proxy server.
4. Provided a script for backing up the NEA server.
5. Discussed potential upgrade to version 12, but confirmed that an upgrade to version 11.6 was necessary first.
6. Conducted the upgrade to version 11.6.0.139 and tested the functionality post-upgrade.

## Root Cause
The need for the upgrade was driven by the end-of-life status of version 11.5, which was set to expire in October 2025. The proactive upgrade was initiated to ensure continued support and functionality.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully completed to version 11.6.0.139. The following components were upgraded:
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 11.6.0.139
- Sensitive Data Discovery to version 11.6.0.18
- Proxy server to version 11.6.0.37
- Access Information Center to version 11.6.0.37

Post-upgrade testing confirmed that Active Directory scans were completing successfully and that the file system schema creation tool ran without issues. The reporting consoles were reconfigured to use HTTPS, and access was validated.

## Notes
- Ensure to upgrade to version 11.6 before considering an upgrade to version 12.0.
- Monitor the end-of-life dates for software versions to avoid service interruptions.
- Always create backups and snapshots before performing upgrades to safeguard against data loss.
