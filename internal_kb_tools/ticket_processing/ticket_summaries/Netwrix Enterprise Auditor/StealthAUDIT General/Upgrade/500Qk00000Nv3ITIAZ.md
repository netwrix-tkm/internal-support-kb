- **Case Number:** 441641
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** AIQON SERVIÇOS EM INFORMATICA LTDA – Reseller
- **Contact Name:** Gustavo Rossato
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer
- **Component:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data Discovery
- **Version:** 12.0.0.1070

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with collecting sensitive data on their file server using Netwrix Access Analyzer. While general information such as activity and permissions could be collected successfully, attempts to collect sensitive data resulted in multiple errors.

## Environment Details
- The customer recently upgraded from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 to Netwrix Access Analyzer 12.0.
- The Sensitive Data Discovery module was not found in version 12.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run the "SEEK System Scans" job, receiving the error: 
   ```
   Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.AppletDeployment | No need to scan, Tier 2 DB USN is greater than Tier 1 DB USN, needs bulk import.
   ```
2. The customer unchecked the options "Restart Incomplete Scans after" and "Rescan unimported hosts after" in the "Scan Settings," but the error persisted.
3. The customer changed the hosts used for scanning, including using the local server and selecting all hosts, but the issue remained.
4. In the "SEEK Bulk Import" job, the customer encountered the error:
   ```
   Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAABulkImportProcess | Sequence contains no elements.
   ```
5. The customer provided error logs for review and requested assistance.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a defect related to the upgrade process of the Netwrix Access Analyzer. The Tier 2 database (T2 DB) was out of sync with the Tier 1 database (T1 DB), leading to the errors during sensitive data collection.

## Solution
The resolution involved the following steps:
1. The support technician uninstalled the problematic version (12.0.0.1053) of Netwrix Access Analyzer.
2. The technician then installed the updated version (12.0.0.1070).
3. After the installation, a repair of the affected hosts was performed, followed by a successful execution of both the 0-level scan and the Bulk Import scan.

## Notes
- It is recommended to ensure that the databases (T1 and T2) are synchronized after any upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Customers should verify the availability of the Sensitive Data Discovery module in their version before upgrading.
- Regular backups of the databases are advised to facilitate recovery in case of upgrade-related issues.
