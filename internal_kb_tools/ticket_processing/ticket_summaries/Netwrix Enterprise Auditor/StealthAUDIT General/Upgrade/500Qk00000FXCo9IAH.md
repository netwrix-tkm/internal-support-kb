## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FXCo9IAH
- **Case Number:** 420466
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Prince George's County, Maryland
- **Contact Name:** Nooshin Ourahizadeh
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, Prince George's County, Maryland, reported issues with their current installation of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) v11.5, specifically that they needed to reboot the application server each time they attempted to open NEA to successfully connect to SQL and launch the application. They were advised to upgrade to NEA v11.6.

## Environment Details
- Current version: NEA v11.5 (11.5.0.214)
- Application server: pgcoitdata21
- SQL Server database running on the same server
- Server specifications: 4 CPU cores, 24 GB RAM, limited disk space (7-8 GB free on C: drive)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed server specifications and resource usage.
2. Recommended increasing CPU cores from 4 to 8.
3. Suggested expanding memory from 24 GB to either 48 GB or 64 GB.
4. Advised adding 100-200 GB of disk space to the C: drive.
5. Identified lack of necessary credentials for SQL authentication account.
6. Created a new default storage profile for NEA using a service account for Windows authentication.
7. Assigned full dbo rights to the service account for the StealthAUDIT database.
8. Installed the AIC using the service account.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to insufficient server resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) which led to performance problems when launching the application. Additionally, the lack of proper SQL authentication credentials hindered the upgrade process.

## Solution
The resolution involved performing the upgrade from StealthAUDIT v11.5 to NEA v11.6 by following the documented upgrade instructions. A new storage profile was created using a service account to resolve access issues, and the service account was granted full dbo rights to the StealthAUDIT database. The AIC was also installed using this service account.

## Notes
- Ensure that server specifications meet the minimum requirements for running NEA, especially when handling multiple components like Azure and FileSystems.
- Always verify that necessary credentials for SQL authentication are available before attempting upgrades.
- Monitor server resource usage regularly to prevent similar issues in the future.
