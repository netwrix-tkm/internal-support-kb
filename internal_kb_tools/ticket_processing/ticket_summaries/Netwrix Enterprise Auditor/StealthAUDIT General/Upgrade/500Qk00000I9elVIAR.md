The customer requested assistance to schedule a meeting for backing up the current installation of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and upgrading it to the latest version available.

## Environment Details
- Current version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor prior to upgrade was not specified.
- The upgrade involved the NEA server and four file servers.

4. Collected necessary files and information required for the upgrade.
5. Executed the upgrade process on November 19, 2024, to version 11.6.0.117.
6. Verified the functionality of the NEA, AIC, and reporting module post-upgrade.

## Root Cause
The issue was not a malfunction but a proactive request for an upgrade to ensure the customer was using the latest version of the software, which included enhancements and security updates.

## Solution
The upgrade was completed successfully, which included:
- Upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 11.6.0.117.
- Upgrading the sensitive data module on the NEA server and four file servers to version 11.6.0.13.
- Upgrading the FSAA proxy on the four file servers to version 11.6.0.36.
- Post-upgrade verification confirmed that the reporting console, AIC, and NEA were all functioning correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that all pre-flight checks are completed before scheduling the actual upgrade to avoid conflicts in scheduling.
- It is advisable to confirm the correct dates for meetings to prevent scheduling errors.
- After an upgrade, always verify the functionality of all components to ensure a smooth transition to the new version.
