- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DNaL6IAL
- **Case Number:** 415621
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** BAE Systems, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Dominic Archer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues following an upgrade to version 11.6 of their system. Specifically, the StealthAudit user website and the AIC website were down, and the Active Directory (AD) inventory scan was failing.

## Environment Details
- **Upgrade Version:** 11.6
- **Affected Components:** AIC website, Published Reports, SharePoint module, ADI scan

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the status of the AIC and Published Reports.
2. Checked the configuration of the SharePoint module.
3. Investigated the ADI scan errors for potential network issues.
4. Restarted the Netwrix Web Server service for Published Reports.
5. Resecured the AIC to port 481.
6. Restored SharePoint configuration from an archive.
7. Monitored the ADI scan for network stability.

## Root Cause
The issues were primarily due to incorrect configurations following the upgrade, compounded by network and DNS issues that the customer was already aware of.

## Solution
- The AIC was resecured to port 481, resolving access issues.
- The Published Reports service was restored by restarting the Netwrix Web Server service after rebinding to port 443.
- The SharePoint module configuration was successfully restored from an archive.
- The ADI scan errors were attributed to a temporary network hiccup, which resolved itself, allowing the scan to run successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all services are correctly configured and secured after an upgrade.
- Monitor network stability during and after upgrades, as transient issues can affect service availability.
- Customers should be advised to check their DNS settings if they experience connectivity issues post-upgrade.
