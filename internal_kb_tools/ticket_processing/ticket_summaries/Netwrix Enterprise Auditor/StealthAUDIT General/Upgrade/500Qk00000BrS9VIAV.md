- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6.0.75

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with upgrading their production and failover environments from older versions of Stealth applications to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Versions:**
  - StealthAUDIT (SA): 11.5.0.214
  - SA Access Information (AIC): 11.5.0.125
  - Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM): 6.0.1111
- **New Versions:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA): 11.6.0.75
  - NEA Access Information Center (AIC): 11.6.0.14
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM): 7.0.3119
- **New Install Paths:**
  - D:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center
  - D:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Scheduled a prep meeting to discuss the upgrade process and requirements.
2. Verified the current versions of the applications in both production and failover environments.
3. Ran PowerShell scripts to update URL certificates.
4. Executed `netsh` commands to delete and add SSL certificates for the new versions.
5. Confirmed the correct loading of the NEA URL post-upgrade.
6. Provided guidance on updating SQL instance/DB settings if the production SQL instance was used.

## Root Cause
The need for the upgrade arose from the requirement to move from outdated versions of the Stealth applications to the latest Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version, which included enhancements and security updates.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully executed by following the outlined steps, including:
- Updating the URL certificates using PowerShell and `netsh` commands.
- Ensuring that the necessary permissions and configurations were in place for the new installations.
- Running SQL update scripts to ensure the database settings were correctly aligned with the new application versions.

## Notes
- Post-upgrade, if the production SQL instance/DB is being used, the following SQL update script must be run:
  ```sql
  Declare @OHost varchar (128)
  Declare @NHost varchar (128)
  Set @OHost = '<OldServer>' -- Name of the original SA Console being cloned
  Set @NHost = '<NewServer>' -- Name of the new SA Console
  Update [HostMaster_SANodeFilter]
  SET SA_Node = @NHost
  Where SA_Node = @OHost;
  Update [HostListsTbl]
  SET SA_Node = @NHost
  Where SA_Node = @OHost;
  Update [QueryTbl]
  SET SA_Node = @NHost
  Where SA_Node = @OHost;
  ```
- Ensure that all scripts and paths are updated accordingly to avoid any issues during future operations.
- The upgrade process was well-received by the customer, who expressed satisfaction with the support provided.
