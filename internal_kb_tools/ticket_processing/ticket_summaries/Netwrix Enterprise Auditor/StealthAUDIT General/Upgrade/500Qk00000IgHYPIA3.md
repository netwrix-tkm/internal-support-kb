- **Case Number:** 427937
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission
- **Contact Name:** Daniel Pujada
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with upgrading StealthAUDIT to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (version 11.6). The upgrade process encountered issues related to SSL certificate errors when accessing the AIC and PubReports.

## Environment Details
- Existing version: 11.5.1355.1197
- Upgrade involved only Active Directory (AD); no File System (FS) or Security Data Domain (SDD) was involved.
- Preflight meeting completed successfully prior to the upgrade.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a preflight meeting to gather necessary screenshots and backup configuration files.
2. Scheduled an upgrade meeting for December 4, 2024.
3. Attempted to access AIC and PubReports, which resulted in SSL certificate errors.
4. Investigated the SSL certificate issue, discovering that the old certificate was no longer on the server.
5. Checked the bindings for the SSL certificate and found they had not been updated to the new certificate.
6. Deleted the old SSL bindings and created new bindings for the updated certificate.

## Root Cause
The SSL certificate error occurred because the old certificate had been removed from the server, and the bindings for the new certificate had not been configured correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Deleting the old SSL bindings.
- Binding the new SSL certificate to the necessary services (AIC and PubReports).
- Confirming that AIC and PubReports were functioning correctly post-configuration.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSL certificates are updated and bindings are configured correctly during upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- The customer reported an additional issue with the Weak Password report, which was resolved by setting the job to use the default profile after the non-default profile was removed. A new ticket was created for this issue.
