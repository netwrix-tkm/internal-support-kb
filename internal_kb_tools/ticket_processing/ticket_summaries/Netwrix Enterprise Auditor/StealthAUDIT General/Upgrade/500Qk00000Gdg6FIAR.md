## Problem Description
The customer required assistance in migrating their NEA (Netwrix Enterprise Auditor) database to a new SQL Server 2022 instance.

## Environment Details

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to migrate the NEA database to a new SQL Server instance, which required reconfiguration of the application settings to ensure connectivity to the new database.

## Solution
The migration was successfully completed by following these steps:
- Disabling scheduled jobs and backing up the database.
- Restoring the database to the new SQL Server instance.
- Updating application settings in NEA to point to the new server.
- Uninstalling and reinstalling the AIC application to ensure it was configured correctly for the new database.

## Notes
- Ensure that all scheduled jobs are disabled before performing a database migration to prevent conflicts.
- Always prefer Windows Authentication for database connections when possible for enhanced security.
- After migration, verify all application settings and configurations to ensure proper functionality.
- Document the migration process for future reference to streamline similar upgrades.
