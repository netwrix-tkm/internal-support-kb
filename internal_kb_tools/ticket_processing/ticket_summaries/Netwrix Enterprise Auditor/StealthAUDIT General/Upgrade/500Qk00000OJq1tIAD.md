## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OJq1tIAD
- **Case Number:** 442753
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** US Department of Treasury-Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
- **Contact Name:** Eugene Johnson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer was upgrading from version 11.6 to version 12.0 of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor in their production environment. During the upgrade process, the FSAA create schema job was running for an extended period, specifically over 45 minutes, causing concern about the upgrade's progress.

## Environment Details
- The upgrade involved using Active Directory (AD) and FSAA/FSAC.
- The NAA server did not have internet access, which was noted as a potential issue for accessing Azure URLs.
- The environment included many custom jobs and reports, with one FSAA proxy configured.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Completed the pre-flight process for the upgrade without issues.
2. Scheduled the upgrade meeting for April 30th.
3. During the upgrade, confirmed that the FSAA create schema job was active using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
4. Allowed the FSAA create schema job to continue running overnight to monitor its progress.

## Root Cause
The prolonged execution time of the FSAA create schema job was identified as a separate issue that required further investigation. It was not directly related to the upgrade process itself, as the upgrade installation proceeded without any errors.

## Solution
The upgrade to version 12.0 was completed successfully. The issue with the FSAA create schema job was documented and split into its own ticket (00443816), which was subsequently resolved. Post-upgrade UI performance issues were noted to require a separate ticket for further investigation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the NAA server has access to necessary Azure URLs if EntraID auditing is to be set up in the future.
- Monitor long-running jobs during upgrades and consider splitting them into separate tickets for resolution to avoid confusion.
- Future upgrades should include a review of custom jobs and reports to ensure compatibility with new versions.
