- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with updating their StealthAUDIT from version 11.5.1346.1069 to the latest stable version, 11.6.x.x. They inquired about having a resource available during the update process in case any issues arose.

## Environment Details
- Current version installed: 11.5.1346.1069
- Target version for upgrade: 11.6.x.x

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a call with the customer to perform the upgrade.
2. Successfully upgraded to:
   - NEA 11.6.0.114
   - AIC 11.6.0.24
3. Identified issues in the environment:
   - SVC Account can run any job but cannot save schedules or schedule jobs.
   - Local System Account cannot run any job but can schedule jobs.

## Root Cause
The issues encountered were related to permissions and account configurations within the environment. Specifically, the SVC Account had limitations on saving schedules, while the Local System Account had restrictions on executing jobs.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully completed, resolving the version update request. However, to address the identified issues:
- Recommended reviewing and adjusting the permissions for the SVC Account to allow saving schedules and scheduling jobs.
- Suggested verifying the configuration of the Local System Account to enable it to run jobs as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure that account permissions are properly configured before performing upgrades to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to have a rollback plan in place when performing upgrades, especially in environments with complex permission settings.
