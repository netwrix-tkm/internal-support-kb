- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Freedom Mortgage
- **Contact Name:** David Grom
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, David Grom from Freedom Mortgage, reported issues following a scheduled upgrade of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Post-upgrade, several FSAA scan jobs were still showing as "running" with a duration of "0 seconds," indicating that the jobs did not complete properly.

## Environment Details
- Upgraded to:
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6.0.113
  - Netwrix Access Information Center v11.6.0.25
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor (and its agents) v7.1.179
- The upgrade was performed over the weekend during a change control window.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the upgrade was completed successfully.
2. Reviewed the FSAA job statuses and noted that several servers were still marked as "running" with no duration.
3. Checked the Job groups folder and found a "running.lck" file still present.
4. Deleted the "running.lck" file to clear the lock on the jobs.
5. Restarted the FSAA scan jobs to see if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a "running.lck" file remaining in the Job groups folder, which indicated that a previous scan did not terminate properly. This could have been due to overlapping jobs or a failure in the job execution process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the "running.lck" file, which allowed the FSAA scan jobs to restart successfully. A new scan was initiated, and the customer was advised to monitor the results.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that no overlapping jobs are scheduled, as this can lead to similar issues in the future.
- If servers are decommissioned, they can be safely removed from the FSAA folder, but consider whether to also drop their data from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's database.
- Future upgrades should include a review of job statuses and lock files to prevent similar occurrences.
