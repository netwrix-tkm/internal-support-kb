## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Do5t6IAB
- **Case Number:** 416657
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Express
- **Contact Name:** Alex Parsa
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
After upgrading to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the customer reported that scans were not functioning. The error message indicated an inability to initialize the scan session with any proxy host supplied.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 11.5
- **Upgrade Version:** 11.6.0.83
- **Error Message:** 
  ```
  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configuration settings for the data collectors.
2. Checked the proxy host environmental variables to ensure they pointed to the correct historical location of the T2 databases and log files.
3. Attempted to run scans after confirming the proxy settings.
4. Identified that the NC group was using the wrong server and updated it accordingly.
5. Renamed the T2 database folder for the NC.
6. Assigned the proxy to the query for the NC.
7. Adjusted permissions and settings related to the FSAA applet.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the security requirements introduced in version 11.6, which mandated TLS 1.2 communication with the SQL backend. This change led to compatibility issues with the existing proxy configurations and database connections.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Rolled back the upgrade from version 11.6.0.83 to version 11.5.
2. Uninstalled the 11.6 proxies and re-installed the 11.5 version.
3. Corrected the proxy host environmental variables to ensure they pointed to the correct historical locations of the T2 databases and log files.
4. Ensured that the necessary permissions were granted to the service account for scanning.

## Notes
- Future upgrades should be carefully evaluated for compatibility with existing configurations, especially regarding security protocols like TLS.
- It is advisable to verify proxy settings and permissions before and after an upgrade to prevent similar issues.
- Documentation on manual certificate configuration for FSAA should be reviewed to ensure compliance with new security requirements.
