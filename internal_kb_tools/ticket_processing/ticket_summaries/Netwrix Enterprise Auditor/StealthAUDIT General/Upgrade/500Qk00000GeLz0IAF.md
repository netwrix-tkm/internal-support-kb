## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GeLz0IAF
- **Case Number:** 423000
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Doctors Company
- **Contact Name:** Chad Fontanini
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6.115

## Problem Description
The customer requested an upgrade for StealthAudit and Stealthbits Activity Monitor. During the upgrade process, issues arose specifically with the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM), which failed to connect to the Nasuni sources, resulting in multiple error messages.

## Environment Details
- Upgraded components included:
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)
  - Access Information Center (AIC)
  - FSProxy service
- The upgrade was performed on a file server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to upgrade NEA, AIC, and FSProxy service successfully.
2. Encountered errors with NAM, specifically:
   ```
   Error SYSLOG: UDP://NPNETWRIXSD101:10000 - npnfiler102: QuerySysInfo failed. An item with the same key has already been added.
   ```
3. Tried generating new API keys for the Nasuni sources, but the same error persisted.
4. Rolled back the client to revert NAM changes.
5. Re-upgraded NAM after running the new FS create schema job.
6. Re-upgraded AIC and FSProxy service.
7. Confirmed that NAM was functioning correctly after the rollback and re-upgrade.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict during the upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor, which resulted in the inability to connect to the Nasuni sources. The error messages indicated that duplicate keys were being added during the configuration process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Rolling back the changes made during the NAM upgrade.
- Re-upgrading NAM to ensure compatibility with the existing configuration.
- Confirming that all components (NEA, AIC, FSProxy) were functioning correctly post-upgrade.

## Notes
- The issue with the Netwrix Activity Monitor was escalated to a separate ticket (00423204) for further investigation by the development team.
- The customer did not respond to multiple follow-up emails regarding the closure of this ticket, leading to its closure without confirmation.
- Future upgrades should ensure that all components are compatible and that any potential conflicts are addressed prior to the upgrade process.
