- **Case Number:** 443564
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Kathy Eads (License Primary User)
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NAA Console
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0.0.1070

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while upgrading from version 11.6.0.133 to NAA 12.0. They experienced crashes in the NEA console due to a .NET error (clp.dll) when attempting to load the query configuration pop-up. After the upgrade, the FSAA Create Schema job failed to create new tables and migrate data, and the NAA console was running very slowly.

## Environment Details
- Current Version: 11.6.0.133
- Upgrade Target: NAA 12.0.0.1070
- Required .NET Version: .NET 8 (to be installed before the upgrade)
- FSAA scans in local mode
- No proxies or SDD in use

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Rebooted the server, which temporarily resolved the NEA console crashing issue.
2. Gathered logs related to the Create Schema job failure.
3. Ran the FS_MigrateSchema instant job to address the Create Schema job failure.
4. Monitored the performance of the NAA console post-upgrade.

## Root Cause
The initial crashing of the NEA console was attributed to a missing or incompatible .NET version (the system was running .NET Framework 4.8). The Create Schema job failure was likely due to issues with data migration and table creation processes that were not properly handled during the upgrade.

## Solution
- The upgrade from version 11.6.0.133 to 12.0.0.1070 was successfully completed.
- The FS_MigrateSchema job was executed, which resolved the Create Schema job failure, allowing it to complete successfully.
- The client was advised to monitor the NAA console performance, which remained sluggish and would require a separate ticket if issues persisted.

## Notes
- Ensure that .NET 8 is installed prior to upgrading to NAA 12.0 to prevent similar issues.
- The sluggish performance of the NAA console post-upgrade has been noted in other cases and may require further investigation or a separate support ticket.
- Regular monitoring of the console's performance after upgrades is recommended to identify potential issues early.
