## Problem Description
Daimler Trucks North America LLC reported the need to run two versions of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) in parallel: version 11.5 in production and version 11.6 in development. The goal was to facilitate an upgrade while maintaining operational continuity.

## Environment Details
- Current Production Version: NEA 11.5
- New Development Version: NEA 11.6 installed on a new development machine with an upgraded proxy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a Zoom meeting with John Anunsen and Andy to discuss the upgrade process.
2. Confirmed the installation of NEA 11.6 on a new development machine.
3. Reviewed the upgrade plan for transitioning from NEA 11.5 to NEA 11.6 in the production environment.
4. Ensured that the upgraded proxy for production was also planned as part of the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the need to run two different versions of the software simultaneously, which required careful planning and execution to avoid conflicts and ensure compatibility.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Installing NEA 11.6 on a new development machine.
- Planning the upgrade of the production environment from NEA 11.5 to NEA 11.6, including the upgrade of the proxy.
- Finalizing the upgrade strategy during the Zoom meeting, which confirmed the steps to be taken for a smooth transition.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that both versions are compatible and that the upgrade process is well-documented to avoid any potential issues during the transition.
- Future upgrades should consider the implications of running multiple versions in parallel and plan accordingly to minimize downtime and operational impact.
