## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GUnV8IAL
- **Case Number:** 422576
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Motors, LLC
- **Contact Name:** William Dammeier
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** AIC Upgrade
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested an upgrade of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) from version 11.5 to 11.6. While the NEA upgrade was successful, the upgrade of the AIC (Auditor Integration Component) failed to bind to the port, and no logs were generated to indicate any issues.

## Environment Details
- NEA was upgraded to version 11.6.0.115.
- The AIC service starts but does not bind to the designated port.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the successful upgrade of NEA to version 11.6.0.115.
2. Attempted to start the AIC service, which started without binding to the port.
3. Checked for logs related to the AIC service, but none were found.
4. Conducted a preflight check and confirmed all necessary files and images were uploaded.
5. Noted that the database was initially inaccessible due to missing credentials, which were to be provided by the customer.
6. Escalated the issue for further investigation after identifying missing files that prevented configuration edits on ADI scans.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the AIC upgrade issue was identified as missing files that were necessary for the configuration of the AIC service. Additionally, the database credentials were not available at the time of the upgrade, which contributed to the inability to complete the AIC upgrade.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Providing the customer with the necessary hotfix (version 11.6.0.053a) that addressed the missing files and configuration issues.
- Ensuring that the customer obtained the correct database credentials, allowing for successful binding of the AIC service to the port.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary files are present before performing upgrades, especially for components like AIC.
- Always verify database credentials are accessible prior to upgrades to avoid service binding issues.
- Monitor logs closely during upgrades to catch any issues early in the process.
