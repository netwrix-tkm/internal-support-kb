## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OB5GHIA1
- **Case Number:** 442486
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Acacia Communications, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Nicholas Smits
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the '0-Create Schema' job was stuck on 'SQL Script Executing: 1 of 3' after upgrading to version 12.0. The job would run for about a day before timing out, which prevented the customer from completing the SQL migration necessary to use the new version correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 1053

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run the Create Schema job after upgrading to version 12.0.
2. Debug logging was enabled to capture detailed logs during the execution of the job.
3. Foreign key constraints were removed from the tables `SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails` and `SA_FSAA_ResourceMap` to potentially speed up the execution.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ```
4. The job was monitored for performance and any further timeouts.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by foreign key constraints that were slowing down the execution of the SQL scripts during the schema creation process. These constraints were preventing the job from completing in a timely manner, leading to timeouts.

## Solution
The resolution involved removing the foreign key constraints from the affected tables, which allowed the Create Schema job to execute successfully without timing out. After implementing these changes, the customer confirmed that the schema update completed successfully.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the execution of the Create Schema job closely after making changes to constraints or other database settings.
- If similar issues arise in the future, consider enabling debug logging and removing constraints as initial troubleshooting steps.
- Always ensure that any changes made to the database schema are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders to avoid potential data integrity issues.
