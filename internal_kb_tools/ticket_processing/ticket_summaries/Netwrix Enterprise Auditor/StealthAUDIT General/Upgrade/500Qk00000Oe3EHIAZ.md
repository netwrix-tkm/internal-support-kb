## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Oe3EHIAZ
- **Case Number:** 443716
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WellSpan Health
- **Contact Name:** John Masgalas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA Console
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 12.0.1070

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues following an upgrade from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.6 to version 12.0. Specifically, scheduled tasks were not appearing, and errors were encountered when attempting to access the Schedules page.

## Environment Details
- Upgraded from NEA version 11.6.0.130 to 12.0.1070
- Upgraded 7 FSAA Proxy Servers from version 11.6.0.37 to 12.0.0.1048
- Upgraded Access Information Center from version 11.6.0.32 to 12.0.0.48

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reregistered the scheduled tasks.
2. Deleted all existing tasks and attempted to create new ones, which resulted in the same error.
3. Checked for duplicate entries in `C:\Windows\Tasks`, finding only the `SA.dat` file.
4. Confirmed that the installation was performed with an admin account and that all installers were unblocked.
5. Verified that local admins had full control permissions on the `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks` folder.
6. Engaged development team for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by a Jobs archive being unzipped in the Jobs directory, which led to enumeration issues and errors when accessing scheduled tasks.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Removing the unzipped Jobs archive from the Jobs directory.
- Re-importing the scheduled tasks into the Windows Task Scheduler without issues.
- Running the `0-CreateSchema` command.
- Setting the Published Reports web service to use the NEA Service Account.

Post-fix, it was confirmed that the previously observed issues with scheduled tasks not kicking off (specifically bulk imports post-scans) had resolved, pending verification from additional scans.

## Notes
- Ensure that no archived jobs are unzipped in the Jobs directory during upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Always verify permissions and task registrations after an upgrade to ensure proper functionality.
- Maintain backups of the server prior to upgrades for rollback purposes if necessary.
