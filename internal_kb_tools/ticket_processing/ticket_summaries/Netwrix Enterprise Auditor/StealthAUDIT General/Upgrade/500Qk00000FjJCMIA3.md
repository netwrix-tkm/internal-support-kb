- **Case Number:** 420979
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Daimler Trucks North America LLC
- **Contact Name:** John Anunsen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Upgrade
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested an upgrade of their production suite from version 11.5 to 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).

## Environment Details
- The upgrade involved multiple components, including NEA and NAM (Netwrix Auditor Manager).
- The customer was using an older version of SAM (3.0) on a different server for auditing purposes, which was not updated due to .NET compatibility issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a preflight meeting to gather pre-upgrade configurations and logs.
2. Held an upgrade meeting to perform the NEA upgrade.
3. Planned a subsequent meeting for upgrading NAM, which would be tracked under a separate ticket.
4. Noted that the old SAM version was still in use but the client was no longer interested in auditing those servers.
5. Gathered screenshots and documentation of the current setup for reference.
6. Confirmed the installation path for the new version of SAM and executed the upgrade.
7. Monitored the upgrade process and addressed any errors related to server communication and policy creation.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was the need to upgrade the NEA from version 11.5 to 11.6, which required careful planning and execution to ensure compatibility and functionality across the customer's environment.

## Solution
The upgrade was successfully completed through the following steps:
- The NEA was upgraded to version 11.6 during the scheduled upgrade meeting.
- The NAM upgrade was planned for a future meeting, ensuring that the upgrade process was organized and documented.
- The old SAM version was uninstalled from servers that were no longer being audited, streamlining the environment.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all pre-upgrade configurations and logs are gathered before proceeding with upgrades to avoid potential issues.
- Future upgrades should consider the compatibility of all components involved, especially when dealing with legacy systems.
- Communication with the client is crucial, especially regarding any network issues that may arise during remote sessions.
