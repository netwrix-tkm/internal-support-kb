- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Jcf0EIAR
- **Case Number:** 430150
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Doctors Company
- **Contact Name:** Chad Fontanini
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Custom Reports
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while trying to create a custom report in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, stating that the report was not functioning as expected.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.115

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified that the custom report was targeting the `FSAC_ActivityEventsView` table, which was causing performance issues.
2. Compared the performance of the `FSAC_ActivityEventsView` table with the `FSAA_ResourceView` table.
3. Queried the `SA_FSAA_ResourceView` table using the following SQL script:
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP (1000) [HostID], [HostName], [ID], [ParentResourceID], [Name], 
   [Path], [ResourceType], [ResourceTypeDescription], [OwnerID], 
   [RightsProxyID], [GatesProxyID], [NestedLevel], [Size], 
   [LastModified], [LastAccessed], [Created], [USN], 
   [DeletedUSN], [PermissionChange], [InheritedPermission], 
   [DirectPermission]
   FROM [Netwrix Enterprise Auditor].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesView]
   WHERE ResourceID =
   ```
4. Located the desired `ResourceID` by targeting the path using the following WHERE clause:
   ```sql
   WHERE hostID = (HostID Number) AND Path LIKE (File Path)
   ```
5. Updated the old analysis task SQL script to include the new `ResourceID` and modified the time parameters from `@lastweek` to `@lastmonth` within a 30-day time frame.
6. Deleted an old report that was experiencing issues with exporting as a CSV.
7. Created a new report using the modified SQL script, which successfully generated the required data.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the custom report targeting the `FSAC_ActivityEventsView` table, which had significantly slower query performance compared to the `FSAA_ResourceView` table.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Querying the `SA_FSAA_ResourceView` table instead of the `FSAC_ActivityEventsView` table.
- Updating the SQL script to include the correct `ResourceID` and adjusting the time parameters to ensure the report generated the correct information.
- Creating a new report with the updated SQL script, which successfully generated the desired output.

## Notes
- When creating custom reports, always consider the performance implications of the tables being queried.
- If performance issues arise, evaluate alternative tables that may provide the same data with better efficiency.
- Ensure to test the report generation after making changes to the SQL script to confirm that it functions as expected.
