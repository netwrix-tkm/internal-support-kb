## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LDYr3IAH
- **Case Number:** 434003
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Fenwick & West LLP
- **Contact Name:** Kevin Moore
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on how to define the Stale parameter for the File System module to extend the stale content reporting period beyond one year, specifically to 8, 9, or 10 years. They also inquired about configuring a report to pull data based on a modified stale date parameter.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customer's requirements regarding the Stale parameter for the File System module.
2. Investigated the existing SQL script used for the SA_ENG_FSAA_FolderAging report.
3. Modified the SQL script to accommodate the customer's request for a longer stale content reporting period.

## Root Cause
The default configuration of the Stale parameter in the File System module was limited to one year, which did not meet the customer's needs for extended reporting periods.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the SQL script associated with the SA_ENG_FSAA_FolderAging report. This modification allowed the customer to pull stale content data for periods of 8, 9, or 10 years as requested.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future modifications to SQL scripts are documented and tested to prevent potential issues with report accuracy.
- Customers should be informed about the limitations of the default settings and the possibility of custom SQL modifications for specific reporting needs.
