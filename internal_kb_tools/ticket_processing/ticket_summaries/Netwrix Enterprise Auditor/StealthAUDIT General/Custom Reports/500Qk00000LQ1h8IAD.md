## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LQ1h8IAD
- **Case Number:** 434486
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** State of South Dakota
- **Contact Name:** Evan Wempe
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a certain subset of custom reports was disappearing from the NEA web portal after a short, unspecified duration. Regenerating the reports temporarily restored their visibility in the portal.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the behavior of the NEA web portal regarding custom reports.
2. Investigated the process of how the reports were copied to identify any potential issues.
3. Attempted to regenerate the reports to confirm that they would reappear in the web portal.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a conflict arising from the method used to copy the reports, which potentially affected the report GUID (Globally Unique Identifier).

## Solution
To resolve the issue, a standard copy/paste action was performed to ensure that the report GUIDs were correctly maintained, thereby preventing the disappearance of the custom reports from the web portal.

## Notes
- Ensure that reports are copied using the standard method to avoid GUID conflicts in the future.
- Monitor the behavior of custom reports after regeneration to confirm that they remain visible in the portal.
