- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Gjv0xIAB
- **Case Number:** 423158
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Express
- **Contact Name:** Alex Parsa
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance with running a large-scale effective access report on the Access Information Center (AIC) that involved over 9,000 groups. They needed clarification on whether they could run the report themselves or if an engineer was required to assist.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 196
- **Data Scope:** Over 9,000 groups

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Clarified the customer's ability to run the report independently.
2. Requested a list of group names to be included in the report.
3. Investigated the limitations of the AIC in generating large-scale reports.
4. Explored SQL views (`SA_FSAA_DirectPermissionsView` and `SA_FSAA_PermissionsView`) to gather necessary data.
5. Tested a TSQL query to filter and retrieve relevant group information.
6. Modified existing reports to include additional data from the `SA_FSAA_PermissionsView` table.

## Root Cause
The AIC was not designed to efficiently produce large-scale reports for extensive data sets. Its design was more suited for reviewing specific groups and their access rather than generating comprehensive reports for thousands of groups.

## Solution
A report template was created that utilized the following SQL views to gather the necessary data:
- `SA_FSAA_DirectPermissionsView`
- `SA_FSAA_PermissionsView`

Additionally, a TSQL query was provided to filter group data effectively:
```sql
SELECT [DomainCanonicalName], [PrincipalId], [SamAccountName], [NTAccount], [DisplayName], [IsDeleted], [DistinguishedName], [GroupScope], [GroupTarget], [DirectMemberCount]
FROM [StealthAUDIT].[dbo].[SA_ADInventory_GroupsView]
WHERE [SamAccountName] LIKE 'domain%'
```
The report was modified to include both the `SA_FSAA_DirectPermissionsView` and `SA_FSAA_PermissionsView` to ensure all relevant data was captured.

## Notes
- It is recommended that the object owners perform access reviews within the AIC to ensure proper permissions management.
- If report generation takes longer than 15 minutes, consider reviewing the `AuthSessionTimeout` value to prevent session timeouts.
- Future users should be aware that generating reports for large data sets may require additional configuration or support.
