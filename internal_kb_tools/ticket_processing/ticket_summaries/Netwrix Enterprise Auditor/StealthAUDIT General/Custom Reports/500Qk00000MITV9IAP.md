- **Case Number:** 436978
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WellSpan Health
- **Contact Name:** John Masgalas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported difficulty in generating a report that included files containing passwords. They observed that while a server with a file containing a password was visible in the AIC, it did not appear in the generated report. The customer suspected they were missing something in the report configuration.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team reviewed the report configuration and identified that the desired data could be obtained from two specific views: `OpenShares_SDDDetails` and `FS_SharesRanked_SDD`.
2. The current report was modified to include both views, allowing for the display of two rows of data in a single report.
3. The customer was instructed to generate the report with the updated modifications and provide the results for further review.

## Root Cause
No specific root cause was identified for the initial issue; it was determined that the report configuration needed adjustment to include the correct data sources.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Identifying and modifying the report to include the `OpenShares_SDDDetails` and `FS_SharesRanked_SDD` views.
- This modification allowed the report to display the necessary information regarding files containing passwords.

## Notes
- Ensure that when creating reports, the correct views are selected to capture all relevant data.
- Future users should verify the configuration of their reports against the available data views to avoid similar issues.
- It may be beneficial to document any specific configurations or settings that lead to successful report generation for reference in future cases.
