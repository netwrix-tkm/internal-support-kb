## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2WQPIA3
- **Case Number:** 417129
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Sean Steinberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported multiple error messages while generating reports in the FileSystem module, specifically during the FS_CleanupAssessment and FileSystemOverview processes. The errors included messages indicating no columns available for display and issues with publishing reports due to multiple matching elements.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed error messages encountered during report generation:
   - "No columns available for the table:'SA_FS_CleanupAssessment_ShareSummary' to display data."
   - "Error while publishing report. Exiting with message: Sequence contains more than one matching element."
2. Investigated the TempDB storage capacity within the filegroup.
3. Checked for potential corruption of job IDs during the upgrade process.
4. Attempted to recreate the File System Overview job and copy analysis tasks and reports from the preexisting job.

## Root Cause
- The issue with FS_CleanupAssessment was caused by insufficient TempDB storage capacity within the filegroup.
- The problem with FileSystemOverview was linked to a possibly corrupted job ID during the upgrade.

## Solution
- For FS_CleanupAssessment, the issue was resolved by increasing the TempDB storage capacity.
- For FileSystemOverview, the resolution involved recreating the job from scratch, importing the analysis tasks, and rebuilding the custom report to target the desired table.

## Notes
- It was noted that rebooting the SQL server after making changes to the SQL host Pagefile (switching from capped 12GB to system managed on the C:) may alleviate related issues, such as the generation of the Share Details summary report and the host list summary report.
- Future cases should consider checking TempDB storage capacity and job ID integrity during upgrades to prevent similar issues.
