- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dotnext South Africa
- **Contact Name:** Ziyaad Rasool
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested the database schema for integration with PowerBI to understand the available data. They specifically asked for a PDF document containing the mappings.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Previous Version Documentation Available:** 11.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the availability of schema documentation for StealthAUDIT version 11.0.
2. Communicated with the Technical Documentation team regarding the availability of schema documentation for versions 11.5 and 11.6.
3. Advised the customer to utilize third-party tools, such as DBeaver, to create an ER diagram of the actual database and select necessary tables.

## Root Cause
The absence of schema documentation for versions beyond 11.0 was identified as the root cause of the customer's inability to access the required database schema for version 11.6.

## Solution
The customer was provided with the schema documentation for StealthAUDIT version 11.0. Additionally, they were advised to use third-party tools like DBeaver to generate an ER diagram of the database for version 11.6, allowing them to select the specific tables they needed.

## Notes
- There is currently no schema documentation available for versions 11.5 or 11.6, and creating such documentation would require significant collaboration from the R&D team.
- Customers should be encouraged to explore third-party tools for database schema visualization and analysis when official documentation is not available.
