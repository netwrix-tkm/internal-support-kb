- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Independent Bank
- **Contact Name:** Shawn Pratt
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in modifying a report to display only the last three months of job activity instead of all results dating back to 2017. The report in question is called "change overview."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current report settings to understand the timeframe configuration.
2. Discussed potential methods to filter the report results based on the desired timeframe.
3. Suggested using a snapshot feature to limit the report to the last three months of activity.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the report's default configuration, which was set to display all historical data since the job's creation in 2017. The customer needed guidance on how to adjust the timeframe for the report.

## Solution
The customer was able to utilize a snapshot of the timeframe feature within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to successfully filter the report results to show only the last three months of activity. This approach met the customer's requirements without needing extensive changes to the report setup.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers about the snapshot feature as a viable solution for timeframe adjustments in reports.
- Future requests for similar modifications should consider the default settings of reports and the available filtering options within the Netwrix platform.
