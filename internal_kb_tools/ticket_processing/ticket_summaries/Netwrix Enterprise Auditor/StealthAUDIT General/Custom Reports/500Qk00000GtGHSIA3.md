## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GtGHSIA3
- **Case Number:** 423610
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Marsh & McLennan Companies
- **Contact Name:** Kay Groth
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Custom Reports
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
After upgrading to version 11.6, the customer reported that published reports were throwing an error: "Unexpected exception: Encountered error: 'Sequence contains more than one matching element'" while generating reports. Although the reports seemed to work, they failed to generate correctly.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Version:** 11.6.0.98

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
2. Attempted to delete and recreate the problematic reports.
3. Closed all instances of NEA.
4. Made a backup of the Reports folder located at `STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports`.
5. Either renamed or deleted the Reports folder from the above location.
6. Restarted NEA.
7. Ran the FMS Mercer Jobs group without attempting to publish the reports.

## Root Cause
The root cause was not definitively identified, but it was suspected that the issue stemmed from the Reports.xml file being in an unsupported structure, particularly for the FMS Mercer group jobs. This suggested that there might be multiple jobs with the same name within the group, which is not supported.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by following these steps:
- Closed all instances of NEA.
- Backed up the Reports folder.
- Deleted or renamed the Reports folder.
- Restarted NEA.
- Ran the FMS Mercer Jobs group without publishing the reports.

This process allowed the system to regenerate the Reports folder correctly, resolving the error encountered during report generation.

## Notes
- Ensure that there are no duplicate job names within the FMS Mercer group to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist, consider checking the Reports.xml file for duplicate entries or unsupported structures.
- Always back up important folders before making significant changes to avoid data loss.
