## Problem Description
The customer reported that they did not receive their monthly audit report, which is typically delivered on the 1st of every month.

## Environment Details

## Troubleshooting Steps

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a change in the email server settings that no longer aligned with the Auditor server settings, resulting in failed email deliveries.
