- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in identifying shares or folders that have not been scanned for a certain period of time, as they believed there was legacy data related to some hosts still present in their database.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Build Number:** 11.5.1331

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to clarify the requirements.
2. Suggested testing in a lab environment to determine the feasibility of running a report or query.
3. Provided a link to a knowledge base article for cleaning up host data.
4. Discussed the possibility of identifying sub-folders that have not been scanned.
5. Recommended deleting all data related to the specific host and rerunning FSAA scans for fresh data.
6. Advised taking a backup/snapshot of the database and application server before proceeding with deletions.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the presence of legacy data in the database related to certain hosts, which the customer wanted to clean up. The inability to identify unscanned shares or folders was due to the lack of a straightforward query for that specific requirement.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer to:
- Use a provided query to identify shares that have not been scanned for a specified number of days.
- If results were found, create another query to delete these entries.
- Ultimately, delete all data related to the specific host in question and rerun the FSAA scans to gather fresh data.
- Follow the instructions in the provided knowledge base article for cleaning up the database.

## Notes
- It is crucial to back up the database and application server before performing any deletions.
- For custom queries to identify sub-folders that have not been scanned, the customer may need to engage professional services, as this would require custom work.
