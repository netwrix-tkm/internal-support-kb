- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
- **Contact Name:** Andrew Kim
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with permission scanning errors and problems with FSAA system scans following an upgrade from StealthAUDIT 11.5 to 11.6.

## Environment Details
- The upgrade involved multiple components, including the Enterprise Auditor, AIC, Sensitive Data, and Activity Monitor.
- The environment included a NetApp server with network shares.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified that the FSAA system scan was running for extended periods before aborting due to access denied errors on certain shares/subfolders.
2. Held bulk imports until the scan could complete.
3. Investigated the installation directory of FSAA proxies, which were found to be in a different location than originally scanned.
4. Uninstalled and reinstalled FSAA proxies on designated drives with increased storage space.
5. Added folder and share exclusions for problematic shares causing access denied errors.
6. Reviewed job logs and discovered that a scheduled FSAA task was timing out and initiating a secondary scan.
7. Modified query properties of the FSAA scan to prevent restarts and allow continuation from where the scan left off.
8. Restarted the scan and monitored its progress.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was identified as access denied errors on network shares due to permission settings. Additionally, the FSAA proxies were installed in an incorrect directory, leading to storage issues during the tier 2 data compression process.

## Solution
- The FSAA proxies were reinstalled in the correct directory with sufficient storage space.
- Folder and share exclusions were implemented for shares causing access denied errors.
- Adjustments were made to the FSAA scan settings to allow continuation of scans rather than restarting.
- After these changes, the FSAA system scan was able to progress past the previously problematic network share.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the FSAA system scan closely after upgrades and to generate a process dump if hangs occur again.
- Ensure that all shares and folders are accessible and properly configured before initiating scans to avoid similar issues in the future.
- For future upgrades, conduct a preflight meeting to assess readiness and potential issues.
