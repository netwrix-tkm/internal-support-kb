## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GQ2HtIAL
- **Case Number:** 422399
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ThinkCloud
- **Contact Name:** Jackson Tee
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Web Console
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with logging into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) web portal. They were unsure if any specific settings were required for access, as the certification portal and help center did not provide clear guidance.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.90

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the customerâ€™s access settings and configurations.
2. Checked the documentation on the certification portal and help center for any missing instructions.
3. Investigated the authentication requirements for the NEA web portal.
4. Confirmed that the NEA Webserver requires domain authentication.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the NEA web portal requiring domain authentication, which was not clearly specified in the available documentation. The configuration file for the web server needed to be modified to allow local Windows account logins.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the `WebServer.exe.config` file located at:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Web
```
The change involved setting the value for `WindowsAuthentication` to `true`, which enabled the customer to log in using a local Windows account.

## Notes
- Ensure that future documentation clearly specifies the authentication requirements for accessing the NEA web portal.
- It may be beneficial to provide a checklist for customers to verify their settings before reaching out for support.
