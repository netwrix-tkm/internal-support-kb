## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2pUdIAJ
- **Case Number:** 417131
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society
- **Contact Name:** Jeremy Kaiser
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a customized report intended to email Active Directory (AD) accounts expiring within 30 days was not identifying certain users that were about to expire. The issue was intermittent, affecting only some accounts.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the SQL script used for the report generation.
2. Analyzed the date range logic within the SQL script to identify any discrepancies.
3. Compared the SQL logic with a similar report that captures accounts expiring within the last 14 days.
4. Ran the report multiple times to confirm the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as an incorrect date range in the SQL script for the Analysis task. The script was set to target a range of dates that included both future and past dates, rather than focusing solely on accounts expiring within the specified 30-day window. Additionally, a similar report for the last 14 days was incorrectly configured to capture only 7 days.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by modifying the SQL script to correctly filter accounts based on their expiration dates. The following changes were made:

```sql
AND X.[DaysUntilExpiration] >= 0
AND [AccountExpires] >= getdate()
```

After implementing these changes, the report was re-run, and it successfully displayed the correct range of accounts that were set to expire within the next 30 days.

## Notes
- Ensure that SQL scripts for reports are thoroughly reviewed for date range logic to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to test reports after any modifications to confirm they are functioning as intended before finalizing changes.
