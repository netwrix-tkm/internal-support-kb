- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Pension Boards United Church of Christ
- **Contact Name:** Johnnie Lopez
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Custom Reports
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in creating a custom report that would display members of a specific Active Directory (AD) group and the other groups to which those users belong, including security and distribution groups.

## Environment Details
- The report was to be generated using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).
- The customer was specifically interested in the "Domain Admins" group and its members.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Clarified the customer's requirements regarding the report structure.
2. Created a SQL script to generate the required report using existing NEA documentation.
3. Assisted the customer in configuring the report settings within the NEA console.
4. Provided guidance on how to export the report data to CSV for easier printing.
5. Addressed issues related to email notifications and SMTP settings for report delivery.

## Root Cause
The initial report configuration was set to pull data from group folder access rather than the intended Organizational Units (OUs). The customer needed the report to reflect OU membership instead.

## Solution
- A custom SQL script was created to generate the report based on the specified AD group and its members. The script included the following SQL commands:
  ```sql
  -- Create table
  SELECT * INTO SA_Custom_Group_Membership 
  FROM (
      SELECT GroupSamAccountName, MemberSamAccountName 
      FROM dbo.SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView 
      WHERE MemberSamAccountName IN (
          SELECT MemberSamAccountName 
          FROM dbo.SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView 
          WHERE GroupSamAccountName = 'Domain Admins'
      )
  ) AS tmp;

  -- Clear table contents
  TRUNCATE TABLE SA_Custom_Group_Membership;

  -- Populate table
  INSERT INTO SA_Custom_Group_Membership 
  SELECT * 
  FROM (
      SELECT GroupSamAccountName, MemberSamAccountName 
      FROM dbo.SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView 
      WHERE MemberSamAccountName IN (
          SELECT MemberSamAccountName 
          FROM dbo.SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView 
          WHERE GroupSamAccountName = 'Domain Admins'
      )
  ) AS tmp;
  ```
- The customer was instructed on how to configure email notifications for the report and how to export the report data as CSV for printing.

## Notes
- The customer expressed concerns regarding the lack of pre-configured reports for SOC2 financial audits, emphasizing the importance of having OU data available in reports.
- It was noted that OUs are not directly tracked in NEA, and any custom reporting related to OUs would require professional services assistance for tailored scripts.
- The customer was advised to contact their account manager for further assistance with professional services.
