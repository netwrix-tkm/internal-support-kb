```

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. Identified that some hosts were offline or decommissioned.
4. Confirmed that the credentials did not have access to some online and functional hosts.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by a combination of offline or decommissioned hosts and insufficient access permissions for the credentials used to connect to the online hosts.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Ensuring that all hosts required for the reporting task were online and operational.
- Updating the credentials to ensure they had the necessary access rights to all relevant hosts.

## Notes
- It is important to regularly verify the status of hosts and the permissions of credentials used in reporting tasks to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing monitoring for host availability and credential access to streamline troubleshooting efforts.
