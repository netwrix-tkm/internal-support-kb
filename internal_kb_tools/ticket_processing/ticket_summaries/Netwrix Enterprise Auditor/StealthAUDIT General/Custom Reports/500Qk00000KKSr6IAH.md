- **Case Number:** 431375
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TELCOR Inc
- **Contact Name:** Josh Brokaw
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a custom Stealthbits Activity Monitor report was completing successfully but did not display any current data or activity when viewed in the report details.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) environment.
- The customer was suspected to have licensing limitations affecting the report functionality.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the completion status of the custom report in StealthAudit.
2. Checked the FSAC System scan log for errors related to data collection.
3. Advised the customer to review their licensing for StealthAudit/NEA.
4. Confirmed that the report may have been a remnant from a 2020 demo.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a licensing limitation. The customer was not licensed for File System Reports in NEA, only for File Activity in NAM. Additionally, the errors in the FSAC System scan log indicated that the 'FILESYSTEMACCESS' data collector was not installed, which prevented the report from retrieving current data.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming the licensing status and informing the customer that they did not have the necessary licenses for File System Reports. It was suggested that the report in question was likely a leftover from a previous demo conducted in 2020. The customer was advised to review their licensing options to enable the required features.

## Notes
- Future cases involving similar issues should start with a verification of the customer's licensing for StealthAudit/NEA.
- It is important to check for any remnants of demo reports that may not align with the current licensing.
- Ensure that all necessary data collectors are installed and configured correctly to avoid similar issues.
