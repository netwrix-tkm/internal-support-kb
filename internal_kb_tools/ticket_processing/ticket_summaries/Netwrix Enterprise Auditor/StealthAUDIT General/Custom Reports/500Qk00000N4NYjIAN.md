## Problem Description
The customer reported discrepancies between actionable file counts and moved file counts during move jobs on the AWSRP05 and PWSSTAP05 servers. In some instances, the number of files moved was significantly lower than the actionable file count.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on multiple servers, specifically AWSRP05 and PWSSTAP05.
- Errors such as "The system cannot find the file specified" were noted in the job logs.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran a scan job on the AWSRP05 and PWSSTAP05 servers to identify actionable files.
2. Initiated a move job to transfer actionable files to the designated quarantine location.
3. Monitored the move job and noted the number of files successfully moved versus the actionable file count.
4. Reviewed job logs for errors and discrepancies between actionable and moved file counts.
5. Proposed a fresh scan and move job to reset the environment and monitor for changes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the discrepancies was not definitively identified. However, it was suggested that missing steps or dependencies in the job setup process could be contributing factors. The logs and job data reviewed showed no abnormalities in the scan or report generation processes, indicating that the issue was isolated to the move job execution.

## Solution
The issue was not resolved during the initial troubleshooting. The customer was advised to run a fresh scan and move job to monitor for any changes in file counts. The customer planned to create a new ticket for the next host-level job to ensure proper setup and monitoring during execution.

## Notes
- It was confirmed that the missing files were not present in the quarantine location, ruling out the possibility that they were moved successfully but misreported.
- The customer should ensure that all steps and dependencies are correctly configured in future job setups to avoid similar discrepancies.
- A follow-up is necessary after the next scheduled job run to determine if the discrepancies persist.
