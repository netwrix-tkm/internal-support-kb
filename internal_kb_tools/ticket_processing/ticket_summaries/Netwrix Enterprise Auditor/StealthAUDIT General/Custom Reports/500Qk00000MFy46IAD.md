- **Case Number:** 436837
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (Austin Data Center)
- **Contact Name:** Kevin Dwyer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT General
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested a report that shows user permissions for a specific file share, including the ability to select a user and view their permissions to that share.

## Environment Details
- The customer was using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5.
- The Access Information Center (AIC) was not displaying the expected folder permissions for users.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Assisted the customer in gaining admin access to the AIC.
2. Verified that the FSAA (File Share Access Audit) scan was running and configured correctly.
3. Investigated the effective access display in the AIC, noting that it only showed effective access to file shares and direct permissions, not group permissions.
4. Attempted to create a custom report in the lab to determine feasibility.
5. Communicated with internal teams to explore potential workarounds for displaying user permissions.

## Root Cause
The AIC was not configured to display all folder and subfolder permissions due to limitations in the current version of the software. The effective access only showed direct permissions and did not account for permissions granted through Active Directory groups.

## Solution
The support engineer demonstrated how to configure the AIC to populate file share permissions correctly. A custom report was proposed to meet the customer's needs, as the existing functionality did not support the requested report directly.

## Notes
- The customer was informed that creating a custom report would require additional effort and potentially professional services if complex queries were needed.
- It was noted that the request for a comprehensive report on user permissions would require comparing multiple tables, which is not supported out-of-the-box in the current version of the software.
