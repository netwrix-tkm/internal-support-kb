- **Case Number:** 420653
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** University of Cambridge
- **Contact Name:** Tara Jeffery
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** TempDB Management
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the TempDB on their SQL Server was filling up, causing failures in job executions, particularly during the execution of the `SP_DomainUsers` job.

## Environment Details
- SQL Server with a TempDB storage capacity of 1.5TB.
- The issue was noted to occur during the execution of jobs related to Active Directory Integration (ADI) and Entra ADI.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Executed SQL queries to determine TempDB file size and usage:
   ```sql
   SELECT name AS [File Name], size * 8 / 1024 AS [Size (MB)], 
          size * 8 / 1024 - CAST(FILEPROPERTY(name, 'SpaceUsed') AS INT) * 8 / 1024 AS [Available Space (MB)], 
          growth * 8 / 1024 AS [Growth (MB)], 
          max_size AS [Max Size] 
   FROM sys.master_files 
   WHERE database_id = DB_ID('tempdb');
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       s.session_id, 
       s.login_name, 
       s.host_name, 
       t.[text] AS [Query Text],
       r.total_elapsed_time, 
       r.wait_time, 
       r.wait_type,
       (r.total_elapsed_time / 1000) AS [Elapsed Time (sec)],
       (r.wait_time / 1000) AS [Wait Time (sec)],
       u.user_objects_alloc_page_count AS [User Object Alloc Pages],
       u.internal_objects_alloc_page_count AS [Internal Object Alloc Pages]
   FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions s
   INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
   INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_session_space_usage u ON s.session_id = u.session_id
   CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
   WHERE u.user_objects_alloc_page_count + u.internal_objects_alloc_page_count > 0;
   ```
2. Collected screenshots of database settings and CSV outputs for analysis.
3. Conducted meetings with the customer and internal team members to discuss findings and potential solutions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as SQL deadlocking occurring when either ADI or Entra ADI jobs were running, which led to excessive TempDB usage and ultimately filling it up.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing a modified version of the `SP_DomainUsers` job. This modification aimed to optimize the job's performance and reduce the load on TempDB. The customer was advised to monitor the performance of the modified job over several runs to ensure stability.

## Notes
- It is recommended to keep the ticket open for monitoring until a sufficient number of runs have been completed without the TempDB filling up.
- Future job implementations should consider breaking down complex calculations to avoid overwhelming TempDB.
- Ensure that any other applications using the same SQL instance are reviewed for their impact on TempDB usage.
