## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LYF5OIAX
- **Case Number:** 434860
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Reed Smith LLP
- **Contact Name:** Lenny Jones
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Exchange
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the SQL table `SA_EX_Folderdetails_DEFAULT` was only returning folder counts for approximately 1,600 mailboxes, despite having over 3,000 mailboxes in their environment. The customer was attempting to build a job to show all mailboxes and their folder counts.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within a Netwrix Enterprise Auditor environment.
- The data collection was specifically related to Exchange mailboxes.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was informed that the current method to retrieve this data was through a PowerShell script.
2. A discussion was held to gather more information and clarify the requirements for a feature request (FR).
3. A new job was created during a call to generate a new table `SA_EX_FolderCount` to provide a count of Exchange folders for each mailbox.

## Root Cause
The initial SQL query was likely limited in its scope or filtering criteria, which resulted in only a subset of mailboxes being returned. The specific cause was not explicitly identified, but it was determined that the existing table did not encompass all mailboxes.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, a new SQL job was created that populates the `SA_EX_FolderCount` table with the following SQL command:

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('SA_EX_Perms_EXO_Details_EXO', 'U') IS NOT NULL 
BEGIN 
    DROP TABLE SA_EX_Perms_EXO_Details_EXO; 
END;

SELECT DisplayName, COUNT(*) AS FolderCount 
INTO SA_EX_FolderCount 
FROM StealthAudit.dbo.[SA_EX_Perms_EXO_Details_EXO] 
WHERE UserName LIKE 'default' 
AND EmailAddressSMTP NOT LIKE 'Departed%' 
GROUP BY DisplayName;
```

This new job successfully counted the folders for all relevant mailboxes.

## Notes
- Future implementations should ensure that SQL queries are thoroughly reviewed to avoid similar limitations in data retrieval.
- It may be beneficial to document the process for creating similar jobs to facilitate quicker resolutions for similar requests in the future.
