- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Reed Smith LLP
- **Contact Name:** Lenny Jones

- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Exchange
- **Feature:** Exchange Online
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer needed guidance on how to modify an existing public folder report that was originally set up for their Exchange On-Prem environment to work with their newly migrated public folders in Exchange Online (EXO).

## Environment Details
- The customer had previously migrated their public folders from Exchange On-Prem to Exchange Online.
- The report was initially configured for the on-premises environment and required reconfiguration for the cloud environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the configurations for the EXO Public Report as detailed in the Netwrix documentation.
2. Verified that the necessary dependencies listed in the documentation were installed on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) application server.
3. Confirmed that the Active Directory Integration (ADI) and Entra ID jobs had successfully run.
4. Checked that the host list was set to localhost.
5. Recommended checking MAPI-Based Permissions as per the documentation.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as the Public Folders Job not being located within the Exchange Online group, which was necessary for the report to function correctly after the migration.

## Solution
The Public Folders Job was relocated to the Exchange Online group. After this adjustment, the jobs were successfully run, and the report was able to pull data from the public folders in Exchange Online without issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future migrations from Exchange On-Prem to Exchange Online include a review of job configurations to avoid similar issues.
- Always verify that the correct group assignments are made for jobs related to public folders in Exchange Online after migration.
