## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000C0GvWIAV
- **Case Number:** 412261
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Jones Family Office
- **Contact Name:** Carmichael Ragbir
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Exchange
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the delegates job was not properly showing results, leading to missing delegate information when compared to expected outputs from Exchange commands.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Exchange
- **Issue Type:** Guidance

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the delegate job results and compared them with the output from the Exchange command:
   ```powershell
   Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails SharedMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited |
   Get-MailboxPermission |
   Select-Object Identity, User, AccessRights |
   Where-Object { $_.User -like '*@*' } |
   Export-Csv -Path C:Tempsharedfolders.csv -NoTypeInformation
   ```
2. Modified delegate results to check if the job would pick them up, which it did, indicating a potential issue with the job configuration.
3. Consulted the Netwrix documentation for shared mailbox permissions to rule out issues on the Exchange end: [Netwrix Shared Mailbox Permissions](https://www.netwrix.com/get-shared-mailbox-permissions.html).
4. Merged Exchange permissions into a new report to consolidate results.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a configuration problem within the Netwrix job that prevented it from capturing all delegate results. The job was filtering out certain delegates, leading to incomplete reporting.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Adjusting the job configuration to ensure it captured all relevant delegate information.
- Merging the Exchange permissions into a new report to provide a comprehensive view of mailbox access rights.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future configurations of delegate jobs are thoroughly tested against expected outputs from Exchange commands to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly review and update job settings to align with changes in mailbox permissions or organizational policies.
