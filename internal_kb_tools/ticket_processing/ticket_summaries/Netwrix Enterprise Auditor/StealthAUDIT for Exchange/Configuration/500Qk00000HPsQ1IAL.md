The customer reported issues connecting to Exchange Online, experiencing PowerShell and SQL errors similar to a previous case (00423763).

## Environment Details

- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.112

6. Adjusted the configuration file at `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Web\WebServer.exe.config` to set the Windows Authentication value to True.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correctly configuring the "Credential Profile" for Exchange jobs.
- Ensuring appropriate permissions were set for the App Registration in EntraID.
- Installing the necessary PowerShell module to eliminate errors.
- Modifying job properties to ensure they could run without skipping unresponsive hosts.
- Updating the host list for Sensitive Data discovery jobs to the correct endpoint.
- Adjusting the web server configuration to enable Windows Authentication.
