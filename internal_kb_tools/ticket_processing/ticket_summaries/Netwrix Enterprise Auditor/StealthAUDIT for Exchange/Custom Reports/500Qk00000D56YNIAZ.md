- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D56YNIAZ
- **Case Number:** 414981
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Federated Hermes
- **Contact Name:** Dennis Nicholson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Exchange
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The Exchange Distribution List Report "SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount" was incorrectly displaying all zeroes for both groups with managers and groups without managers.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor platform, specifically using the StealthAUDIT for Exchange component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment revealed that the report was returning zero counts for all groups.
2. A meeting was scheduled to discuss the issue and review the SQL script used for the report.
3. The SQL script was exported from StealthAUDIT for analysis.
4. During the meeting, it was noted that the `managedbyprincipalid` column was missing from the `MailEnabledGroupListingWithManager` table.
5. Adjustments were made to the SQL script to ensure it counted correctly.
6. The SQL script was reviewed and corrected to use the appropriate tables and columns.

## Root Cause
The SQL analysis script used in the job was incorrect, leading to the report returning zero counts for both groups with and without managers.

## Solution
Paul Pitas corrected the SQL script to accurately reference the correct tables and columns for counting the groups. The updated script is as follows:

```sql
IF OBJECT_ID('[SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount]','table') IS NULL
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount](
    [Description] [varchar](64) NOT NULL,
    [SecurityGroupCount] INT NULL,
    [DistributionGroupCount] INT NULL,
    [TotalGroupCount] INT NULL
) ELSE TRUNCATE TABLE SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount;

INSERT INTO SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount
SELECT DISTINCT
    'Groups Without Manager' as [Description],
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupSMTP]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingNoManager WHERE GroupTarget = 'Security') as SecurityGroupCount,
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupSMTP]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingNoManager WHERE GroupTarget = 'Distribution') as DistributionGroupCount,
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupSMTP]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingNoManager) as TotalGroupCount

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Groups With Manager',
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupManagerDisplayName]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingWithManager WHERE [GroupManagerDisplayName] <>'No Manager' AND GroupTarget = 'Security') as SecurityGroupCount,
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupManagerDisplayName]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingWithManager WHERE [GroupManagerDisplayName] <> 'No Manager' AND GroupTarget = 'Distribution') as DistributionGroupCount,
    (SELECT COUNT([GroupManagerDisplayName]) FROM SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupListingWithManager WHERE [GroupManagerDisplayName] <> 'No Manager') as TotalGroupCount;
```

## Notes
- Ensure that any future custom reports are thoroughly reviewed for SQL script accuracy before deployment.
- Be aware of potential missing columns in the database schema that may affect report generation.
- Regularly validate the output of reports to catch discrepancies early.
