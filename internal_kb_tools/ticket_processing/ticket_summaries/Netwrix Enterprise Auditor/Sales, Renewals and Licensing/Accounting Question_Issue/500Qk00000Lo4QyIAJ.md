## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Lo4QyIAJ
- **Case Number:** 435649
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Veterans United Home Loans
- **Contact Name:** Randy Raw
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Sales, Renewals and Licensing
- **Feature:** Accounting Question/Issue
- **Version:** 10.0

## Problem Description
The customer requested the removal of their support account, as they had not been a customer for a couple of years. They also asked to verify that no other users with specific email addresses were active.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Email Domains in Question:** `@vu.com`, `@veteransunited.com`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer emailed privacy@netwrix.com to request account deletion and confirmation of the request.
2. Follow-up emails were sent to privacy@netwrix.com for updates on the deletion request.
3. Legal confirmed that a deletion request was submitted, but only the client's contact was removed from Salesforce (SF).
4. Checked the Account Control Panel site, which indicated that the account was still active.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of communication regarding the status of the deletion request. Although legal had submitted the request, the account remained active due to incomplete processing of the request.

## Solution
The case was escalated to legal as a data rights request. After confirming the necessary actions were taken, the ticket was closed as resolved, with instructions to ensure that the account deletion was processed.

## Notes
- Ensure that all deletion requests are tracked and confirmed to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is important to maintain clear communication with legal and the customer regarding the status of such requests.
- Consider implementing a follow-up mechanism for pending deletion requests to improve response times.
