## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in running a scan across all hosts to identify if the "IS Local Administrators" group is a member of the local administrators group.

## Environment Details
The customer is licensed for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Windows Solution, which includes a job designed to gather the required information.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the customer is licensed for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Windows Solution.
2. Instructed the customer to navigate to the following path in the NEA Console: 
   - `Windows > Privileged Accounts > SG_LocalAdmins`
3. Explained that the job targets all Windows servers (excluding Domain Controllers) by default.
4. Advised the customer to run the job and check the results under the Results node beneath the job.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of knowledge on how to utilize the existing functionality within their licensed product to achieve their goal.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by guiding the customer to use the pre-existing job `SG_LocalAdmins` within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is specifically designed to identify group memberships for local administrators. The customer was able to run the job successfully and retrieve the necessary information.

## Notes
- It is important to clarify the intended use of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, as it is not designed for scanning all workstations indiscriminately.
- Future customers should be directed to explore existing jobs within their licensed solutions before seeking additional assistance.
