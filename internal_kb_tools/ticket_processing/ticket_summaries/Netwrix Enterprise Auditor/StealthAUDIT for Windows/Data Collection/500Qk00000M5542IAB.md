## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M5542IAB
- **Case Number:** 436348
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Axos Bank
- **Contact Name:** Al Maravillas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported intermittent RPC errors while scanning approximately 1000 hosts daily. When these errors occurred, the `SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details` table would drop the data for any hosts that encountered issues during the most recent collection, requiring a subsequent successful run to retrieve the previously collected data.

## Environment Details
- **Analysis Task:** SG_LocalAdmins
- **Data Collection Frequency:** More than once a day for at least 1000 hosts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the SG_LocalAdmins analysis task.
2. Verified successful data collection on hosts, confirming that the `SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details` table displayed all collected information.
3. Re-ran the SG_LocalAdmins task to check for changes in group membership.
4. Encountered RPC errors on some hosts, resulting in the `SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details` table only showing data for successful hosts and dropping all others.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a missing functionality in the analysis task that did not retain previous successful host audits when a failure occurred during the most recent run.

## Solution
A custom job was developed and delivered to the customer, which modified the analysis task to retain the most recent successful information for hosts, even if a failure occurred in subsequent runs. Additionally, a fix was packaged into the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA v11.6.0.133) to address this issue.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar RPC errors should consider upgrading to NEA v11.6.0.133 or later to benefit from the fix.
- It is recommended to monitor the performance of the SG_LocalAdmins task after implementing the changes to ensure stability and reliability in data collection.
