- **Case Number:** 421877
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Schlumberger Technology Corporation (SLB)
- **Contact Name:** Sherry Lie
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the FSAC scan failed in the SA console, with an error indicating that the system was unable to start the scan due to a failure in retrieving the INI file path from the registry for the specified network path.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Build Number:** 11.5.1338.932

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message indicating the inability to find the INI file path from the registry.
2. Investigated the network path to ensure it was accessible.
3. Checked for previous similar issues and resolutions in the support database.
4. Discussed configuration settings with the customer to ensure proper setup of the SA server as a proxy server for scanning.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration where the Netwrix product could not locate the SBTFileMon.ini file for the specified agent (AU0121CDS01.dir.slb.com) in the NAM (Network Access Management).

## Solution
The issue was resolved by configuring the SA server correctly as a proxy server to scan the Windows share server and the Nasuni server. Documentation and relevant links were shared with the customer, and the configuration was discussed in a meeting to ensure proper implementation.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SBTFileMon.ini file is correctly placed and accessible for all agents to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify network paths and configurations when setting up proxy servers for scanning to prevent access-related errors.
