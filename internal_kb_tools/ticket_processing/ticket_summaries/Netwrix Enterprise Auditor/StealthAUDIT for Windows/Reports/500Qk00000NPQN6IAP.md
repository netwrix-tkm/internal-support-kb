## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NPQN6IAP
- **Case Number:** 440251
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Axos Bank
- **Contact Name:** Alan A. Moreno
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The SG_LocalAdmins job was not reflecting changes for deleted or disabled users, as these users continued to appear as active in the SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details table. The last audit date for these users was stale, showing "2025-03-19 06:00:00".

## Environment Details
- Customized workflow by ProServ.
- The issue was observed across multiple Windows hosts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the LocalAdmins job and observed multiple audit dates in the _Details table.
2. Renamed the old _Details table to preserve data while troubleshooting.
3. Executed the job against a smaller host to successfully rebuild the _Details table.
4. Configured the job to run against all Windows hosts to identify current issues.
5. Investigated logs and confirmed that some hosts were erroring, leading to cluttered data.
6. Cleared the _Details tables and rebuilt them.
7. Verified permissions and protocols with the customer.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by several erroring hosts that prevented the scan from updating correctly. Only successful scans update the _Details table, leading to stale data for users who had been removed from local admin groups.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing the _Details tables and rebuilding them.
- Ensuring the job was configured correctly to run against all Windows hosts.
- Providing the customer with the necessary permissions and protocols required for the job to function correctly.

## Notes
- Future scans should be monitored to ensure that all hosts are reporting correctly.
- If issues persist, the ticket can be reopened within 30 days for further investigation.
- Ensure that the log level is set to debug for more detailed troubleshooting in future cases.
