- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that while running a scan, data was successfully retrieved from the target server, but the report was not being generated. The error observed indicated that the specified path or file name was too long.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while generating reports for Local Administrators using a Windows Job group.
- The report generation was affected by the Windows file path limitations.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the report name/title and path of report storage to ensure they did not exceed character limits (260 characters for file names and 248 characters for paths).
2. Checked the job configuration and logs for any errors related to path length.
3. Attempted to increase the Max Path limit of Windows by modifying the registry key:
   ```plaintext
   Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled
   ```
4. Rebooted the server after making the registry change, but the issue persisted.
5. Moved the job to a higher directory in the hierarchy to reduce the overall path length.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the Windows file path limitation. The job was nested within too many directories, resulting in a fully qualified file name that exceeded the maximum allowed length.

## Solution
To resolve the issue:
- The job was moved two directories up in the hierarchy, significantly reducing the path length.
- After relocating the job, it was executed successfully, and the report was generated without any errors.

## Notes
- Windows has a native limitation on file path lengths, which differs from Linux systems. This should be considered when configuring jobs in Netwrix products.
- For future reference, ensure that job paths and file names are kept well within the character limits to avoid similar issues.
