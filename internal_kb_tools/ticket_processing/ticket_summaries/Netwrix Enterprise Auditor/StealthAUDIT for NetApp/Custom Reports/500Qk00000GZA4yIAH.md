## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GZA4yIAH
- **Case Number:** 422776
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ConocoPhillips Company
- **Contact Name:** Frank McNickle
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Custom Reports
- **Feature:** Custom Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in expanding a report that shows folder permission changes to include all shares, as the current report only displayed user directories.

## Environment Details
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the existing report to identify its limitations in displaying only local folders.
2. Engaged with the customer to clarify the requirements for including top-level share permissions.
3. Investigated whether the report adjustments could be made easily or if professional services would be required.
4. Scheduled meetings with the customer to discuss the report modifications and gather feedback.
5. Created a new report that included permission changes for shares over the last week.

## Root Cause
The initial report was configured to only pull data from local folders, which did not meet the customer's requirement for a comprehensive view of permission changes across all shares.

## Solution
A new report was developed that successfully included permission changes for the top two levels of shares. This report was tested and confirmed to meet the customer's needs. Additionally, a plan was established for setting up a weekly emailed report based on the results.

## Notes
- Ensure that future reports are configured to include both local folders and shares to avoid similar issues.
- The customer expressed interest in further enhancements, such as simplifying password changes for the Netwrix Activity Monitor, which may require additional follow-up.
- It is advisable to disable any duplicate reports to prevent confusion and unnecessary email notifications.
