## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GG0EAIA1
- **Case Number:** 422123
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Continental Resources, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Phi Tran
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when running the Broken Inheritance Job, specifically: "Invalid object name 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_Details'. Could not use view or function 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_UniqueTrustees' because of binding errors." This issue was previously noted in another support case (00382569), where a workaround involved replacing the job with an older version.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Build Number:** 11.5
- The issue could not be reproduced in the support engineer's lab environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message and confirmed it was related to the database objects.
2. Investigated the customer's environment, noting that the `#tmpPaths` and `permissionsComparison` tables contained data.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue in a lab environment using the same version as the customer but was unsuccessful.
4. Consulted previous support cases for potential solutions and workarounds.
5. Recommended upgrading to the latest version (11.6) and dropping any existing tables/views with the prefix "FS_BrokenInheritance".

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a defect in the product version 11.5, which caused binding errors with the database objects related to the Broken Inheritance Job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by advising the customer to upgrade to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (11.6) and to manually drop any tables or views in the database that began with the prefix "FS_BrokenInheritance". This step was necessary to ensure a clean slate for the job to run without errors.

## Notes
- The customer decided not to proceed with the upgrade as their StealthAUDIT license was set to expire at the end of April 2025.
- Future customers experiencing similar issues should be advised to upgrade to the latest version and clear any conflicting database objects to avoid binding errors.
