## Problem Description
During a professional services engagement, an error message was identified that caused a long-running NetApp scan to fail. The issue was reported by Paul Pitas and included log data for further investigation.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message logs attached to the ticket.
2. Investigated the specific error: `System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded`.
3. Analyzed the stack trace to identify potential causes related to scan session management.
4. Communicated with the customer to confirm if the issue persisted.
5. Monitored the system for any further occurrences of the error.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was associated with a timeout error during the processing of a scan status request, indicating potential issues with session management or network latency.

## Solution
The issue was resolved without a specific fix being applied, as the error was no longer occurring after monitoring. It is suggested that the system was able to recover from the timeout condition, or that subsequent scans were executed under improved conditions.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor long-running scans for timeout errors, especially in environments with high network latency or resource contention.
- Future investigations should include a review of session management and timeout settings to prevent similar issues.
- Ensure that log data is consistently attached to support tickets for effective troubleshooting.
