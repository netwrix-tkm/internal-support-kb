## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OLq94IAD
- **Case Number:** 442858
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Thales Group Australia
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Heaton-Harris
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 12.0.0.153

## Problem Description
After upgrading from version 11.6.0.141 to 12.0.0.153, the customer reported that manually running jobs resulted in errors. Specifically, two errors were encountered:
1. **Error 1:** `GetFSACIniAttributeValue: Error: Ini section for [Windows file server] does not exist in ini file [Windows file server]C$ProgramDataNetwrixActivity MonitorAgent/SBTFileMon.ini`
2. **Error 2:** `Unable to start scan: Proxy host list is either empty or no proxies were configured to scan the target host`

## Environment Details
- The upgrade was performed on the Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA).
- There was a mismatch for the hostname in NAA and NAM for the host being scanned.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error messages and identified the missing INI section.
2. Provided the customer with a knowledge base article regarding the INI section error.
3. Instructed the customer to run the `0.Create Schema` job to address the schema update error.
4. Conducted a meeting to verify the existence of the referenced SQL tables.
5. Modified SQL queries to ensure they referenced the correct database tables.
6. Attempted to run SQL commands to disable and enable constraints on the relevant tables.

## Root Cause
The issues were primarily caused by:
- Missing INI sections in the configuration file after the upgrade.
- Schema updates not being applied correctly due to the upgrade process, leading to mismatches in the database structure.

## Solution
1. The customer was guided to run the following SQL commands to disable constraints:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ```
2. After disabling the constraints, the `0.Create Schema` job was executed successfully.
3. Finally, the constraints were re-enabled with the following commands:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct host lists and proxy settings are in place after an upgrade, as these may change during the process.
- Always verify the existence of necessary database tables and their structures before running jobs that depend on them.
- If errors persist, check for permission issues on the SQL server, as the customer reported a message indicating that certain objects could not be found or accessed.
