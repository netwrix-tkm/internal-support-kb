- **Case Number:** 435045
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hydro Group Norway
- **Contact Name:** Saveetha Anesh
- **Product:** Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly known as Enterprise Auditor)
- **Component:** FSAA Scans
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving the error message "Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol" during FSAA scans for several NetApp hosts across the NHY and GLOBAL domains.

## Environment Details
- Affected NetApp hosts:
  - From GLOBAL domain:
    - BBI01-NS012
    - CAKENICS-OFS012
    - CARUAICS-OFS012
    - MAG01-NS012
    - USSPDICS-OFS012
  - From NHY domain:
    - PSG00-NS012
    - DKTO3PV-NAO012
    - FIN00-NS012
- Proxy servers used for scanning:
  - GLOBAL:
    - FRBBIPV-IMS02
    - CAKENPV-IMS02
    - CARUAPV-IMS02
    - NOMAGPV-IMS02
    - USSPDPV-IMS02
  - NHY:
    - FRBDCPV-IMS02
    - DKTO1PV-IMS02
    - SEMYRPV-IMS02

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified network connectivity and opened ports (445 and 135) between the StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
2. Confirmed successful WMI connection tests.
3. Tested the connection to IPC$ shares using a PowerShell script with the "GLOBALs-stealthnetapp" account.
4. Identified that the "GLOBALs-stealthnetapp" account failed to access IPC$ shares for some target hosts while succeeding for others.
5. Engaged the customer to contact their Networking and NetApp teams for further investigation.
6. Suggested checking DNS records and ensuring that the problematic NetApp hosts could be resolved without FQDN.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be related to DNS name resolution. The Test-NetConnection command succeeded when using the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) but failed when using only the NetApp name. This indicated that the problematic NetApp hosts required FQDN for successful connectivity.

## Solution
The customer worked with their DNS team to create the necessary DNS records for the problematic NetApp hosts in both the NHY and GLOBAL domains. After the DNS records were created, the FSAA scans were successful, resolving the connectivity issues.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary DNS records are created for NetApp hosts to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify that both FQDN and hostname resolutions work as expected for all relevant hosts in the environment.
- If issues persist after DNS changes, further investigation into network configurations and permissions may be required.
