## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M3caOIAR
- **Case Number:** 436257
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hydro Group Norway
- **Contact Name:** Saveetha Anesh
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that decommissioned NetApp hosts, which had been removed from host management, still appeared in the NetApp Open Access report. They requested assistance on how to remove these decommissioned hosts from the report.

## Environment Details
- The issue was related to the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and specifically involved the StealthAUDIT for NetApp component.
- The customer was using version 11.5 of the product.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the decommissioned NetApp hosts were removed from host management.
2. Suggested creating a job to remove data for the decommissioned NetApp hosts from the StealthAudit database.
3. Followed the steps outlined in the knowledge base article: [How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html) to create a new job.
4. Initiated a remote session to run the job that would remove the specified hosts' data.
5. Informed the customer that they would need to re-run the "Open Access" job to generate a new report after the data removal.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the Open Access report is generated based on data from all hosts scanned during FSAA permission scan jobs. Since the data for the decommissioned hosts still existed in the NEA database, they continued to appear in the report.

## Solution
The solution involved creating a new job that executed two tasks:
- A query to remove data related to the specified decommissioned NetApp hosts from the StealthAudit database.
- An analysis task to verify which hosts remained in the database, ensuring that the decommissioned hosts were successfully removed.

Once the data for the decommissioned hosts was removed, the customer was advised to re-run the "Open Access" job to generate an updated report that would no longer include the decommissioned hosts.

## Notes
- An alternative method to handle similar cases is to create a custom report based on the "FS_OpenAccess" job report, allowing the customer to filter out decommissioned hosts without removing their data from the database.
- It is important to ensure that the job settings are configured correctly, particularly the option to skip hosts that do not respond to pings, as this can affect the job's execution.
