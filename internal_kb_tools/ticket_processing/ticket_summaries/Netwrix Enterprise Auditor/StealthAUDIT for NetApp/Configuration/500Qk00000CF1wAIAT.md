## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CF1wAIAT
- **Case Number:** 412846
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Jerad Ware
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer, Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company, was migrating their network storage from Isilon to NetApp and sought guidance on how to ensure that sensitive data and activity data would not be lost during the migration process.

## Environment Details
- Previous NAS: Isilon
- New NAS: NetApp
- Product Version: 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed with the customer whether the new NAS was named differently from the previous NAS.
2. Informed the customer that there was no need to migrate data as it would remain searchable in the database under the old server's name.
3. Provided documentation links for setting up permissions and activity monitoring on the new NetApp server.

## Root Cause
The initial concern stemmed from the customer's misunderstanding of the data migration process. Since the new NetApp was named differently, the data would still be accessible under the old server's name in the Netwrix database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying that no data migration was necessary due to the naming convention. The customer was provided with links to relevant documentation for setting up permissions and activity monitoring on the new NetApp server:
- [Permissions and Sensitive Data Setup](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm)
- [Activity Monitoring Setup](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Activity.htm)

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the implications of naming conventions when migrating to new storage solutions.
- Always provide documentation links for configuration and setup to assist customers in managing their new systems effectively.
