## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BqLVMIA3
- **Case Number:** 411975
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Howard County, MD
- **Contact Name:** Frank Salah
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when using the StealthAudit web console (AIC) to view activity for folders on their file share, it consistently returned zero results, despite records being present in the SQL view `dbo.SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView`.

## Environment Details
- The customer migrated data from an old NetApp NAS to a new NetApp with the same name, which caused issues with pathing and data visibility.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that data was being collected successfully.
2. Checked the `ActivityEvents` table in the database and confirmed that data was present.
3. Enabled the "Report UNC Paths" option on the NetApp server in Activity Monitor.
4. Ran the FSAC Bulk Import job and the FSAC Exceptions job, both of which completed successfully.
5. Identified that the new NetApp paths were slightly different from the previous ones, leading to potential permission issues.
6. Scheduled a job to drop the old server's data after 60 days.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the migration of data from the old NetApp to a new NetApp with the same name, which resulted in incorrect pathing and permissions in the database.

## Solution
1. Reconfigured permissions on the new NetApp using CIFS Method 2 Credential Configuration.
2. Renamed the old NetApp data in the NEA database to reflect the host as "OLD_HCDATASTORE.HC.HOWARDCOUNTYMD.GOV".
3. Ensured that the FSAC scan runs and imports data correctly aligned with the new permissions.
4. Scheduled a job to drop the old server's data in 60 days to prevent confusion.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future migrations of NetApp data maintain consistent pathing to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to verify permissions on the new NetApp host after migration to ensure proper data visibility.
- Consider using the "Target previously scanned DC" option in ADI queries to override the default "One Domain Controller per Domain" behavior if necessary.
