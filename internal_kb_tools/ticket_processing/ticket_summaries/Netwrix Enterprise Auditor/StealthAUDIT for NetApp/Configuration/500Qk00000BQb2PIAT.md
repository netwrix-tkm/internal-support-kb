## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BQb2PIAT
- **Case Number:** 410930
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Citizens Financial Group, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Graham
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The bulk scans for M&A partners were not functioning correctly. A specific NAS scan ran for an extended period without producing any records or results, and the scan history inaccurately reflected a scan from a month ago instead of the actual scan conducted a week prior.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Requested the customer to export and upload the scan job and import job logs for analysis.
2. Stopped both the FSAA System Scan and SEEK System Scan to prevent further table lock issues.
3. Checked for any `.lck` files in the job directories to ensure no locks were present.
4. Initiated a level 3 scan starting from the Collection group to run through the FSAA scan and FSAA bulk import before proceeding to SEEK tasks.
5. Identified a permissions issue on the DFW NAS.

## Root Cause
The simultaneous execution of the FSAA System Scan and SEEK System Scan caused table lock issues in SQL, as both scans attempted to access the same tables, leading to prolonged scan durations and failures to log results.

## Solution
- Stopped the conflicting scans and ensured no lock files were present.
- Conducted a level 3 scan from the Collection group to properly sequence the FSAA and SEEK tasks.
- Provided the customer with documentation to review and adjust permissions on the DFW NAS, ensuring all necessary permissions were granted.

## Notes
- Future scans should be scheduled to avoid overlapping tasks that access the same database tables to prevent similar locking issues.
- Ensure that permissions on NAS systems are regularly reviewed and updated to avoid access issues during scans.
