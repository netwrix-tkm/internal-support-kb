## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000BwG9KIAV
- **Case Number:** 412112
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Connie Liang
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5.0.260

## Problem Description
The 2-FSAA Bulk Import process was taking over 10 hours to complete, significantly longer than the usual 30-35 minutes. The customer reported that this delay was causing latency issues for other queries on their SQL server.

## Environment Details
- The current version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) is 11.5.0.260.
- A repair installation was performed on June 12, 2024.
- The SQL host had a recent update (KB5037763) installed, which may have contributed to the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the SQL server.
2. Checked for any overlapping host names in the configuration.
3. Investigated the SQL server performance during the bulk import process.
4. Collected logs from the bulk import job for analysis.
5. Scheduled a web meeting to discuss the issue in detail with the customer.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the prolonged bulk import times was identified as an excessive number of reads (10 billion+) during the import process, compared to the usual 6 million reads. This discrepancy indicated that the StealthAUDIT application was misbehaving, leading to inefficient processing.

## Solution
- The overlapping host names in the configuration were addressed, and it was recommended to clean up or merge these entries to optimize performance.
- The customer was advised to monitor the next bulk import job closely and provide detailed logs if the issue recurred, including SQL Server Profiler trace files and active queries.

## Notes
- The customer should keep an eye on the performance of the bulk import jobs and report any significant deviations in run times.
- If the issue persists, further investigation into potential bugs in the StealthAUDIT application may be necessary.
- The case can be reopened within 30 days if related errors return.
