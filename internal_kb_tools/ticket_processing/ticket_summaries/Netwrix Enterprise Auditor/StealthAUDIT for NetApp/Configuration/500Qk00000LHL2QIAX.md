# Ticket Summary for Case #434179

## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LHL2QIAX
- **Case Number:** 434179
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Damus Aulu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Configuration
- **Feature:** Open Access Job
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Open Access job was not updating with results, specifically that it did not identify new shares that were openly exposed to the "Everyone" group.

## Environment Details
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.112

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a new open share.
2. Ran the Active Directory Inventory (ADI) and Permission scan, followed by a Bulk Import.
3. Executed the Open Access job.
4. Reviewed the report for new open shares.
5. Confirmed that the new share was not visible in the Open Share report.
6. Investigated the job configurations and logs.
7. Enabled debug logging for the FSAA Exceptions and Open Access jobs.
8. Collected and analyzed logs from the FSAA and Bulk Import jobs.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a misconfiguration between the collection jobs. There was also confusion due to data from decommissioned hosts affecting the results. The FSAA Exceptions job was not running correctly, which impacted the Open Access job's ability to report new shares.

## Solution
- The configuration was corrected, and the FSAA Exceptions job was re-run successfully.
- The Open Access job was then able to correctly identify and report the new shares.
- The customer was guided to ensure that the job logs were set to DEBUG for better visibility in future troubleshooting.

## Notes
- Ensure that all relevant jobs (FSAA scan, FSAA import, FSAA Exceptions, and Open Access) are correctly configured and scheduled to run in the proper order.
- Regularly check for updates from development regarding any known issues with job configurations.
- For future cases, verify that the logs are collected from the correct job folders and that the job settings are appropriately configured before escalating.
