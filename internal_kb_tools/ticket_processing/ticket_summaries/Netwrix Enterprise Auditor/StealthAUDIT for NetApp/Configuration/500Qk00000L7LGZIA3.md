## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L7LGZIA3
- **Case Number:** 433674
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)
- **Contact Name:** Justin Olson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after upgrading to version 11.6, they were unable to initiate FSAA or FSAC scans on their Bluebay NetApps, which are located on a different domain from their usual systems.

## Environment Details
- **Upgrade Version:** 11.6
- **Affected Domain:** Bluebay domain (different from usual systems)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Added the FG service account to local administrators on the proxy.
2. Configured the FG service account as a domain task account in the connection profile.
3. Attempted to kick off scans multiple times without success.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a requirement for manual certificates for proxies operating in a different domain, which was not addressed during the initial configuration.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by manually installing the necessary certificates for the proxies in the Bluebay domain. This allowed the scans to be successfully initiated.

## Notes
- Ensure that all necessary certificates are in place when configuring proxies across different domains to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to document the certificate requirements for various domain configurations to streamline future setups.
