- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

- **Feature:** Database

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the `SA_Messages` table's `MSGID` column type was set to `int`, which was causing FSAA/SEEK imports to fail. This issue resulted in excessive warnings and errors during scans across over 70 proxies and 100+ file servers, preventing the import jobs from completing successfully.

## Environment Details
- The customer environment includes over 70 proxies and more than 100 file servers.
- Each host/share was reporting over 1,000 warnings and errors during scans.
- SEEK scans were attempting to parse files up to 50 MB in size.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error messages related to the `SA_Messages` table and the `MSGID` column.
2. Attempted to replicate the issue in a lab environment but was unable to do so.
3. Engaged with the development team to investigate the database configuration and constraints.
4. Escalated the issue for further investigation and resolution.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the `MSGID` column in the `SA_Messages` table being set to `int`, which was insufficient for the volume of data being processed. The product does not automatically change the type of an existing column, and if the customer had previously changed the `MSGID` column type to `BIGINT`, it would not revert back to `int` without a manual intervention.

## Solution
The development team made the necessary changes to ensure that the `MSGID` column in the `SA_Messages` table would be created as `BIGINT` in future updates. This change was confirmed to be included in the next cumulative updates (CUs) for versions 11.6 and 12.0 of the product.

## Notes
- Customers experiencing similar issues should ensure that their database configurations align with the expected data types for the `SA_Messages` table.
- It is important to monitor the number of warnings and errors during scans, as excessive counts can indicate underlying issues that may affect import jobs.
- Future updates will address the column type issue, but customers should verify their configurations after applying updates to avoid regressions.
