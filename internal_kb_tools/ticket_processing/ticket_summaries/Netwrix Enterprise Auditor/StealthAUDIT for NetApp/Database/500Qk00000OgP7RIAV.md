## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OgP7RIAV
- **Case Number:** 443816
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** US Department of Treasury-Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
- **Contact Name:** Eugene Johnson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
After upgrading to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 12.0, the FS Create Schema job was executed as part of the standard post-upgrade procedure. The job hung indefinitely during the final analysis task, specifically at step 18: Data Migration > SQL script 1 of 3.

## Environment Details
- **Upgrade Version:** 12.0
- **Build Number:** 1070
- **Duration of Job Hang:** 72 hours before timing out
- **Database Management Tool Used:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the SQL query was running in SSMS but appeared to run indefinitely.
2. Checked logs in debug mode, which showed no updates until the job was aborted.
3. Client attempted to run the FSAA scan and bulk import jobs, which failed due to the Create Schema job not completing.
4. Client killed the Create Schema job after 15 hours due to scheduled FSAA scan jobs starting.
5. Investigated the new Coordination Service log introduced in version 12.0 for additional insights.

## Root Cause
The FS Create Schema job hung during the execution of a specific SQL script in the Data Migration phase. The exact cause of the hang was not identified, but it was determined that running the FS_MigrateSchema job prior to the Create Schema job was necessary for successful completion.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. The FS_MigrateSchema job was executed successfully.
2. After the completion of the FS_MigrateSchema job, the FS Create Schema job was run again, which completed successfully in approximately 8 hours without errors.

## Notes
- It is crucial to run the FS_MigrateSchema job before executing the FS Create Schema job after an upgrade to avoid indefinite hangs.
- Future cases involving similar hangs during the Create Schema job should consider the execution of the FS_MigrateSchema job as a preliminary step.
- Additional issues were noted post-upgrade, including UI latency and bulk import failures due to primary key constraints, which may require separate tickets for resolution.
