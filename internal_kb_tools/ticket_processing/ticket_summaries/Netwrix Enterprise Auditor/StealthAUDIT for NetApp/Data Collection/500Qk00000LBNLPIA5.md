## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LBNLPIA5
- **Case Number:** 433896
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ConocoPhillips Company
- **Contact Name:** Frank McNickle
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that one of their FSAA scans failed and appeared to be still running. Additionally, a bulk import process was ongoing, which could potentially interfere with the scan. The customer requested assistance to ensure the job had ended and to delete the tier2 databases if necessary to allow the next scan to run.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a call with the customer to discuss the issue.
2. Analyzed the bulk import process and identified that the "update stats" analysis task was failing.
3. Disabled the "update stats" analysis task to prevent it from interfering with the bulk import.
4. Advised the customer to rerun the job with the analysis disabled and to provide feedback on the results.

## Root Cause
The failure of the "update stats" analysis task during the bulk import process caused the FSAA scan to hang, leading to the perception that it was still running.

## Solution
Disabling the "update stats" analysis task on the bulk import allowed the scans to complete successfully. The customer was instructed to rerun the job without this analysis task, which resolved the issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that any analysis tasks that may conflict with ongoing processes are reviewed and disabled if necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to monitor the status of scans and imports closely to identify any potential conflicts early on.
