- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with FSAA (File System Access Auditing) scans on two NAS devices (NetApp Filers) located on the Phoenix and India servers. They were experiencing errors and wanted to ensure that the information in one of their tables was updating accurately.

## Environment Details
- **Servers:** Phoenix and India
- **Devices:** NAS devices (NetApp Filers)
- **Proxy Servers:** Each NAS device has its own proxy server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **India Server:**
   - Error encountered: "Failed to connect to INF-FS02.IN.AEXP.COMIPC$: This user isn't allowed to sign in to this computer."
   - Confirmed that the account is a Local Admin.
   - Investigated if "Logon as a Service" permission was granted to the service account.

2. **Phoenix Server:**
   - Logs indicated an inability to communicate between the Proxy and FS.
   - Confirmed that port 445 was open both ways between the Proxy and Filer.
   - Verified access to the share name from the proxy server.

3. **Communication with Client:**
   - Followed up with the client regarding permissions and account settings.
   - Provided documentation on account requirements to the NetApp team.

## Root Cause
The issues were primarily related to permission settings on the India server, specifically the lack of "Logon as a Service" permission for the service account. Additionally, there were communication issues between the proxy and the Phoenix server, which were not fully resolved during the troubleshooting process.

## Solution
The underlying issues of the different error messages were explained to the customer. The client communicated that the team originally concerned about the errors was no longer as worried. The ticket was subsequently closed with the understanding that if issues arose again, a new ticket could be opened.

## Notes
- Ensure that service accounts have the necessary permissions, including "Logon as a Service," especially when dealing with FSAA scans.
- Maintain clear communication with clients regarding the status of their issues and any changes in priority.
- Document any changes made to permissions or configurations for future reference.
