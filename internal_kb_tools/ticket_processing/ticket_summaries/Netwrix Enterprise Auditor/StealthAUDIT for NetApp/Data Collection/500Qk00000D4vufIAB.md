## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D4vufIAB
- **Case Number:** 414964
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WellSpan Health
- **Contact Name:** John Masgalas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that their SQL Database server was running out of disk space every few months. They sought guidance on how to verify that old data was being purged and that they were not retaining unnecessary data.

## Environment Details
- **Database Size:** 7TB
- **Retention Policy:** Set to keep 90 days of detailed activity.
- **SQL Version:** 11.5.1345.1044

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide the version and build of the software they were using.
2. A SQL query was executed to confirm the data retention settings:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM [StealthAudit].[dbo].[SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView]
   ```
3. The support team investigated the SEEK scans that were not completing, while other jobs (FSAA and FACS) were functioning correctly.
4. The case was escalated to the R&D team for further investigation due to the complexity of the issue.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a product defect related to the handling of FS jobs not ending cleanly, which prevented the TempDB from being cleaned up properly. This led to the accumulation of data and subsequent disk space issues.

## Solution
The issue was resolved after the implementation of an upgrade and bulk import workarounds from other scan cases. Post-implementation, the data shown in the Activity View was limited to the last 90 days, aligning with the customer's retention policy.

## Notes
- It is important for future reference to monitor the completion of FS jobs to ensure that they are ending cleanly, as this directly impacts disk space management.
- Customers should be advised to regularly check their data retention settings and the actual data being stored to prevent similar issues from arising.
- Continuous communication with the R&D team is crucial for resolving complex issues that may involve product defects.
