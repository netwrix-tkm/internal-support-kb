- **Case Number:** 436351
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hawaii Pacific Health
- **Contact Name:** Steven Schiesl
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the permission scan for the ERNIE2 database, which returned the error message: “Detected Tier 2 databases on remote applet server are newer than local databases. Retrieving databases and skipping scan.” This issue persisted during scheduled scans but did not occur when manually initiated.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.6.
- The scans were performed on the ERNIE2 database, with a proxy host identified as DRFSTEALTHSCN02.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the last manual scan completed successfully (11+ hours).
2. Investigated the creation of an empty ERNIE2 folder at 1:45 AM, which could not be traced to a specific job.
3. Verified that the proxy was correctly listed in the group scans.
4. Temporarily set the scheduled task to run as the domain service account.
5. Renamed the Tier 2 databases on the proxy to check for new folder creation.
6. Archived the Tier 2 databases on the proxy to push back over the local databases from the NEA server.
7. Conducted follow-up meetings to discuss the issue and potential solutions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a PowerShell script that was still running and copying empty folders to the console server before the scan started. This script was not disabled after previous troubleshooting efforts, leading to the corruption of the Tier 2 databases.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by disabling the problematic PowerShell script that was copying empty folders. After this change, the settings for the permission scan were reverted to their original configuration, and the scan ran successfully without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that any scripts or automated processes that interact with the database are reviewed and disabled if they are no longer needed, especially during troubleshooting.
- Future scans should be monitored closely to confirm that no residual processes are interfering with the expected outcomes.
- The ticket can be reopened within 30 days if any related issues arise.
