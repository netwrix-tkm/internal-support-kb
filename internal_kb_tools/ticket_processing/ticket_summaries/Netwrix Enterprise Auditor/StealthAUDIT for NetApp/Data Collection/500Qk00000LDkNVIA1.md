## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LDkNVIA1
- **Case Number:** 434002
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Express
- **Contact Name:** Alex Parsa
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether Netwrix Stealth Enterprise supports NetApp ONTAP version 9.15.1x.

## Environment Details
- The last fully tested version of NetApp ONTAP with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) is 9.7.
- Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) supports ONTAP 9.15.x with recommendations for specific versions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the NEA and NAM Guides, which indicate support for NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode 8.2 and above.
2. Confirmed that the last fully tested version for NEA is ONTAP 9.7, with no known issues in subsequent versions.
3. Noted that while SAM 6.0 supports ONTAP 9.15.x, an upgrade to NAM 8.0 is recommended for optimal performance due to the new Persistent Store feature.
4. Awaited confirmation from the SWAT team regarding official support for ONTAP 9.15.1x.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a lack of official testing and documentation for ONTAP versions beyond 9.7 in the NEA, while NAM had partial support for ONTAP 9.15.x.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying that:
- NEA does not officially support ONTAP 9.15.1x until further testing is completed.
- NAM 8.0 is recommended for users needing support for the Persistent Store feature introduced in ONTAP 9.15.x.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that while SAM 6.0 supports ONTAP 9.15.x, upgrading to NAM 8.0 is advisable to leverage new features and reduce latency issues.
- Official support for newer ONTAP versions will be documented only after thorough testing by the R&D team.
