## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FG3FpIAL
- **Case Number:** 419839
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Howard County, MD
- **Contact Name:** Frank Salah
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether it was possible to track changes to permissions on a file share and identify who made those changes using StealthAudit. They observed that the web UI indicated permissions had changed but did not provide details on when or who made those changes.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA):** 11.5.0.245
- **Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC):** 11.5.0.130
- **Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM):** 6.0.124
- **Retention settings:** Configured to clear data post 60 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the versions of the Netwrix applications running in the environment.
2. Reviewed the Resource Audit Overview in the Netwrix Access Information Center.
3. Checked the Permissions Report for explicit permissions granted to the selected resource.
4. Investigated the Activity Events table and NAM for potential activity data.
5. Noted that the Owner of the folder was the Manager of the Group with access.

## Root Cause
The changes to permissions were likely made within Active Directory (AD) to one of the groups that had access to the folder. The only recorded permissions changes via the File Server Scan (FSAC) were from an old NetApp host back in April, which fell outside the current retention settings.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the current version of the Netwrix applications was up to date and by directing the customer to the appropriate reports in the Netwrix Access Information Center. Specifically, the Permissions Report was highlighted, which provides a comparison of permissions against parent permissions for the selected trustee.

## Notes
- The retention settings in NAM and NEA are set to clear data after 60 days, which may limit the ability to track older changes.
- For future reference, it is advisable to regularly check the Activity Events table and NAM for activity data, especially if retention settings are a concern.
- The customer should be aware that changes made in AD may not be directly visible in the StealthAudit reports if they fall outside the retention period.
