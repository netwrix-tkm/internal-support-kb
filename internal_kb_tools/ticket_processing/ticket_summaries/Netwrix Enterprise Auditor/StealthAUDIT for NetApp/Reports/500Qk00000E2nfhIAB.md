- **Case Number:** 417127
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Sean Steinberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported unexpected exceptions occurring during the generation of reports in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically related to file system activity. The errors included issues with publishing reports and missing file paths.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for NetApp
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error messages generated during report publishing:
   - **FS_PermissionChanges:** "Unexpected exception: Error while publishing report. Exiting with message: Sequence contains more than one matching element."
   - **FS_LeastPrivilegedAccess:** "Unexpected exception: Encountered error: 'Could not find a part of the path 'Overprovisioning Risk by Share_{768990C4-31E5-46E5-A739-F4C10E5FFC86}.pdf'." while generating report.
2. Attempted to identify the root cause of the errors but found it to be unknown.
3. Accessed the Reports.xml file to investigate the structure and content related to the erroring reports.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, the errors indicated potential conflicts or missing elements in the report generation process, particularly with multiple matching elements and missing file paths.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Opened the Reports.xml file from before the errors occurred.
2. Navigated to the section corresponding to the reports that were generating errors.
3. Deleted all content between the `<Reports></Reports>` tags under the relevant job.
4. Reran the job, which successfully generated the reports without errors.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the Reports.xml file is properly structured and does not contain conflicting elements that could lead to exceptions during report generation.
- Future users should be cautious when modifying XML files and ensure backups are taken before making changes.
- Monitoring for similar error messages can help in preemptively addressing potential issues with report generation.
