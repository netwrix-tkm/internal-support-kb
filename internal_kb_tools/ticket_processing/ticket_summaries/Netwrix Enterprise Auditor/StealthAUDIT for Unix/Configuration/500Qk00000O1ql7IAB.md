## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O1ql7IAB
- **Case Number:** 441896
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Micron Technology, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Rajesh Durganath
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Collector Code: StealthAUDIT for Unix
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6.0.92

## Problem Description
The customer needed assistance in testing and integrating a Unix system (specifically a RedHat Linux server) into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** RedHat Linux 7.9
- **Port:** 22 (SSH) open for connectivity

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Provided the customer with documentation on required permissions and configurations for the Unix data collector.
2. Inquired about the status of the Unix module and the specific software features the customer intended to use.
3. Scheduled a remote session to assist with the setup.
4. Identified that the server was displaying 'Access Denied' errors due to incorrect account permissions.
5. Advised the customer on implementing the Least Privilege Model for account permissions.
6. Followed up on the implementation of the necessary permissions and configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect account permissions on the Unix server, which resulted in 'Access Denied' errors when attempting to scan.

## Solution
The customer was instructed to set up the account with the necessary permissions, including SUDO access, as per the guidelines provided in the documentation. After the permissions were correctly configured, the customer confirmed that the required ports were open, allowing successful scanning of the Unix system.

## Notes
- Ensure that all requirements for the Least Privilege Model are strictly followed, as they are mandatory and cannot be skipped.
- Future cases should verify that the customer has the correct permissions set up before proceeding with scanning or integration tasks.
