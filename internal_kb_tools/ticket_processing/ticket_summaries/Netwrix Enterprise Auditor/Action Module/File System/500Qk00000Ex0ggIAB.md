## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ex0ggIAB
- **Case Number:** 419141
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** National Board of Medical Examiners
- **Contact Name:** Bob Langer
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Action Module
- **Feature:** File System
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported two medium vulnerabilities in Netwrix products that required remediation. The first issue involved incorrect permissions on a specific executable file, while the second issue related to an outdated version of .NET Core and ASP.NET affecting the functionality of Threat Manager and Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Path:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Stealthbits\StealthAudit\FileSystemAM\stealthauditrpcfsam.exe`
- **Current .NET Core Version:** 6.0.19
- **Server:** phprdappstb01w.nbme.org

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed permissions on the executable file located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Stealthbits\StealthAudit\FileSystemAM\stealthauditrpcfsam.exe`.
2. Confirmed that "Users" had modify permissions, which should not be the case.
3. Discussed the implications of removing these permissions with the customer.
4. Attempted to update .NET Core and ASP.NET to the latest supported version (8) but encountered issues causing Enterprise Auditor to stop working.
5. Rolled back the changes after confirming the inoperability of the Stealth Bit site post-update.

## Root Cause
The incorrect permissions on the executable file were likely set during troubleshooting or installation processes, allowing non-admin users to modify files in a protected directory. The issue with the .NET Core and ASP.NET update was due to compatibility problems with the current version of Threat Manager and Enterprise Auditor.

## Solution
- Removed "Users" from having modify permissions on the executable file located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Stealthbits\StealthAudit\FileSystemAM\stealthauditrpcfsam.exe`, thereby securing the file against unauthorized modifications.
- The vendor confirmed that a fix for the compatibility issue with .NET Core and ASP.NET would be included in the next release of Stealth Defend, scheduled for Q3.

## Notes
- It is recommended to regularly review permissions on sensitive executable files to prevent unauthorized access.
- Customers should be informed about the compatibility of future updates with existing products, especially when dealing with critical components like .NET Core and ASP.NET.
- Keep track of vendor release schedules for timely updates and fixes to avoid operational disruptions.
