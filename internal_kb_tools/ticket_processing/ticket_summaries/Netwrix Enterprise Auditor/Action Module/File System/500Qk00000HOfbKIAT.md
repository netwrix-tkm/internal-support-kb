## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving the error message "Server execution failed" on multiple jobs when attempting to create a new Excel application object using PowerShell. The specific error indicated a failure in retrieving the COM class factory for the Excel application.

## Environment Details

  ```
  New-Object : Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} failed due to the following error: 80080005 Server execution failed (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80080005 (CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE)).
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the installation of Microsoft Excel on the server.
2. Attempted to run the PowerShell command to create the Excel application object.
3. Checked for any permissions issues related to COM objects.
4. Uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Excel to resolve potential corruption.
5. Tested the PowerShell command again after reinstallation.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure in the COM object instantiation for Excel, which was likely caused by a corrupted installation of Microsoft Excel or improper permissions for the COM components.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by uninstalling and then reinstalling Microsoft Excel. This action restored the necessary COM components and allowed the PowerShell command to execute successfully without errors.

## Notes
- If the customer is considering running the application without Excel installed, ensure that any dependencies on Excel COM objects are addressed, as this may lead to similar issues.
- It is advisable to check for proper permissions and configurations for COM objects in future cases involving similar errors.
