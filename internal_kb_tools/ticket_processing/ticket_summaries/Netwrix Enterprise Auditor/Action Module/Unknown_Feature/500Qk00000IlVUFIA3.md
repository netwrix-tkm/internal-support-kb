## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IlVUFIA3
- **Case Number:** 428042
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eisai, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Ian Andersen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Action Module
- **Feature:** File System Copy Action
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the File System Copy Action where files were being created in a temporary folder (`fsam.tmp`) but were not being transferred to the intended destination. Instead, the files were written and deleted every 1-2 minutes without any files reaching the destination.

## Environment Details
- **Time Zone:** USA TZ
- **Product Version:** 11.6.0.72

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the issue occurred regardless of the options set for overwrite, terminate, retry, and batching.
2. Reviewed the process flow to ensure understanding of the temporary file creation and deletion.
3. Attempted to replicate the issue in a controlled environment.
4. Escalated the issue to the development team for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as the input paths not being specified correctly. The source and destination paths needed to be full UNC paths, and the source table must include the folder structure or it must be reconstructed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the input for both the source and destination included full UNC paths. This adjustment allowed the files to be copied correctly from the source to the destination. It was noted that while this solution worked for all files in the source, it did not copy the folder structure.

## Notes
- For future reference, ensure that the source table includes the folder structure or that the structure is reconstructed to avoid similar issues.
- It is important to specify full UNC paths for both source and destination to prevent errors related to file creation and copying.
