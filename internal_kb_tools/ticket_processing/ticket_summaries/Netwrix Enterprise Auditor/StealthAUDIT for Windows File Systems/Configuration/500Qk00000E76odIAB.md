- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank
- **Contact Name:** Jennifer White
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in purging old server data for decommissioned servers (Atlas, Fipr01, Odysseus, Rew, Wizcard) and updating the file systems scanned to include new servers (Atlas, Kas, Jwiz) in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) database.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Build Number:** 84
- **Age:** 15.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a new job in a sandbox or custom folder named "DropFSHosts".
2. Added a new query using the FILESYSTEMACCESS data collector.
3. In the query settings, selected the "Remove Host Data" option and completed the setup.
4. Navigated to configure > hosts under the job.
5. Entered the individual hosts to be removed from the database and saved the changes.
6. Right-clicked the job and selected the "Performance" tab.
7. Unchecked the box labelled "Skip Hosts that do not respond to PING".
8. Ran the job to drop the file system data for the specified hosts.
9. Removed the decommissioned hosts from the global host management list to prevent future scans.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the presence of outdated and decommissioned file servers in the NEA database, which needed to be purged to maintain accurate data and prevent unnecessary scans.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating a job specifically designed to remove the decommissioned file servers and their associated data from the NEA database. This involved configuring a query to remove host data and ensuring that the decommissioned hosts were excluded from future scans.

## Notes
- Ensure that any decommissioned hosts are removed from the global host management list to avoid attempts to scan them in the future.
- It is advisable to perform such purges in a sandbox environment first to verify the process before applying it to the production environment.
