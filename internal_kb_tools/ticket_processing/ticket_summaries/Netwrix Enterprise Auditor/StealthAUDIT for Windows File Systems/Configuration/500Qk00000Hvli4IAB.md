## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hvli4IAB
- **Case Number:** 426137
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MUFG Bank, LTD.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Kong
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** File System Action Module (FSAM)
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the "Retry failed rows" option in the File System Action Module (FSAM) of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. They wanted to know how to specify certain error codes so that the system would skip rows instead of retrying them when an error occurs, particularly when the path is not reachable.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the FSAM options in the Netwrix Help Center documentation.
2. Provided links to Microsoft documentation on system error codes.
3. Engaged in email communication with the customer to clarify their requirements.
4. Suggested a meeting to discuss the issue further.
5. Confirmed the specific error code (0x80004005) and its corresponding value (4005) for the "do not retry" setting.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's need to configure the FSAM to recognize specific error codes and skip processing for those rows instead of retrying them. The default behavior was to log a generic "RPC error" without providing specific error code handling.

## Solution
The resolution involved guiding the customer to input the correct error code (4005) into the FSAM configuration under the "do not retry error codes" setting. This allowed the system to skip rows associated with the specified error code, thus meeting the customer's requirements.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the specific error codes they need to configure in the FSAM settings.
- Recommend reviewing the Netwrix Help Center and Microsoft documentation for detailed information on error codes and FSAM configuration options.
- Future inquiries regarding error handling in FSAM should reference the specific error codes and their meanings to streamline troubleshooting.
