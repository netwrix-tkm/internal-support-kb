## Problem Description
The customer reported that access was denied when attempting to scan a new Windows file server as part of their FSAA collection setup, which included five new servers.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on a new Windows file server named DEACMICS-APP01.
- The customer was using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the permissions required for scanning as per the documentation provided by Netwrix.
2. Confirmed that the new host was missing the necessary permissions.
3. Discussed the possibility of using a backup operator account instead of a local admin account for scanning.
4. Advised the customer to ensure that the global account access was set up correctly for the target host.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the access denied error was identified as the new host missing the required permissions necessary for the FSAA scan, as outlined in the Netwrix documentation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the global account access was properly configured for the DEACMICS-APP01 target host. The customer was directed to follow the permissions setup as detailed in the Netwrix documentation: [StealthAUDIT 11.5 Permissions Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/Configuration/Windows_Config/SA_FS_Scan_(Windows).htm).

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all required permissions are configured correctly on new hosts before attempting to scan.
- Future users should consider using a backup operator account for scanning instead of local accounts, as this can help avoid similar access issues.
- Always refer to the latest documentation for permission requirements when setting up new servers for scanning.
