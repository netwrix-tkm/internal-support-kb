## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E107cIAB
- **Case Number:** 417053
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Connie Liang
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5.0.260

## Problem Description
The customer inadvertently added an instant job in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and needed assistance in removing it. They attempted to manually remove the jobs but encountered difficulties due to the jobs being interspersed.

## Environment Details
- **Application Version:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT) 11.5.0.260
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current version of the Stealth application running in the environment.
2. Identified and removed the duplicate job group located at:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\Jobs\GROUP_FileSystem\GROUP_0.Collection\GROUP_1.Permissions\GROUP_FileSystem
   ```
3. Compared the current jobs with those from a backup located at:
   ```
   C:\RestoreJobs\GROUP_FileSystem
   ```
4. Renamed the File System Activity (FSAC) related jobs in the console to prefix them with "BU_" (backup) to prevent removal of collected data from the SQL database.
5. Noted other configuration oddities that may require a health check by sales to ensure proper data collection.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect configuration and the inadvertent addition of instant jobs within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, leading to job interspersing and duplication.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the duplicate job group and renaming the FSAC related jobs to preserve collected data.
- Ensuring that the configuration was corrected to prevent future occurrences.

## Notes
- It is recommended to perform regular health checks on the configuration to ensure that the necessary data is being collected effectively.
- Future users should be cautious when adding instant jobs to avoid similar issues with job interspersing.
