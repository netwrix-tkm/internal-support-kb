- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Oak Hill Advisors
- **Contact Name:** Douglas Kupcha
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6.138

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with FileSystem Scan jobs, specifically the SEEK System and Bulk Import jobs, which were preventing other scan jobs from starting. This situation posed a risk of losing auditing data.

## Environment Details
- The issue began around February 15, 2025, with sporadic results.
- The current installed version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was 11.6.138.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Review**: Customer provided error logs indicating SQL logic errors related to missing tables in the database.
2. **Communication Check**: Confirmed no communication issues between the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor host and the file server using ping and WMI calls.
3. **Error Analysis**: Identified a corrupt database disk image and missing tables causing the errors.
4. **Job Configuration Review**: Noted that Sensitive Data Discovery was not licensed, leading to disabled jobs.
5. **Performance Adjustment**: Adjusted the SEEK scan performance settings from 10 to 4.
6. **Version Upgrade**: Recommended and performed an upgrade of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 11.6.138.
7. **Job Recovery**: Recovered customized SQL jobs from an upgraded archive to correct missing scheduled tasks.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a corrupt database and missing tables in the SQLite database used by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Additionally, the SEEK jobs were misconfigured and not properly licensed, which contributed to the failures.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Disabling all SEEK jobs, which allowed other file system jobs to run successfully and error-free.
- Upgrading the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to the latest version (11.6.138) to ensure all enhancements and fixes were applied.
- Recovering necessary SQL jobs from an archive to restore functionality.

## Notes
- After disabling the SEEK jobs, all other file system jobs completed successfully within an acceptable timeframe (approximately 9 hours).
- It is important to ensure that all components are properly licensed and configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- The customer was advised to monitor the system for any recurring issues and to reach out if further assistance is needed.
