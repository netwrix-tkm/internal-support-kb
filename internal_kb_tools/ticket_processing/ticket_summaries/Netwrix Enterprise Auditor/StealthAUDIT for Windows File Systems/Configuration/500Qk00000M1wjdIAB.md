## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M1wjdIAB
- **Case Number:** 436194
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** John Deere Company
- **Contact Name:** Scott Prigge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the FSAA applet logging was not matching the Console settings, specifically noting that the Console settings indicated a warning while the applet log was collecting at the DEBUG level.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 70
- **Default Log Path:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAANLog.config`

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the console settings and applet log levels.
2. Confirmed that the applet server logs default to DEBUG.
3. Identified that the log level for the FSAA_Applet_Server log is controlled by the `NLog.config` file.
4. Located the `NLog.config` file on the NEA server and the applet host.
5. Suggested adjusting the log level settings in the `NLog.config` file to mitigate disk usage.

## Root Cause
The applet server logs default to DEBUG level, which can lead to larger log sizes than expected. This was not aligned with the Console settings that indicated a warning.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the log level for the FSAA_Applet_Server was adjusted from DEBUG to a lower level to reduce disk usage. The following changes were recommended in the `NLog.config` file:

```xml
<rules>
    <logger name="*FSAA*" minlevel="Debug" writeTo="ServerFile" />
    <logger name="*Kestrel*" minlevel="Info" writeTo="ServerFile" />
    <logger name="*HttpsConnectionMiddleware*" minlevel="Debug" writeTo="ServerFile" />
    <logger name="*" minlevel="Warn" writeTo="ServerFile" />
</rules>
```

- Recommended log levels: Error, Debug, Info, Warn.
- Suggested not to set the log level lower than Error.
- Advised using Notepad++ or a similar simple code editor for making changes.

## Notes
- Ensure that changes to the `NLog.config` file are made carefully to avoid misconfiguration.
- This logging configuration is separate from the settings for the Scans in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
