- **Case Number:** 436511
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eisai, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Paul Pitas
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported errors during the FS SEEK Bulk Import process, specifically a violation of the primary key constraint `PK_SA_FSDLP_Matches`, indicating a duplicate key issue in the `dbo.SA_FSDLP_Matches` object.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The customer was utilizing the StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the FSSEEK System Scan.
2. Attempted the FSSEEK Bulk Import, which resulted in the reported error.
3. Investigated the applet logs to identify the cause of the issue.
4. Attempted a repair, which did not resolve the issue.
5. Dropped the DLPEX t2 from the FSAA folder and reran the scan without differential scanning.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was noted that the DLPEX database contained folder and file ID combinations that did not exist in the resources table, leading to the primary key constraint violation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by dropping the DLPEX t2 from the FSAA folder and rerunning the next scan without using differential scanning. This approach corrected the problem, and subsequent scans did not exhibit the same issue.

## Notes
- It is important to note that dropping the data and performing a non-differential scan is not a long-term solution, as these scans can take weeks to complete.
- Future occurrences of similar issues should be monitored closely, and if they arise again, further investigation into the logs of paused scans may be necessary to identify any discrepancies in the resources table.
