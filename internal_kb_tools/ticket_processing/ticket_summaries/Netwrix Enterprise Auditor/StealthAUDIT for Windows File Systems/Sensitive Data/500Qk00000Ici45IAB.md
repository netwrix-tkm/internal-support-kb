- **Case Number:** 427819
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PrimeSource Building Products, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Jeff Forsyth
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The SEEK System Scan was not returning results against a Windows Filer, despite the collection functioning correctly against the localhost.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred while using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.
- The scans were attempted in both local and automatic modes without success.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Set the scan server selection to either Local or Automatic (remote for Windows).
2. Run SEEK scan and import jobs.
3. Verified that the collection was functional against the localhost.
4. Collected logs and artifacts from the customer for analysis.
5. Investigated for any endpoint security software that might interfere with the scanning process.
6. Checked for resource spikes during the scan execution.

## Root Cause
The scans were abruptly terminating, which was identified as a potential issue related to resource consumption growing unexpectedly. This was linked to a known defect in the Sensitive Data add-on that could lead to out-of-memory errors and crashes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.0.138 or higher, which included a fix for the resource consumption issue that caused the scans to fail.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are using the latest builds of both Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Sensitive Data add-on to avoid similar issues.
- If scans continue to fail after the upgrade, further investigation into the execution host and any potential endpoint security conflicts may be necessary.
