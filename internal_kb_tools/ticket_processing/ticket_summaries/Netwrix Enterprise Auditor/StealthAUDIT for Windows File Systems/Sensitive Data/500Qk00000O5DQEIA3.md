## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O5DQEIA3
- **Case Number:** 442164
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hawaii Pacific Health
- **Contact Name:** Steven Schiesl
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported that some scan jobs were consistently logging messages as ERROR, even though these messages were known and not technically errors. The customer requested a way to stop logging specific errors into the SA_Message table or to categorize these errors as warnings to simplify the scan results.

## Environment Details
- The issue was occurring during sensitive data scans using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 12.0.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to understand the specific errors being logged.
2. Suggested the possibility of excluding specific directories from the scans.
3. Provided documentation on scoping options for filtering out known errors.
4. Guided the customer through the process of configuring exclusions in the Data Collector wizard.

## Root Cause
The errors were being generated by scan jobs attempting to access file system objects that were expected to produce errors. These objects were either deleted or non-existent, leading to unnecessary error logging.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adding exclusions for the expected error-generating objects using the scoping options in the Data Collector wizard. The customer was provided with detailed steps on how to configure these exclusions, which effectively filtered out the known errors from the scan results.

## Notes
- The customer confirmed that the solution worked as intended, but noted that some folders that were deleted were still appearing in the Netwrix database. They plan to investigate further to ensure these folders are properly removed.
- It is recommended to regularly review and update exclusions as the file system changes to prevent similar issues in the future.
