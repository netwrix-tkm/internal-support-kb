## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000D9R9aIAF
- **Case Number:** 415166
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Edelman Financial Engines
- **Contact Name:** Jim Manalo
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that sensitive data scans on DC1 were taking an unusually long time to complete, running for 6 days instead of the previous duration of approximately 3 hours.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Scan Type:** Sensitive Data

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Inquired if any additional servers were added to the scan.
2. Suggested enabling debug logging for the scan job to collect detailed logs.
3. Conducted a remote session to analyze the configuration and performance.
4. Adjusted the number of probable owners scanned from unlimited to 4.
5. Increased the number of threads for the SEEK scan from 3 to 6.
6. Verified that the FSAA and SEEK scans were not conflicting.
7. Excluded a folder from the scans that was no longer needed.
8. Increased `MAXTHREADS` from 8 to 12 and `MAXFOLDERTHREADS` from 4 to 8 in the SEEK job XML.

## Root Cause
The prolonged scan times were attributed to insufficient threading and potential conflicts between the FSAA and SEEK scans, as well as the inclusion of unnecessary folders in the scan scope.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the settings in the SEEK job XML:
- Increased `MAXTHREADS` from 8 to 12.
- Increased `MAXFOLDERTHREADS` from 4 to 8.
These changes allowed the scans to run more efficiently, significantly reducing the scan time.

## Notes
- Ensure that debug logging is enabled for future scans to facilitate troubleshooting.
- Monitor the performance of scans after making configuration changes to identify any further optimizations.
- Consider splitting scans by host rather than by DC if performance issues persist in the future.
