## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CK9bPIAT
- **Case Number:** 413112
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited
- **Contact Name:** James Allen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether it was possible to apply tags to files identified by a sensitive data scan without altering the file's date and timestamp, while also ensuring that only files in a specific folder were affected.

## Environment Details
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Build Number:** 231

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support engineer confirmed the customer's request and initiated an investigation.
2. A PowerShell script was requested to gather information about the installed versions of relevant software on the customer's systems.
3. The customer provided the output of the PowerShell script, detailing the installed versions of StealthAUDIT and related components.
4. The development team was consulted regarding the implications of tagging files and its effect on timestamps.

## Root Cause
It was determined that modifying file attributes, such as applying tags, inherently changes the access and modification timestamps of the files. This behavior is by design to prevent potential data corruption and issues with applications that rely on these timestamps.

## Solution
The support team communicated to the customer that it is not possible to apply tags to files without changing their timestamps. This limitation is a built-in feature of the system to ensure data integrity. The customer was informed that any modification to a file system object, including tagging, will result in timestamp changes.

## Notes
- It is important for users to understand that any modification to file attributes will affect timestamps, which may impact processes that rely on these attributes, such as stale file jobs.
- Future inquiries regarding file tagging should include this limitation to set appropriate expectations for customers.
