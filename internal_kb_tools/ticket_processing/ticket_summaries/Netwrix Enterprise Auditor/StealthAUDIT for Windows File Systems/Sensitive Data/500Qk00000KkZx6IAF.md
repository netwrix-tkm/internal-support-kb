- **Case Number:** 432623
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Ardentec
- **Contact Name:** Support Sphinxtec
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.6.0.130

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the "filepath" field in the "Share with Sensitive Content" section was displaying no data after running a sensitive data discovery job.

## Environment Details
- The customer upgraded to version 11.6.0.130 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The issue was reproducible in a lab environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer ran the SEEK job for sensitive data collection.
2. Verified results in the FileSystem Solution -> 0.Collection -> 0-Collection -> FSDLP_Matchesview.
3. Attempted to view reports in the 7.Sensitive Data section, where the filepath was still empty.
4. Identified that the issue was related to a known bug affecting files with exceptions (e.g., password-protected files).
5. Confirmed that the bug was resolved in versions 11.6.127 and 11.6.132.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was a known bug in the software that prevented the filepath from being displayed for certain files, particularly those with exceptions such as being password protected.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Ran the SEEK job specifically for the affected host.
2. Navigated to the directory on the NEA server: `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAASERVER_NAME` (where SERVER_NAME refers to the affected host).
3. Rearranged files by timestamp and copied the latest timestamped files.
4. Deleted the copied files.
5. Created an instant job with the Library Name: File System -> FS_SDD_DELETE.
6. In the FS_SDD_DELETE job, checked the box for "Delete Host" and configured the analysis settings.
7. Executed the job.
8. Reset the host in the SEEK Job under Queries -> Query Properties -> Maintenance.
9. Ran the SEEK scan, SEEK Bulk import scan, and Sensitive data scan again.

## Notes
- Ensure that the software is updated to the latest version to avoid known bugs.
- Monitor for any exceptions in files that may affect data visibility in reports.
- Document any similar issues and resolutions for future reference to streamline troubleshooting processes.
