## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E40HXIAZ
- **Case Number:** 417179
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited
- **Contact Name:** James Allen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Sensitive Data
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
After upgrading to version 11.6, the customer's Sensitive Data job failed to run. The initial error indicated that the Tier 1 database schema was not up to date, prompting the user to run the Create Schema job. Following this, a new error emerged related to an outdated assembly reference.

## Environment Details
- **Upgrade Version:** 11.6
- **Affected Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Initial Error Message:** 
  ```
  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the Create Schema job
  ```
- **Subsequent Error Message:**
  ```
  Error during processing: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Ran the Create Schema job as instructed by the initial error message.
2. Encountered a new error related to the `System.Data.SQLite` assembly.
3. Investigated the version of the `System.Data.SQLite.dll` library in the installation directory.
4. Identified that the version was outdated (1.0.112.0) after the upgrade.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an outdated version of the `System.Data.SQLite.dll` library (1.0.112.0) remaining in the installation directory after the upgrade to version 11.6. This outdated library was incompatible with the new version, leading to the failure of the Sensitive Data job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by replacing the outdated `System.Data.SQLite.dll` (version 1.0.112.0) located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAA` with the correct version (1.0.117.0) sourced from another folder within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor installation. After this replacement, the Sensitive Data job was able to run successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that all dependent libraries are updated during upgrades to prevent similar issues.
- Regularly check for compatibility of assemblies after software upgrades to avoid runtime errors.
- Document any changes made to the installation directory for future reference.
