## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Fr9EDIAZ
- **Case Number:** 421206
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Thales Group Australia
- **Contact Name:** Matthew Heaton-Harris
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that FSAC scan jobs for Windows fileservers were encountering an "Unknown protocol VSS" warning during execution.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the scan job configurations to ensure they were set up correctly.
2. Checked the logs for any additional error messages or warnings related to the VSS protocol.
3. Consulted documentation regarding VSS monitoring and its implications on scan jobs.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue in a test environment to understand the behavior better.

## Root Cause
The "Unknown protocol VSS" warning was identified as a non-critical warning related to the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) monitoring feature. It does not indicate a failure of the scan job but rather an informational message that can be safely ignored or managed.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that they could either:
- Ignore the "Unknown protocol VSS" warnings, as they do not affect the functionality of the scan jobs.
- Disable VSS monitoring if they prefer not to see these warnings in the future.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that such warnings are informational and do not impact the overall performance of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- Customers should be made aware of the option to disable VSS monitoring if they find the warnings distracting.
