- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Eglin Federal Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Glenda Coley
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the File System Activity (FSA) data retention settings were not being respected. Although the detailed activity retention was set to the default of 60 days, the database was able to recall events dating back to March 2023. Additionally, incomplete activity data was displayed in the Access Information Center (AIC), which was suspected to be a symptom of the data retention issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor environment.
- The customer was planning to upgrade the operating system on their NEA server and considered deploying a fresh installation on a new server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the data retention settings in the File System Activity collection.
2. Checked the database for existing event records and confirmed they extended beyond the expected retention period.
3. Investigated the AIC to determine if the incomplete data was related to the size of the dataset.
4. Conducted meetings with the customer to discuss potential upgrades and parallel setups to isolate the issue.
5. Deployed a new server to run a fresh installation of the NEA and AIC to gather clean data.
6. Monitored the file system scans and retention settings over a period of 60 days.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a malfunctioning NEA database cleanup job, which was not properly removing stale data from the database. This led to the retention settings not being respected.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by moving to a new server and redeploying the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. This fresh installation helped to eliminate any corruption that may have existed in the old environment. After the new setup, the file system scans were monitored for 60 days to ensure that the data retention was functioning as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the retention settings after any server migration or upgrade to ensure that the cleanup jobs are functioning correctly.
- If similar issues arise, consider deploying a fresh installation to rule out corruption in the existing environment.
- Ensure that all relevant permissions and configurations are correctly set up in the new environment to avoid access issues.
