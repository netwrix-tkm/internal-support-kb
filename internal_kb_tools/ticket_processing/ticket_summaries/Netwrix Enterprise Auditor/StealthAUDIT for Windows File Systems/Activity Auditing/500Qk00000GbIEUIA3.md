- **Case Number:** 422886
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Excellus Health Plan, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Gary Bender
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that approximately 10 servers used for monthly file deletion reports were missing a subset of those servers from the relevant tables in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Issue Type:** Guidance

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified a potential pathing issue with the Netwrix Activity Monitor agents and the monitored host's output file path.
2. Verified that there were two output paths listed on the hosts, one for the NAM agent and one managed by SI.
3. Conducted an FSAC system scan in the NEA console to check for recent activity results.
4. Suggested checking the proxy for a suspend file that might be holding up data processing.
5. Recommended deleting specific files in the FSAA Tier 2 directory to refresh the data import process.
6. Confirmed that the SI agents were still monitoring recent activity by reviewing the recent events tab within the SI console.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a suspend file located on the proxy, which was preventing the import of older data into the database. Additionally, there were pathing issues with the monitored hosts that needed to be addressed.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
- Identifying and removing the suspend file on the proxy.
- Deleting the `servername_activity.fsaadb` and any `activity.fsaadb.old` files located in the FSAA Tier 2 directory.
- Successfully recovering the old data by following the knowledge base instructions provided by the support team.

## Notes
- Ensure that the monitored host names match the format seen in the NEA (FQDN or NetBios) to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for suspend files on proxies to prevent data import issues.
- Document any changes made to file paths and configurations for future reference.
