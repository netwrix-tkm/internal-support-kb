## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FoxR1IAJ
- **Case Number:** 421127
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Mizuho Americas Services LLC
- **Contact Name:** William Dang
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when attempting to scan a newly added agent in the File Activity Monitor. The error indicated that the scan session could not be initialized with any proxy host supplied, despite the new agent successfully collecting data from the filer.

## Environment Details
- **Agent Server:** SA1041V (Windows Server)
- **Previous Configuration:** The file server was audited by a different instance of NEA from a different domain.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the new agent and proxy server.
2. Checked the version of the FS scanning proxy and found it was outdated.
3. Uninstalled the old proxy and SDD applications.
4. Installed the newer version of the FS proxy and SDD.
5. Changed query settings to require the applet to run as a service on the target.
6. Created a scheduled job for the scan.
7. Encountered the error "there is no row at position zero" during the scan.
8. Investigated debug logs and identified potential trust issues with certificates.
9. Accessed the certificate management tool using `psexec` to delete bad certificates in the FSAA location for both service and system accounts.
10. Dropped old NEA host data from the SQL database using the dropdata instant job.
11. Renamed the T2 folder on the proxy and application server to SERVERNAME_OLD.
12. Ran the job again, which resolved the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the file server being previously audited by a different instance of NEA from another domain, which corrupted the T2s. Additionally, broken certificates contributed to the inability to establish a secure connection.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Fixing the certificates by deleting the corrupted ones using the certificate management tool.
- Dropping the old NEA host data from the SQL database and renaming the T2 folder to avoid conflicts with the new instance.
- Running the job again after these changes, which successfully resolved the scanning issue.

## Notes
- Ensure that any file servers previously audited by different NEA instances are properly cleaned up before adding them to a new instance to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly update the FS scanning proxy and SDD applications to the latest versions to prevent compatibility issues.
- Monitor the storage space on the application server, as insufficient space can lead to scanning errors.
