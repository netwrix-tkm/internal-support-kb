## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during the FSAC Bulk Import process, specifically stating: "Failed to import SA_FSAC_ProcessNames: SQL logic error no such table: TBL_FSAC_ProcessNames." The customer was seeking clarification on the cause of this error.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.0
- **Build Number:** 11.0.0.231
- **Age:** 17.9

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message indicating a SQL logic error related to a missing table.
2. Checked the FSAC Bulk Import process to confirm if any data was available for import.
3. Investigated the execution status of the FSAC Scan Job prior to the Bulk Import attempt.

## Root Cause
The FSAC Bulk Import failed because there was no data available to be imported. This was compounded by the fact that the FSAC Scan Job had not been executed prior to the Bulk Import, which is necessary to populate the required tables.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running the FSAC Scan Job before attempting the Bulk Import again. Once the scan job was completed, the import process succeeded without errors.

## Notes
- The customer expressed a desire for the ability to run jobs via API, which has been documented in Feature Request 43847581.
- Ensure that the FSAC Scan Job is always executed prior to the Bulk Import to avoid similar issues in the future.
