## Problem Description
The 1_FSAC_SystemScans job was failing for the FC02 file server and other file servers, displaying the error: 
```
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: GetSessions failed with code 0x80004005
```

## Environment Details
- Scanned host: Windows File server FC02
- Applet launch mechanism: MS Task Scheduler
- Scan server selection: Automatic

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message and its details.
2. Checked for the presence of the `StealthAUDITRPC.exe` process on both the FC02 server and the StealthAudit server using the command:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process -name Stealth*
   ```
   - Confirmed that the process was not running on either server.
3. Analyzed the permissions for the user account specified in the Connection Profile used by the 1_FSAC_SystemScans job.
4. Reviewed the File System access query settings for the job.
5. Suggested checking the Applet Mode Permissions and Port Requirements as per the provided documentation.
6. Recommended switching the "Scan Server selection" to "Local server" as a workaround.

## Root Cause
The issue was determined to be caused by a lack of permissions for the user account specified in the Connection Profile for the 1_FSAC_SystemScans job. This was confirmed by the absence of the `StealthAUDITRPC.exe` process, which is typically associated with permission issues or hung states.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Ensured that the user account specified in the Connection Profile had the necessary permissions as outlined in the [Applet Mode Permissions documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/AppletModePermissions.htm).
2. Verified that the port requirements between the StealthAudit Server and the FC02 server were met, as detailed in the [Applet Mode Port Requirements documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/AppletModePorts.htm).
3. As a workaround, changed the "Scan Server selection" to "Local server" by navigating to:
   ```
   1_FSAC_SystemScans > Configure > Queries > Right-Click Activity Scan Query > select properties > Click "Configure" > set Scan Server selection to Local Server
   ```
4. After implementing these changes, the scan job was successfully executed.

## Notes
- Ensure that the user account specified in the Connection Profile always has the required permissions for File System Applet mode scans.
- Regularly verify that the necessary ports are open and accessible between the StealthAudit Server and the file servers to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If issues persist, consider switching the scan server selection to "Local server" as a temporary workaround.
