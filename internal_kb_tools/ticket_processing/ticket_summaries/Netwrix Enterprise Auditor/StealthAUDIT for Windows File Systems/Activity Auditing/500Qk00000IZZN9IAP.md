## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IZZN9IAP
- **Case Number:** 427708
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Rowan University
- **Contact Name:** Michael Davie
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a folder and files were deleted from a network shared drive and requested assistance in identifying who deleted the files.

## Environment Details
- The activity monitoring agent was installed on multiple file servers.
- The log file path in the System Activity Monitor (SAM) was incorrectly configured.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the type of file system where the deleted items resided (network shared drive).
2. Reviewed the configuration of the log file path in SAM.
3. Identified that the log file path was set as:
   ```
   SBTFileMon_Logs<SERVER_NAME>_Log_.tsv
   ```
4. Determined the correct log file path should be:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDITFSAC\SBTFileMon_Logs\<SERVER_NAME>_Log_.tsv
   ```
5. Attempted to retrieve deletion data but found it was not available due to the misconfiguration.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration of the log file path in SAM, which prevented the system from capturing the necessary activity logs related to file deletions.

## Solution
The log file path was corrected to the appropriate directory:
```
C:\Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthAUDITFSAC\SBTFileMon_Logs\<SERVER_NAME>_Log_.tsv
```
Additionally, the "Report UNC path" option was enabled in the file output settings to ensure proper logging in the future. Although the specific deletion data was not recoverable, the configuration change will allow for accurate tracking of future deletions.

## Notes
- Ensure that log file paths are correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify the settings in SAM to ensure that all necessary logging features are enabled.
