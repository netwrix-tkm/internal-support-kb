- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a warning during the FSAC (File System Activity Collection) scan indicating that the INI section for specific hosts (FC06 and FC02) did not exist in the configuration file `C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC\SBTFileMon.ini`.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed on the FC06 and FC02 hosts.
- The configuration file path is `C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDIT\FSAC\SBTFileMon.ini`.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the warning message generated during the FSAC scan.
2. Inspected the "Monitored Hosts" settings in the Activity Monitor console for FC06 and FC02.
3. Noted that the "report the hostname as:" setting was configured to use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
4. Identified that the hostname reported by the Activity Monitor did not match the expected hostname in the INI file.
5. Suggested scheduling a remote support session for further troubleshooting due to the complexity of potential root causes.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch between the hostname configuration in the Netwrix Activity Monitor and the expected hostname in the SBTFileMon.ini file. Specifically, the Activity Monitor was reporting the hostnames using FQDN (e.g., `fc06.example.domain`), while the INI file was expecting just the NETBIOS name (e.g., `FC06`).

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Changed the "report the hostname as:" setting in the Monitored Hosts section of the Activity Monitor console from FQDN to NETBIOS name for both FC06 and FC02 hosts.
2. After making this change, the Activity Monitor began reporting the hosts as `FC06` and `FC02` without the domain part.
3. The FSAC job was then able to complete successfully for the FC06 file server.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the hostname settings in the Activity Monitor match the expected format in the SBTFileMon.ini file to avoid similar issues in the future.
- A separate ticket was created for a different issue encountered with the FC02 host, which failed to complete the FSAC job with a different error message.
