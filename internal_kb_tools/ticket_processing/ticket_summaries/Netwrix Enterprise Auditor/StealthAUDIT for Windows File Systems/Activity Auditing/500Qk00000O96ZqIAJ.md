- **Case Number:** 442356
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TSMC
- **Contact Name:** Jimmy Chen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Activity Auditing
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, TSMC, inquired about the report of unique Trustees generated by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. They specifically wanted clarification on why some Trustees are represented by Security Identifiers (SIDs) instead of account names and the meaning of "Identical Rights" in the context of the Broken Inheritance report.

## Environment Details
- The report in question targets NetApp storage.
- The issue involves the translation of Windows SIDs to Active Directory accounts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the report type being run was the Broken Inheritance report.
2. Clarified that the report targets NetApp storage rather than Windows file share servers.
3. Explained that "Identical Rights" indicates that a trustee has the same permissions on both the parent folder and the subfolder being examined.
4. Informed the customer that the presence of SIDs without corresponding accounts suggests that those accounts may no longer exist in Active Directory.
5. Provided a PowerShell command to verify if accounts exist against a specific SID:
   ```powershell
   $SID = "S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234"
   $objSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier($SID)
   $user = Get-ADUser -Filter { ObjectSID -eq $objSID }
   $user
   ```

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the lack of a built-in mechanism in NetApp to translate Windows SIDs to Active Directory accounts. This results in SIDs being displayed in reports when the corresponding user accounts are no longer present in Active Directory.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying the meaning of "Identical Rights" and explaining the implications of seeing SIDs instead of account names. The customer was advised to run the Active Directory Inventory job to update the data and ensure that SIDs are translated to corresponding accounts if they still exist in Active Directory.

## Notes
- It is important for users to ensure that Active Directory domains from which users are connecting to NetApp are scanned and added to the system to facilitate proper SID translation.
- Customers can submit feature requests through the Netwrix Ideas Portal for enhancements related to SID translation capabilities.
