## Problem Description
The customer reported that the "SHELL_ALLUserAccount" activity scan job was failing with a deadlock error, resulting in improper reports due to the collection job returning an error. The specific error message indicated that the transaction was deadlocked on lock resources with another process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer reported the deadlock error: 
   ```
   "Transaction (Process ID 86) was deadlocked on lock resources with another process and has been chosen as the deadlock victim. Rerun the transaction."
   ```
2. Support requested the customer to provide additional details and collect debug logs.
3. Customer was informed to rerun the transaction to see if the issue persisted.
4. Customer confirmed that the error resolved itself and the activity scan was running as expected.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the deadlock issue was not identified. It was noted that the issue resolved on its own after a retry of the job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer reran the "SHELL_ALLUserAccount" activity scan job, which then completed successfully without errors. No further action was required as the job began functioning as expected.

## Notes
- The customer indicated that they would reopen the ticket if the issue recurred.
- It is advisable to monitor for similar deadlock errors in the future and consider implementing logging to capture more detailed information if the issue arises again.
