- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that FSAA scans were erroring due to discrepancies between Tier 1 and Tier 2 database files. The error message indicated that the Access data needed to be reset to import the data correctly.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred after an upgrade to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The error specifically mentioned that the Tier 2 database did not match the Tier 1 data.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that scans and Bulk Import (BI) were configured correctly.
2. Attempted to run a Repair Hosts action.
3. Suggested resetting the Access data by setting `AccessGUID` to 'RESET' in the `SA_FSAA_Hosts` table.
4. Discussed the implications of resetting the Access data, which would delete existing data in Tier 1.
5. Ran the "Reset Hosts" action in Maintenance for all affected tables.
6. Checked the Bulk Import and Scan results after the reset.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a mismatch between the Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases, likely due to changes made during the upgrade to version 11.6. This discrepancy required the Access data to be reset to ensure proper synchronization between the two tiers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing the following steps:
- Ran the "Repair Hosts" action instead of the "Reset Hosts" action, which fixed the discrepancies in the Tier 2 database.
- After the repair, a complete rescan was performed to ensure that the data was correctly populated in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases.

## Notes
- It is important to back up the `SA_FSAA_Hosts` table before performing any reset actions, as resetting will delete existing data in Tier 1.
- There is currently no bulk select option for the "Reset Hosts" action; each host must be selected individually.
- Future cases involving discrepancies between Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases should consider running a Repair action first before resorting to data resets.
