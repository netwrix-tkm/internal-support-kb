- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit

- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** FSAA Job
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues while testing the FSAA scan after upgrading to version 11.6. They encountered errors indicating that the 'Create Schema Job' needed to be run, but this job was disabled. The customer sought clarification on the potential impact of running this job in their production environment.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the status of the 'Create Schema Job' and confirmed it was disabled.
2. Reviewed the error messages generated during the FSAA scan.
3. Consulted documentation regarding the 'Create Schema Job' and its implications for the production environment.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the upgrade to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which required the 'Create Schema Job' to be executed on all NEA servers that had been upgraded.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the customer was instructed to run the 'Create Schema Job' on every NEA server that had been upgraded to version 11.6. The specific steps provided were:
- Navigate to the following documentation: [Create Schema Job Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/FileSystem/Collection/0-Create_Schema.htm)
- Follow the path: `FileSystem > 0.Collection > 0-Create Schema > Configure node and select Analysis`
- Execute the 'Create Tables' job, which creates all tables prefaced with `SA_FSAA_`. This action resolved the error messages encountered during the FSAA scan.

## Notes
- It is important to run the 'Create Schema Job' after upgrading to version 11.6 to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Customers should be cautious when running jobs in a production environment and ensure they have backups or a rollback plan in place.
