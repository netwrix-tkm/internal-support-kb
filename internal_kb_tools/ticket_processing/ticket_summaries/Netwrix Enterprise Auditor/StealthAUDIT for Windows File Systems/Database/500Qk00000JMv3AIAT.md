- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JMv3AIAT
- **Case Number:** 429538
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Compétences & Développement - Education Network
- **Contact Name:** Cyril Menigoz
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the StealthAUDIT application where the database file size exceeded 250GB, leading to a "Root element is missing" error throughout the application. The primary concern was the high cost of server hosting due to excessive disk space usage.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Application:** StealthAUDIT
- **Database Table of Concern:** StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Analyzed disk usage on the SQL server and identified that the `StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped` table was consuming most of the disk space.
2. Disabled the `4.Content > Tags > FS_FileTags` job for both File System storages configured for auditing in StealthAUDIT.
3. Executed the SQL command to truncate the `SA_FS_TagsMapped` table:
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped;
   ```
4. Verified that truncating the table freed up space within the database container, but did not reclaim disk space.
5. Initiated a database shrinking operation from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to attempt to reclaim disk space.

## Root Cause
The excessive disk space usage was primarily due to the accumulation of data in the `StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped` table, which was created by the `FS_FileTags` job. The truncation of this table did not automatically reclaim the physical disk space, necessitating a database shrink operation.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Disabling the job that was populating the `SA_FS_TagsMapped` table to prevent further data accumulation.
2. Truncating the contents of the table to free up space within the database.
3. Performing a database shrink operation in SSMS, which successfully reclaimed the disk space.

## Notes
- After truncating a table, it is important to perform a database shrink operation if physical disk space needs to be reclaimed.
- Customers should be advised to monitor their database size and consider regular maintenance tasks to prevent similar issues in the future.
- As a last resort, if the customer does not require the data stored in the NEA database, a complete deletion and reinstallation of the software could be considered.
