- **Case Number:** 440611
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** GlaxoSmithKline
- **Contact Name:** Olaf Wi≈õniewski
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Bulk Import
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during a bulk import job on the host named BREDSNTP008. The error message indicated that the database disk image was malformed, leading to a failure in the import process.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Installed Software:** 
  - StealthAUDIT V11.5
  - Stealthbits Activity Monitor
  - StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data
  - StealthAUDIT Access Information

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run a repair in maintenance mode for the host.
2. The error message was confirmed: "database disk image is malformed."
3. The customer provided logs and configuration settings for analysis.
4. Debug logging was enabled to capture detailed logs during the failing jobs.
5. The support team analyzed the logs and identified potential database corruption.
6. The support team consulted with senior engineers regarding the root cause.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as corruption in the T1/T2 databases. This corruption was likely caused by interference from the CrowdStrike Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP), which is known to disrupt write processes, potentially leading to database issues.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. The customer was advised to back up the T1/T2 databases due to the impending data loss.
2. The support team confirmed that dropping the corrupted T1/T2 tables was necessary to restore functionality.
3. The customer agreed to proceed with dropping the tables.
4. After the drop, the bulk import and scan jobs were successfully executed without errors.

## Notes
- It is crucial to implement exclusions for the CrowdStrike EPP to prevent similar issues in the future. The customer was provided with a link to the necessary exclusions documentation.
- Regular backups of the databases are recommended to mitigate data loss risks associated with database corruption.
