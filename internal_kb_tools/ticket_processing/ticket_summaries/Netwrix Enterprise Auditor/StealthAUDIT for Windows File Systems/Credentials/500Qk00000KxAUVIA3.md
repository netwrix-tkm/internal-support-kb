## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when attempting to scan newly added servers in their environment. The error message indicated that the scan session could not be initialized due to issues with certificate exchange.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved multiple hosts within the W.R. Berkley Corporation's network.
- The error was specifically related to the certificate exchange process during the authentication of the service account.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs which indicated a failure in certificate exchange.
2. Noted that both the service account and the local system account were unable to establish a secure stream for certificate exchange.
3. Identified that the default profile was not receiving the necessary permissions, causing a fallback to the system account.
4. Attempted to run the scan jobs with the default service account, which resulted in the same error.
5. Changed the job configuration to specify a different service account for the scanning tasks.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incorrect permissions for the default profile, which prevented the service account from successfully exchanging certificates. This led to a fallback to the system account, which also failed due to the same underlying issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the job configuration to run with a specified service account instead of the default. This allowed the scan jobs to authenticate properly and complete without errors. The job was then set to run across all hosts in the host list, confirming that the issue was resolved.

## Notes
- Ensure that service accounts have the necessary permissions and configurations to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the certificate exchange process closely when adding new hosts to the environment to catch potential issues early.
- Document any changes made to job configurations for future reference and troubleshooting.
