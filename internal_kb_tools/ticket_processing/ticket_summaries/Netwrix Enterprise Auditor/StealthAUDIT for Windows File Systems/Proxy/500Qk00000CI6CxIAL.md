## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CI6CxIAL
- **Case Number:** 413004
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Extron Electronics
- **Contact Name:** Stephen Byrd
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Proxy
- **Version:** 11.6.0.79

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during processing indicating that "StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Components are not installed" after performing a Proxy and Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) upgrade along with changes to environment variables.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA):** 11.6.0.79
- **NEA Access Information Center (AIC):** 11.6.0.15
- **NEA Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD):** 11.6.0.12
- **NEA FSAA Proxy:** 11.6.0.25
- All file servers are Windows-based.
- No scoping outside of the 12 level depth.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current versions of the Stealth applications running in the environment.
2. Ran troubleshooting scripts (`SA_JOBs_troubleshooting` and `FSAA_Proxy_Details`) on the NEA host and test Proxy.
3. Identified that the Log Maintenance process was incorrectly removing the `README.txt` file from the Proxy host.
4. Attempted to run scans which failed due to missing components.
5. Copied the `README.txt` file from the main server to the Proxy servers.
6. Restarted the Proxy sensitive data scans after copying the necessary files.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Log Maintenance process that was set to clean up the Proxy FSAA logs, which inadvertently removed the `README.txt` file necessary for the SDD to function correctly.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
- Removed the `.txt` extension from the Save Last Analysis configuration, preventing the `README.txt` files from being added to the cleanup table.
- This change ensured that the `README.txt` file was retained during log maintenance, allowing the SDD scans to complete successfully.

## Notes
- The scans have completed successfully multiple times since the changes were made.
- The ticket can be closed, but the customer has 30 days to reopen it if any related issues arise.
- Future cases should ensure that necessary files are not removed during maintenance processes to avoid similar issues.
