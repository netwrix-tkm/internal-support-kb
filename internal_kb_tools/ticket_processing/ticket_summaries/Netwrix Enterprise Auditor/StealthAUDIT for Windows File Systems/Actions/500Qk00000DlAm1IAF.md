## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DlAm1IAF
- **Case Number:** 416540
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America
- **Contact Name:** Venkata Deepthi Dammalapati
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** File System Action Module
- **Feature:** Actions
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when executing the File System Action Module, the process fails with an error indicating that the input table is version 2, while version 1 is expected.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message indicating a version mismatch (version 2 vs. expected version 1).
2. Compared the "Path to Execute" of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Action Module Applet service with the actual installation path `%sainstalldir%FileSystemAM`.
3. Attempted to locate the executable path of the service to confirm its installation directory.
4. Suggested uninstalling the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Action Module Applet via the NEA Action Configuration or using the command `sc delete StealthAUDITFSAM`.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Action Module service expecting the executable and libraries to be installed in a specific location, but they were actually installed in a different directory. This discrepancy led to the version mismatch error.

## Solution
1. Uninstalled the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Action Module Applet using the NEA Action Configuration or by executing the command:
   ```bash
   sc delete StealthAUDITFSAM
   ```
2. Re-executed the configured action via the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which allowed the service to be reinstalled in the correct location.

## Notes
- Ensure that the installation paths for the executable and libraries are correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to check the "Path to Execute" property of the service in the Services panel if similar errors occur.
- A hotfix was mentioned to correct filesystem action module DLLs, which may be relevant for future reference.
