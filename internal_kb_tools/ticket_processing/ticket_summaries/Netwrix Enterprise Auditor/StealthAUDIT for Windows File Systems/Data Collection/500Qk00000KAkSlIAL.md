## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KAkSlIAL
- **Case Number:** 431091
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TSMC
- **Contact Name:** SHENG CHANG CHEN
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message stating, "The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN key" when running the "create schema" job after upgrading to version 11.6 of the Netwrix product.

## Environment Details
- The issue was not reproducible in the customer's lab environment.
- The error occurred in the production environment after an upgrade from version 7.0 to 7.6.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run the "create schema" job, which triggered the error.
2. The customer ran the repair wizard multiple times under the FSAA query's maintenance option, but the issue persisted.
3. The support team requested the customer to provide logs and the DataAnalysisTasks.xml file from the Jobs folder for further investigation.
4. The R&D team was engaged to investigate a possible bug in the create FSAC tables.sql script.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a potential bug in the SQL script used during the creation of FSAC tables, which led to conflicts with foreign key constraints in the database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved when the customer reset the host. After this action, the error message disappeared, allowing the "create schema" job to run successfully.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that the correct DataAnalysisTasks.xml file is provided for troubleshooting, as incorrect files can lead to confusion and delays in resolution.
- Future cases involving similar foreign key constraint errors should consider checking for potential bugs in SQL scripts and recommend host resets as a potential solution.
