- **Case Number:** 426978
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** West Yavapai Guidance Clinic, DBA Polara Health
- **Contact Name:** Josh Taylor
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6.0.113

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the File System Audit Collection (FSAC) system scan was completing with an error indicating that a connection attempt failed due to the connected party not responding. The specific error message was: "A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond IP:8767."

## Environment Details
- Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version: 11.6.0.113
- Ports involved: 8766 and 8767
- The environment includes a failover cluster with servers WYDOC3 and WYDOC4.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that NEA was unable to communicate with the required host on ports 8766 and 8767.
2. Investigated potential network or firewall issues that could be blocking the necessary ports.
3. Identified that an inbound firewall rule for the Stealth Audit Applet was disabled on WYDOC4, while it was enabled on WYDOC3.
4. Adjusted the inbound firewall rule to allow TCP traffic on both ports 8766 and 8767 for WYDOC3 and WYDOC4.
5. Re-ran the FSAC job to verify if the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the firewall settings. Specifically, an inbound firewall rule for the Stealth Audit Applet was turned off on WYDOC4, preventing communication on the required ports.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling the inbound firewall rule for the Stealth Audit Applet on WYDOC4, allowing TCP traffic on ports 8766 and 8767. After making this adjustment, the FSAC job was successfully executed without errors.

## Notes
- Ensure that firewall rules are consistently applied across all nodes in a failover cluster to prevent similar issues in the future.
