- **Case Number:** 433500
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** John Deere Company
- **Contact Name:** Scott Prigge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) was returning historical data in filesystem scans. The scans were configured to only scan up to 5 levels deep, while the requirement was to scan at least 8 levels deep. This limitation resulted in outdated data being presented, affecting the reliability of the information for current use cases.

## Environment Details
- The filesystem details were limited to 3 levels deep, preventing updates for objects located below this level.
- The issue had persisted for multiple years due to a lack of administrative attention.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified that the FSAA scans were not configured to scan to the required depth.
2. Dropped data for the flagged host to reset the scan parameters.
3. Ran a rescan after adjusting the scan depth settings.
4. Confirmed via UNC path that the folder in question did not exist.
5. Utilized the FSAA Remove Host option to clear host data from SQL tables.
6. Cleared paths from the AIC view post the Remove Host data job completion.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the FSAA scans were no longer scanning to the same or lower depths where the filesystem objects resided. This was compounded by old paths still being present in the local Tier 2 SQLite databases, which prevented accurate updates of deleted items.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Removing the host data from all SQL tables created by the FSAA Data Collector.
- Renaming or removing the host folder from the FSAA paths on the NEA host and the Proxy Server.
- Running a rescan to ensure that the updated scan depth settings were applied, allowing for accurate data collection.

## Notes
- Scans are non-destructive to the data collected; if an object is deleted, the new scan will add a value to the DeleteUSN.
- For future cases, ensure that the scan depth is configured correctly to meet the data collection requirements.
- Consider regular administrative reviews to prevent similar issues from arising due to lack of attention to configuration settings.
