- **Case Number:** 442874
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited
- **Contact Name:** James Allen
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether Netwrix could be used to analyze file access for an on-premise installation of Bentley Projectwise, similar to how it functions for a regular Windows file server.

## Environment Details
- The inquiry was related to file access analysis for Bentley Projectwise.
- The customer was looking for a setup that would allow monitoring similar to a standard Windows file server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication with the customer to clarify their monitoring needs and endpoint specifications.
2. Investigation into whether Netwrix has existing customers using the product in similar environments.
3. Consultation with upper-level teams regarding the compatibility of Netwrix with Bentley Projectwise.
4. Confirmation that the setup is not inherently supported but could potentially work with a basic File Server setup.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was that Bentley Projectwise is not a supported data source for Netwrix, which limits the ability to perform file access analysis as requested by the customer.

## Solution
The customer was informed that while the specific setup for Bentley Projectwise is not officially supported, it might work with the basic File Server setup. They were also directed to the Netwrix Ideas Portal to submit feature requests for future enhancements.

## Notes
- Customers should be aware that unsupported setups may not function as expected, and they should follow up with support if issues arise.
- It is recommended to utilize the Netwrix Ideas Portal for submitting feature requests to influence future product developments.
