- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LE9fKIAT
- **Case Number:** 434040
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** State of Delaware
- **Contact Name:** Kevin Graber
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that some scans were taking excessively long, with durations ranging from 70 to 90 hours. They sought improvements and recommendations from Netwrix to enhance scan performance.

## Environment Details
- The customerâ€™s system is equipped with 16 processors and 48 GB of memory.
- The version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor in use is 11.6.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed job properties and adjusted the performance settings:
   - Changed the number of threads from the default to 4 in the Job Properties > Performance tab.
2. Modified the Sensitive Data Settings in the NEA > FSSA Data Collector Wizard:
   - Increased the number of SDD Scan processes from 2 to 5.
3. Disabled DEBUG logging for the job to reduce overhead.
4. Conducted a meeting to discuss findings and further optimizations.

## Root Cause
The initial long scan times were attributed to suboptimal configuration settings, including a low number of threads and scan processes, as well as the overhead caused by DEBUG logging.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing the following changes:
- Increased the number of threads to 4 in the Job Properties.
- Adjusted the number of SDD Scan processes to 5 in the NEA settings.
- Turned off DEBUG logging for the job, which significantly reduced processing time.

As a result of these adjustments, the processing time for scans was drastically reduced, with one specific scan (DFSFP01) taking only 2 hours and 37 minutes compared to previous durations of up to 114 hours.

## Notes
- For future reference, it is advisable to regularly review and optimize scan settings based on system capabilities and workload.
- Consider splitting larger jobs into smaller tasks if certain scans consistently take an excessive amount of time.
- Monitor performance after changes to ensure that the adjustments yield the desired improvements without introducing new issues.
