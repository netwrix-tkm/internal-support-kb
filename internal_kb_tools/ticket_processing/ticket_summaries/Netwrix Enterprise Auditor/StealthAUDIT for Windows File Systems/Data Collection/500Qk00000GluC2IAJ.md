## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GluC2IAJ
- **Case Number:** 423240
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Kyndryl
- **Contact Name:** Fenilkumar S
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about the possibilities of configuring job scans for Azure Cloud shares using NetApp in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT).

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Product Version:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the capabilities of the "AnyData for Azure Files" add-on, which is limited to sensitive data and does not support Azure Files.
2. Confirmed that the FSAA/FSAC scan of Azure NetApp Files is currently roadmapped but not yet available.
3. Verified that while NAM can gather activity from Azure CVO, the FSAC does not support it, preventing activity data from being imported into Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the fact that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor does not currently support Azure Files, and the relevant features for scanning Azure NetApp Files are still in development.

## Solution
The resolution involved clarifying the current limitations of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor regarding Azure Cloud shares and informing the customer that the feature is roadmapped for future implementation. The customer was advised to monitor updates from the product team for an estimated timeline on feature availability.

## Notes
- The "AnyData for Azure Files" add-on is only applicable for sensitive data and does not integrate with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The FSAA/FSAC scan for Azure NetApp Files is planned but not yet available; customers should be informed of this limitation.
- It is important to keep track of product updates for any changes in feature availability related to Azure integrations.
