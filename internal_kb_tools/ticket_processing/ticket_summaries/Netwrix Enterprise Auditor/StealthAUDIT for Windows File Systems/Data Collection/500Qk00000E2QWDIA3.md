## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2QWDIA3
- **Case Number:** 417114
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KBR, Inc. (Kellogg Brown & Root LLC)
- **Contact Name:** Tanya Hyland
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that all File System Scheduled Tasks (FSAA, FSAC, and SEEK) stopped running after a few minutes, leaving a `running.lck` file. The tasks would complete successfully when run manually but failed to execute properly when scheduled. This issue began after the customer returned from vacation on July 26th, and no changes were made to the system during their absence.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Not specified
- **Third-party Security Tool:** Trellix (formerly McAfee)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the scheduled tasks were configured correctly.
2. Attempted to delete and recreate one of the scheduled tasks.
3. Updated the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor from version 11.6.0.86 to 11.6.0.88.
4. Checked the logs for any error messages related to the scheduled tasks.
5. Reviewed Group Policy settings, specifically the "Network access: Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM" policy.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by an update to the third-party security tool Trellix (formerly McAfee), which interfered with the scheduled tasks' ability to run properly.

## Solution
The resolution involved adjusting the settings of the Trellix security tool to allow the scheduled tasks to execute without interruption. After making the necessary adjustments, the scheduled tasks resumed normal operation.

## Notes
- Ensure that any third-party security tools are compatible with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, especially after updates.
- Regularly review and test scheduled tasks after any significant changes to the system or security configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
