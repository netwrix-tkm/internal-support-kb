## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DB8HJIA1
- **Case Number:** 415211
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MANCOSA
- **Contact Name:** Ziyaad Rasool
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where the filesystem permission scan could not be initiated. The error logs indicated that certain libraries could not be loaded, leading to an unauthorized operation error.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Error Logs:** Included warnings about missing libraries (CPasswordSDK.dll and libeay32.dll) and an unauthorized operation during the scan initiation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified filesystem permissions for Local Mode, Applet Mode, and Proxy Mode scans.
2. Checked if the service account was locked out or if it had the necessary permissions.
3. Reviewed error logs for specific error messages related to the scan initiation.
4. Confirmed access to the local admin group and UNC access to the host.
5. Suggested checking for the presence of CyberArk and its impact on the scan.
6. Deleted the FSAA Certificate Authority Store and FSAA Client Certificate Store certificates on the NEA host.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by the presence of invalid or corrupted certificates in the FSAA Certificate Authority Store and FSAA Client Certificate Store, which prevented the scan from initiating successfully. Additionally, missing libraries (CPasswordSDK.dll and libeay32.dll) contributed to the problem.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting the FSAA Certificate Authority Store and FSAA Client Certificate Store certificates on the NEA host. After the deletion, the filesystem permission scan was successfully initiated.

## Notes
- Ensure that the necessary libraries (CPasswordSDK.dll and libeay32.dll) are correctly installed and accessible in the specified directories.
- Regularly check and maintain the integrity of the FSAA Certificate Authority and Client Certificate Stores to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If using third-party password management systems like CyberArk, confirm compatibility with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version in use.
