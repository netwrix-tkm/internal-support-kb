## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K4EKDIA3
- **Case Number:** 430935
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Inland Empire Health Plan
- **Contact Name:** Justin Cahill
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Data Collection
- **Feature:** File System Access Auditing (FSAA)
- **Version:** 11.6.0.125

## Problem Description
After upgrading the customer to the latest versions of Netwrix software on 12/20/2024, the File System Access Auditing (FSAA) job was not completing, and subsequent jobs were not starting past the bulk import stage. The logs indicated minimal information, and the task scheduler reported an exit code of 0 after bulk import attempts.

## Environment Details
- **Console Server Software Versions:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6 (11.6.0.125)
  - Netwrix Access Information Center (11.6.0.25)
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit (7.1.234)
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor (7.1.234)
  - Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6 (11.6.0.14)
- **Proxy Server Software Versions:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Scanning Proxy (11.6.0.36)
  - Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6 (11.6.0.14)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked logs for errors; minimal information was available.
2. Verified task scheduler exit codes; confirmed exit code 0 after bulk import.
3. Identified and manually deleted a running lock (*.lck) file in the directory:
   ```
   0.CollectionGROUP_0.CollectionGROUP_FSAAJOB_1-FSAA System Scans
   ```
4. Limited FSAA to scan only two hosts at a time.
5. Adjusted scoping on the HSP1M1 file server to skip rapidly changing paths.
6. Ran the job with different configurations (limited depth, host counts).
7. Monitored the job status and logs for any signs of progress or errors.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by insufficient hardware resources and potential resource contention, exacerbated by the complexity of the environment involving multiple servers and a proxy. The presence of a lock file also contributed to the job not completing.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing the following changes:
1. Added `FSAAScanHost.exe` to antivirus exclusions to prevent interference.
2. Limited FSAA to scan only two hosts at a time to reduce resource load.
3. Adjusted the HSP1M1 file server settings to skip certain paths that changed frequently.
4. Deleted the identified lock file, which allowed the job to proceed without being blocked.

After these adjustments, the FSAA job was able to complete successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that antivirus exclusions are set for critical executables like `FSAAScanHost.exe` to avoid job interruptions.
- Monitor resource usage closely in environments with multiple servers and large file counts to prevent contention issues.
- Consider limiting the number of concurrent scans in resource-constrained environments to improve job stability and completion rates.
