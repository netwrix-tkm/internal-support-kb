- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Hy1aaIAB
- **Case Number:** 426268
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KPMG Management Services LP
- **Contact Name:** Jason Skidmore
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the File Server All Activity job was failing with the error: 
`Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied`. The customer required the results of this job urgently for a legal issue.

## Environment Details
- The issue began occurring on 8/14, and the customer needed data from 8/31 and 11/4. Data for 8/31 was not available, but data for 11/4 was retrievable.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected debug logs from the All Activity job by setting the log level to DEBUG.
2. Installed hotfix HF 11.6.0.57 on the NEA server.
3. Updated the proxy server using the FS_UpdateProxy job.
4. Set the Applet Launch Mechanism to "Require applet to be running as a service on target".
5. Ran the FSAC System Scan on multiple hosts to check for successful connections to the proxy.
6. Discussed the use of the NAM console for investigating and exporting results.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration of the proxy settings, which led to the inability to initialize scan sessions. The jobs were also failing due to a lack of proper host lists for the proxies.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Installing the necessary hotfix and updating the proxy settings.
- Correctly configuring the Applet Launch Mechanism.
- Ensuring that each job pointed to the correct proxy host list.
- After making these adjustments, the FSAC System Scan jobs were successfully executed on multiple hosts.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Applet Launch Mechanism is correctly set for future jobs to avoid similar issues.
- Regularly verify that proxy settings and host lists are correctly configured to prevent scan initialization failures.
- Monitor the job logs for any recurring errors after configuration changes.
