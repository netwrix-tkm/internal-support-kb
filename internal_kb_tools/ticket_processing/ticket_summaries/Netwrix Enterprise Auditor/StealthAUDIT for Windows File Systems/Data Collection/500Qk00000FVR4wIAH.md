- **Case Number:** 420389
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Excellus Health Plan, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Gary Bender
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a mismatch between the Tier 2 database and Tier 1 data, indicating that the access data needed to be reset. They encountered an error when attempting to remove a Host ID from the SA_FSAA_Resources table after dropping tables.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 90
- **Age:** 16.1

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Identified the error message: "Failed to remove Host ID: 37 from table SA_FSAA_Resources."
2. Investigated the AIC host installation for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).
3. Noted that the FSAC bulk import was incorrectly set to remove all hosts.
4. Discussed the possibility of adding a FS MAINTENANCE job to the zSandbox Group for future data drops.
5. Explored the option of resetting the Access GUID column value in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table to resolve the GUID mismatch.
6. Reviewed documentation on the Maintenance Wizard for resetting hosts.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration in the AIC host installation for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, where the FSAC bulk import was set to remove all hosts, leading to the mismatch and subsequent errors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adjusting the FSAC bulk import settings to prevent the removal of all hosts.
- Adding a FS MAINTENANCE job to the zSandbox Group for future data management.
- Running the ADI and FSAA jobs to ensure the AIC Web UI was correctly populated with the necessary data.

## Notes
- It is not recommended to have both Production and Test environments point to the same Activity Monitor, although it is possible if all builds are identical.
- File Servers can be managed by either Intercept or Audit, but only the NAM collected details will feed into Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- For resetting the Access GUID, refer to the Maintenance Wizard in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 as a less destructive alternative to dropping tables.
- The Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) tool is recommended for tracking Active Directory activity, with reporting capabilities available through the Netwrix Threat Manager (NTM) Reporting Module.
