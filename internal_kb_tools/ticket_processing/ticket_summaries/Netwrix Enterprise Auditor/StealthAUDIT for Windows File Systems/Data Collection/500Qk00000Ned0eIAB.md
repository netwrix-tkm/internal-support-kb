## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ned0eIAB
- **Case Number:** 440878
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** EverBank
- **Contact Name:** Bradley Dickinson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on how to report where an Active Directory (AD) domain security group is applied to a file system share, folder, or file (or SharePoint). They specifically mentioned that the job "FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions_Results" was locking up the StealthAUDIT console when attempting to view the results.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** 11.5
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was asked to provide a screenshot and breadcrumb trail to the job in their NAA (or NEA) Console.
2. The support engineer inquired if the "FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions" job was a customization created by professional services, as it was not found in NEA v11.6.
3. The customer was informed about potential performance issues due to excessive data and long processing times.
4. The customer was advised to be patient while the job processed, as it was handling over 1 million rows of data.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a slight performance problem with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) due to the excessive amount of data being processed by the "FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions_Results" job, which caused the console to appear unresponsive.

## Solution
The customer was able to resolve the issue by allowing the job to complete processing in the background. Once the job finished, they were able to access the results without further issues. The customer confirmed that they obtained the necessary information from the 'Direct_Permissions_view' and decided to close the ticket.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers about potential performance issues when dealing with large datasets in the NEA.
- Encourage customers to be patient when processing large jobs, as the console may appear to lock up while the job is still running.
- Documentation regarding specific jobs, such as "FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions," should be clarified to avoid confusion about customizations.
