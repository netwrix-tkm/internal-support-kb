- **Account/Company:** W.R. Berkley Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Eric Van Brocklibn
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported encountering a `System.InvalidOperationException` error during FSAA scans on their secondary console server, specifically stating "Sequence contains more than one element." This error occurred on almost every server during the scanning process.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team advised the customer to run the "Create Schema" job manually by navigating to NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 0-Create Schema and selecting "Run Job."
2. The customer was instructed to check the "Job Statistics" to confirm if the job ran successfully.
3. The team also suggested reviewing the "Results" > "FSAA_DirectPermissionsView" to verify if data was being displayed correctly, indicating successful job execution.
4. Additional scenarios were provided explaining when it is necessary to run the "Create Schema" job, particularly after upgrades or cumulative updates.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the need to run the "Create Schema" job. This is typically required after an upgrade or when there are schema changes between versions, which can occur even after cumulative updates.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by successfully running the "Create Schema" job on the secondary console server. This action ensured that the file system schema was current and compatible with the version of the software being used, thereby eliminating the errors during FSAA scans.

## Notes
- It is important to run the "Create Schema" job after any major upgrades or cumulative updates to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regular checks on job statistics and results can help identify potential issues early in the scanning process.
- Customers should be informed that schema changes can occur frequently, necessitating periodic execution of the "Create Schema" job.
