## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LZUU9IAP
- **Case Number:** 434978
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** EverBank
- **Contact Name:** Bradley Dickinson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5.0.260

## Problem Description
The customer was attempting to create a custom StealthAUDIT job to locate file types with the .ONE extension for a new report.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) Version:** 11.5.0.260
- **File Data Collector:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the FileSystem >> 7.Sensitive Data >> FS_DLPResults for existing .ONE file entries.
2. Investigated the SA_FS_DLPResults_ShareDetails table for historical data on .ONE files.
3. Checked the File Data Collector settings in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 to ensure file-level scanning was enabled.
4. Explored the File Properties settings to confirm the ability to filter by specific file types.
5. Discussed the possibility of creating a custom job to minimize SQL Server impact and streamline data queries.

## Root Cause
The inability to locate current .ONE files was due to the limitations in the existing data collection settings and the need for a custom job to effectively query the necessary data without overloading the SQL Server.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by agreeing to create a custom job that would allow for targeted queries on the relevant tables/views to gather the required data for the report. Additionally, a feature request was submitted to allow the inclusion of custom file types, such as .ONE, in future updates.

## Notes
- It is recommended to enable file-level scanning and configure the File Properties settings to include specific file types when setting up data collectors.
- Future requests for custom file types should be documented and submitted to ensure they are considered in product updates.
