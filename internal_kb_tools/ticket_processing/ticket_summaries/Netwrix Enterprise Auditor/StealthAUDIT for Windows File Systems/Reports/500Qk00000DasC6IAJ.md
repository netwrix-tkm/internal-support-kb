- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DasC6IAJ
- **Case Number:** 416236
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MUFG Bank, LTD.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Kong
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** File System Solution
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a folder on one of their hosts, which had broken inheritance with both direct and inherited permissions, was not reflecting the updated permission changes after remediation. Despite running a full FSAA scan three times, the AIC still displayed both direct and inherited permissions as unchanged.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** 11.6
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Netwrix Activity Monitor Version:** 7.0

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that broken inheritance on the folder was remediated and verified directly.
2. Ran a full FSAA scan against the host three times.
3. Checked the `SA_FSAA_Resources` for the folder to verify if `accesslastseen` was up to date.
4. Investigated the FSAC job collecting the file system data.
5. Reviewed the NAM console for any errors related to the host.
6. Examined which operations were enabled in the Netwrix Activity Monitor.
7. Determined where the permissions change was made (assumed NTFS).
8. Searched for relevant events in the NAM console.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a caching problem within the FSAA query system, which was not reflecting the updated permissions due to outdated data.

## Solution
The resolution involved resetting the host under the FSAA query configuration and performing a bulk import. This action successfully refreshed the data, allowing the updated permissions to be accurately reflected in the system.

## Notes
- It is recommended to reset the FSAA query and perform a bulk import if similar issues arise in the future.
- Always verify the status of the `accesslastseen` attribute to ensure that the data is current before concluding that permissions are not updating.
- Regular checks of the NAM console for errors can help identify potential issues early in the troubleshooting process.
