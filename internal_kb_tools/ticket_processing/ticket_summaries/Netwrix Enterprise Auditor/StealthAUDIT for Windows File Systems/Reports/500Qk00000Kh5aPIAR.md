## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Kh5aPIAR
- **Case Number:** 432436
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Damus Aulu
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Sensitive Data Report was not populating with results when attempting to generate a report (spreadsheet) from the SEEK Bulk Import job. Despite having configured the SEEK jobs, the generated report contained no data.

## Environment Details
- **Reference Cases:** 00429711 & 0042434
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Modified the SEEK system scan reports and added the respective report to each cluster to populate the DLP results into a report.
2. Attempted to run the job to produce the report but found it still returned no data.
3. Reviewed the configuration of the FSDLP report to identify any potential misconfigurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the FSDLP report targeting the incorrect view, which resulted in no data being retrieved for the report.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, a new report was created under the SEEK Bulk Import job, specifically targeting the `FSDLP_MatchesView` table. This adjustment allowed the report to generate with the desired information. The process followed for creating the report was documented in the Netwrix help center, which can be referenced for future report creation:

## Notes
- Ensure that reports are configured to target the correct views to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to verify the functionality of reports after making any modifications to the SEEK system scans.
