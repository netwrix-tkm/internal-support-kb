- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000J53wqIAB
- **Case Number:** 428802
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Hydro Group Norway
- **Contact Name:** Saveetha Anesh
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported a data mismatch between the files present on their file server and the information displayed in the StealthAudit FS_FileTypes job table. Specifically, they noted discrepancies in the number and types of files listed in the report compared to the actual files located at the specified path.

## Environment Details
- **File Path:** `C:\HYDVNWI085005_N_MPSADIMPAAPOIO_ADMINISTRATIVOATA - REDIR`
- **Files Present:**
  - 2 DOC files
  - 1 DOCX file (described as Open Office XML Document)
  - 1 XLS file
  - 1 XLSX file

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the files present in the specified directory on the file server.
2. Inspected the FS_FileTypes job table in the StealthAudit database.
3. Compared the file types and counts in the database against the actual files on the server.
4. Clarified the file type description of the DOCX file to the customer, explaining that it is an Open Office document and not an XML document.
5. Provided the customer with a description of the 4.Content Job Group and the 'File Types > FS_FileTypes' Job.

## Root Cause
The confusion arose from the way the FS_FileTypes job table displayed the file counts. The table showed a single row for DOC files with a file count of 2, which accurately reflected the number of DOC files present. Additionally, the customer misinterpreted the DOCX file's description, mistaking it for an XML document due to its file type description.

## Solution
After confirming that the FS_FileTypes job table accurately represented the files on the server, the support team explained the table's structure and the file type descriptions to the customer. This clarification resolved the customer's concerns, confirming that there was no actual mismatch between the database and the file server.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers understand the structure of the FS_FileTypes job table and how file counts are represented.
- Clarify any potential confusion regarding file type descriptions, especially for files that may have non-standard extensions or descriptions.
