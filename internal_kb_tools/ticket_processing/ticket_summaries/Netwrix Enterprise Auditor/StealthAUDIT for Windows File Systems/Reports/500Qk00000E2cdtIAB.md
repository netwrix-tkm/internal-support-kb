## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2cdtIAB
- **Case Number:** 417126
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Sean Steinberg
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** NEA 11.6.0.69, AIC 11.6.0.12

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the FS_FileTags job in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, where an error occurred stating that a NULL value could not be inserted into the 'File Count' column of the 'SA_FS_FileTags_EnterpriseSummary' table, which does not allow nulls.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) Version:** 11.6.0.69
- **NEA Access Information Center (AIC) Version:** 11.6.0.12

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the versions of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Access Information Center running in the environment.
2. Investigated the FSAA job settings to determine if file-level details were being collected.
3. Noted that enabling file-level details, including tags, would require significantly larger SQL storage.
4. Cleared the report from the NEA URL and removed it from the console by renaming the install path folder to include "BU_".

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the FS_FileTags job not being configured to collect file-level details, which resulted in attempts to insert NULL values into a database column that does not accept them.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by enabling the collection of file-level details in the FSAA job settings. Additionally, the report was cleared from the NEA URL, and the installation path folder was renamed to prevent further conflicts.

## Notes
- Future implementations of file-level detail collection should consider the increased SQL storage requirements.
- Ensure that all necessary job settings are configured correctly to avoid similar NULL insertion errors.
