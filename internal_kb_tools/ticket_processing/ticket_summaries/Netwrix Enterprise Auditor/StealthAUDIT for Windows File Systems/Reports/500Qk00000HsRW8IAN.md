## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HsRW8IAN
- **Case Number:** 425976
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Polsinelli
- **Contact Name:** Brandon Artist
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when running the FS_Permission changes job, the report generation fails with the error message: "Sequence contains more than one matching element."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the FS_Permission changes job to identify the cause of the report generation failure.
2. Analyzed the report.xml file associated with the job for any anomalies.
3. Identified duplicate entries within the `<Reports>` section of the report.xml file.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by duplicate entries in the job and the report.xml file. This duplication prevented the report from populating correctly, as the system could not determine which field was the correct one to use.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the duplicate entries were removed from the `<Reports>` section of the report.xml file. After making these changes, the report generation was successful, and the job ran properly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the report.xml file is regularly checked for duplicate entries to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If the error "Sequence contains more than one matching element" occurs again, verify the report.xml file for duplicates as a first troubleshooting step.
