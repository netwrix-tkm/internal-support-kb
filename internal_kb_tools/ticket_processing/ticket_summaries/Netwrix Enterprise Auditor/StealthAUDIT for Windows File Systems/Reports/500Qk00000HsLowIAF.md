## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HsLowIAF
- **Case Number:** 425977
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Polsinelli
- **Contact Name:** Brandon Artist
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** Not specified

## Problem Description
The customer reported that when running the FileSystemOverview job, the report generation fails with the error message: "Sequence contains more than one matching element."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message generated during the report generation process.
2. Investigated the contents of the report.xml file associated with the FileSystemOverview job.
3. Identified duplicate entries within the `<Reports>` section of the report.xml file.
4. Attempted to run the report after identifying the duplicates to confirm the issue.

## Root Cause
The failure to generate the report was caused by duplicate entries in the job and the report.xml file. The system could not determine which field was the correct one due to these duplicates.

## Solution
The resolution involved removing the duplicate entries found between the `<Reports>` tags in the report.xml file. After these entries were cleaned up, the report generation process was successful, and the report ran properly.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for duplicate entries in the report.xml file for similar jobs, as they can lead to report generation failures.
- Future cases involving report generation issues should include a review of the report.xml file for duplicates as a standard troubleshooting step.
