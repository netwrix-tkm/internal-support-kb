## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N12fJIAR
- **Case Number:** 438997
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago
- **Contact Name:** Ryan Tyson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Reports
- **Feature:** SQLViewCreation
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in identifying a report that illustrates the movement of large files from specific folders within a file share. They needed details on the dates when the largest amounts of data were moved and the users responsible for these actions.

## Environment Details
- **Installed Software:**
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6 (Version 11.6.0.117)
  - Netwrix Access Information Center (Version 11.6.0.25)
  - Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6 (Version 11.6.0.13)
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor (Version 7.1.211)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Inquiry:** Gathered information from the customer regarding the impact of the issue and the specific details they were looking for.
2. **SQLViewCreation Analysis:** Suggested using the SQLViewCreation pointing to the `SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView` to filter data related to file movements.
3. **Performance Settings Check:** Noted an issue with the host dropping packets, which led to disabling the "Skip Hosts that do not respond to PING" option for FSAC scans and bulk import jobs.
4. **Report Generation:** Guided the customer on how to create a report using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's reporting features.
5. **Follow-Up Meetings:** Scheduled follow-up meetings to refine the report and ensure all necessary data was captured.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from a misunderstanding of how file movements were logged in the system. The customer was looking for a "copy" event, which does not exist in Windows; instead, multiple read events were logged for the same object, which could be misinterpreted as copying.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Utilizing the SQLViewCreation feature to filter and generate reports based on the `SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView`.
- Providing a TSQL query to help the customer identify non-read activities related to the files in question.
- Ensuring that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Activity Monitor were correctly configured to capture the necessary data.

## Notes
- Windows does not log a distinct "copy" event; it logs multiple read events for the same file, which can complicate data interpretation.
- Ensure that the "Skip Hosts that do not respond to PING" option is configured correctly to avoid missing data due to network issues.
- Follow-up meetings are crucial for refining reports and ensuring customer satisfaction with the provided solutions.
