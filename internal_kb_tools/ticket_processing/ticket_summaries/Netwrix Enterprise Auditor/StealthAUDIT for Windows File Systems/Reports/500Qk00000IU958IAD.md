## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IU958IAD
- **Case Number:** 427456
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Medpace, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Brittany Lac
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The File System Stale Content job was reporting incorrect data, showing only two shares when it should have included more. The job appeared to complete successfully without any errors in the logs, leading to confusion regarding its functionality.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to replace job files with a solution from Instant Solutions and reran the job.
2. The support engineer requested the job to be run in debug mode to gather more detailed logs.
3. The logs were reviewed to identify any underlying issues.
4. The job configuration was examined to determine the time frame for stale data.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a defect in the `FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary` analysis task, which did not correctly pull the necessary data for the job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by adjusting the SQL script used in the `SA_FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary` analysis task. The following changes were made to ensure the job correctly aggregated and reported the stale content data:

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary]') AND type in (N'U'))
DROP TABLE SA_FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary;
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[SA_FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary](
    [Share] [nvarchar](512) NOT NULL,
    [Folder Count] [int] NULL,
    [Last File Modification] [datetime] NULL,
    [Active Files] [bigint] NULL,
    [Stale Files] [bigint] NULL,
    [Percent Active] [int] NULL,
    [Percent Stale] [int] NULL,
    [StaleRank] [bigint] NULL
)
GO

insert into SA_FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary
SELECT '' + STV.HostName + '' + STV.ShareName +'' as [Share],
    COUNT(DISTINCT stv.folderid),
    MAX([Last Modified]) as [Last File Modification], 
    ISNULL(SUM(CAST([Active Files] as bigint)),0) AS [Active Files],
    ISNULL(SUM(CAST([Stale Files] as bigint)),0) AS [Stale Files],
    CASE WHEN (SUM(CAST([Stale Files] as bigint)) + SUM(CAST([Active Files] as bigint))) = 0
    THEN 0 
    ELSE 
    100.0 - FLOOR(SUM(CAST([Stale Files] as bigint))*100.0/(SUM(CAST([Stale Files] as bigint)) + SUM(CAST([Active Files] as bigint))))
    end,
    CASE WHEN (SUM(CAST([Stale Files] as bigint)) + SUM(CAST([Active Files] as bigint))) = 0
    THEN 0 
    ELSE

An internal escalation (Ticket #00428218) was raised to address this defect for other customers.

## Notes
- Ensure that the job configuration is reviewed periodically to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the job appears to complete successfully but does not return expected results, consider checking the underlying SQL scripts and data aggregation logic.
