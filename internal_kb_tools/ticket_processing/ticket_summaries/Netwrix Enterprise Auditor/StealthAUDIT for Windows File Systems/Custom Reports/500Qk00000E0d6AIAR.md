## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance on how to configure and run discovery for Windows shares using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- The customer has a custom job group that includes:
  - A job to discover and populate hosts.
  - A second job to run a PowerShell script to discover shares on the discovered hosts.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the custom job group.
2. Attempted to run the discovery job, which failed due to connectivity issues.
3. Identified that the NEA console was unable to reach the desired servers to check health status via PING.
4. Customized the job settings to bypass the PING status check before executing the job tasks.

## Root Cause
The NEA console was unable to perform a PING check to the target servers, which prevented the discovery job from running successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by customizing the job configuration to not check the PING status before executing the job tasks. After this adjustment, the discovery jobs ran successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the necessary network configurations allow for PING checks if required in future setups.
- It may be beneficial to consult with the DBA to configure the correct dataset in the database for optimal job performance.
