## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IL3BsIAL
- **Case Number:** 427167
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Synchrony Financial
- **Contact Name:** Vinooth Sangam
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Custom Reports
- **Feature:** CIFS Open Access Report
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in recreating a CIFS Open Access report that would automatically email a filtered version of the report to a specific distribution list on a weekly basis. The new report needed to display only records with a scan depth of 0 and for only one of their two hostnames, while maintaining the original report with both hostnames and a scan depth of 5.

## Environment Details
- **Data Gathering Depth:** Level 5 (current report)
- **Desired Data Gathering Depth:** Level 0 (new report)
- **Hostnames:** Two hostnames in the original report, one hostname required in the new report.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current report settings in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA).
2. Navigated to **Global Settings > Notifications** to set up email configurations.
3. Accessed **Jobs > "FileSystem" > "1-FSAA System Scans" > "Query Properties"** to check the default scoping settings.
4. Identified that the default scoping was set to limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels.
5. Discussed the need to create a new report that filters data to show only records with a scan depth of 0 and one hostname.
6. Conducted a meeting with the customer to clarify requirements and demonstrate the report creation process.

## Root Cause
The original report was configured to gather data up to a depth of 5 levels and included both hostnames. The customer needed a separate report that only displayed records with a scan depth of 0 for one hostname, which required creating a new report with specific filters.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by creating a new report in NEA based on the existing CIFS Open Access report. The following steps were taken:
1. Copied the existing report.
2. Pasted the report to create a new instance.
3. Configured the new report to filter for only one hostname and set the scan depth to 0.
4. Attached five annotated screenshots demonstrating the steps to copy and create the new report:
   - **SS01:** Copy Report
   - **SS02:** Paste Report
   - **SS03:** Configure Report
   - **SS04:** Widgets Configuration
   - **SS05:** Filter Editor

## Notes
- Ensure that users are familiar with the report creation process in NEA before attempting to create new reports based on existing ones.
- The customer was advised not to attempt creating the report without reviewing the provided screenshots if they were unsure of the steps.
- Future requests for similar report configurations should consider the need for separate reports to avoid confusion with existing data gathering settings.
