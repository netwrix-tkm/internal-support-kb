## Problem Description
The customer reported that a bulk import job was failing with the error message: "SQL logic error unknown database strucmap." The bulk import job did not start, which was linked to a failure in the FSAA system scan.

## Environment Details
- The FSAA system scan was set to a depth of 8 levels.
- The bulk import was configured to skip hosts that do not respond to ping, which was later disabled.
- The application log on the Netwrix server indicated a .NET runtime "unhandled exception" error with StealthAUDIT.exe.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the FSAA system scan had failed to complete, which was causing the bulk import job not to start.
2. Checked the application logs for errors related to the bulk import and FSAA system scan.
3. Disabled the option to skip over hosts that do not respond to ping.
4. Enabled the uploading of partial scans to allow the bulk import to proceed even if the FSAA system scan did not complete.
5. Ran a bulk import repair on the affected host using the following steps:
   - Navigated to FSAA Bulk import job > Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure > Maintenance > Repair.
6. Confirmed that the StructMap.dbaa3 file existed in the associated directory.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a failure in the FSAA system scan, which did not complete successfully. This failure was compounded by the configuration settings that skipped hosts that were offline, preventing the bulk import from executing.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by running a bulk import repair on the affected host. Additionally, changes were made to the bulk import configuration to allow for partial uploads and to not skip unresponsive hosts. This enabled the bulk import job to run successfully despite the FSAA system scan issues.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the FSAA system scan closely, especially when increasing the scan depth, as longer scan times may lead to timeouts.
- Consider removing decommissioned servers from the host list to avoid unnecessary errors during scans and imports.
- For future scheduling, it is advisable to run the AD Inventory job daily in the early morning to ensure that all jobs have the necessary data to execute properly.
