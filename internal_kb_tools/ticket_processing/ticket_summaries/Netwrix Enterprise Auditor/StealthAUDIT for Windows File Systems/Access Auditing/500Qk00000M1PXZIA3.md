- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000M1PXZIA3
- **Case Number:** 436172
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Lake Michigan Credit Union
- **Contact Name:** Alex Mata
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the File Server Activity was failing to import into the database, with the last scan recorded as 2021. The bulk import process was encountering an error stating, "Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data."

## Environment Details
- **Last Successful Scan:** 12/10/2021
- **Current Version of AIC:** 6.0.12
- **Current Version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor:** 11.5

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the FSAA scan had been disabled and had not run since 2021.
2. Set up a new schedule for the FSAA scan to run overnight.
3. Monitored the bulk import job for errors.
4. Ran the FSAA RESET maintenance task for the host.
5. Restarted the bulk import process.
6. Cleared Tier 2 database data to allow the bulk import to proceed.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the FSAA scans being disabled, which prevented any new data from being imported into the database since 2021. This led to a mismatch between the Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Enabling the FSAA scan and scheduling it to run regularly.
- Clearing the Tier 2 database data to allow the bulk import to proceed without errors.
- Monitoring the bulk import job to ensure it completed successfully and that the AIC console updated with the correct information.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that FSAA scans are enabled and scheduled to run regularly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the bulk import process encounters errors, check for database mismatches and consider running maintenance tasks as needed.
- The case can be reopened if any related issues arise after the import process is resumed.
