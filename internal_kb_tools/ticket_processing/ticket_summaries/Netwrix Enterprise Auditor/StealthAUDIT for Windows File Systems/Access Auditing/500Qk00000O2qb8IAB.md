## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving the error message "The operation has timed out" on all permission scans. The scans had previously worked without issues on the preceding Friday.

## Environment Details

- No changes were made to the environment between the last successful scan and the occurrence of the timeout error.

## Troubleshooting Steps

3. The support team requested additional information to streamline troubleshooting, including enabling debug logging and providing logs from various locations.
4. The customer rebooted the Access Analyzer server as a troubleshooting step.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The issue was resolved by rebooting the Access Analyzer server. This action restored proper communication, allowing permission scans to function correctly again.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the system for any recurrence of the issue. If the problem arises again, reviewing event logs and any third-party applications that could interfere with the process or traffic is recommended.
- Ensure that regular maintenance and monitoring of server health are conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.
