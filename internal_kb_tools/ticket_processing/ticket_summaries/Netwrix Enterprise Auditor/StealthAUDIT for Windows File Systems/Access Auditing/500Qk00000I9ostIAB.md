## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I9ostIAB
- **Case Number:** 426677
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Baldwin Risk Partners
- **Contact Name:** Ryan Oleary
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that Access Control Lists (ACLs) were not listed for synced resources when creating a review in the Access Information Center (AIC).

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 86

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial assessment of the permission scan and scheduling conflicts.
2. Reviewed error messages related to the FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import, specifically:
   ```
   code = Constraint (19), message = System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException (0x800027AF): constraint failed
   UNIQUE constraint failed: TBL_FSAA_ResourceMap.AccessID
   ```
3. Identified that the permission scan was scheduled to run simultaneously with the Active Directory Import (ADI) scan, which could cause database locking issues.
4. Changed the schedule to prevent overlapping scans.
5. Manually executed the permission scan after adjusting the schedule.
6. Ran the "Reset Hosts" option from FSAA > Query Settings > Maintenance > Reset Hosts to clear any existing constraints.
7. Verified that shares and ACLs were repopulated in the AIC.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by simultaneous execution of the FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import, which led to database locking and UNIQUE constraint violations in the SQLite database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Dropping all FSAA data and performing a complete rescan.
- Restructuring the job schedule to ensure that FS jobs do not overlap, preventing database locking issues in the future.
- Running the "Reset Hosts" option to clear any existing constraints that were causing the ACLs not to display.

## Notes
- Ensure that no two scans of the same type are scheduled to run against the same host simultaneously, as this can lead to database locking issues.
- Regularly review and adjust job schedules to prevent overlaps, especially when dealing with bulk imports and scans.
- Monitor for any error messages during scans and imports to address issues proactively.
