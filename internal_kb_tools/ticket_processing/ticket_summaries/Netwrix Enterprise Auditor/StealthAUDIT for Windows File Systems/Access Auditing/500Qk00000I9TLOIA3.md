## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000I9TLOIA3
- **Case Number:** 426647
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Freedom Mortgage
- **Contact Name:** David Grom
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
After upgrading to version 11.6, multiple FSAA scans were reported as "Running" with zero duration, indicating they had not started scanning. Initially, six servers were affected, but after clearing the `running.lck` file, only three servers remained in the "Running" status.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Servers:** 
  - AM-PBRFS-S121
  - ML-PI3RCRD-S121
  - SHQFL001
- **Previous Scan Duration:** One SEEK scan had been running for 27 days.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Cleared the `running.lck` file from the job's folder and restarted the job.
2. Investigated similarities between the affected servers (e.g., OS version, network configuration).
3. Confirmed that the job was set to Debug mode.
4. Exported the job configuration and logs for further analysis.
5. Monitored the bulk import statistics to check for any errors or issues.
6. Ran a test scan on ML-P13RCRD-S121, which completed successfully.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was attributed to scheduling conflicts caused by overlapping jobs, which led to the scans being reported as "Running" without actual execution. It was later determined that the scans were completing and uploading data, but the user interface was not reflecting this correctly, indicating a potential UI issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing the `running.lck` files for the scans that were stuck in the "Running" status.
- Confirming that the scans were indeed completing and bulk importing data, despite the UI not updating correctly.
- Advising the client to wait for the ongoing SEEK scan to finish before reinitiating the FSAA scans.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for overlapping job schedules to prevent similar issues in the future.
- If scans appear stuck, check for `running.lck` files and consider the possibility of UI discrepancies.
- Ensure that the system resources are not being heavily utilized by other processes (e.g., backups) during scan operations.
