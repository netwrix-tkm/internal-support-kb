## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IMTM0IAP
- **Case Number:** 427208
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ANZ
- **Contact Name:** Ritwij Raj
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.0.1232.1297

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Bulk Import job for the SG NAS was failing with a timeout error. The issue persisted despite previous successful configurations.

## Environment Details
- **Scanned Host:** SVRSG001SIN0002.GLOBALANZ.COM
- **Proxy with Tier 2 DBs:** APPSG001SIN0012
- **NEA Version:** 11.0.1232.1297

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation:**
   - Confirmed the Bulk Import job was the 2_FSAA job.
   - Verified that the configuration had previously worked without issues.
   - Checked for any changes on the server or NAS side, which were reported as none.

2. **Log Analysis:**
   - Enabled debug logging and collected logs for analysis.
   - Identified a consistent timeout occurring approximately 3 seconds after the import action began.

3. **Repair Attempt:**
   - Attempted to run a "Repair" job for the SVRSG001SIN0002 host via the File System data collector.
   - The repair operation failed due to a lack of disk space on the drive where the NEA database was stored.

4. **Further Investigation:**
   - Customer reset the host and attempted to restart the FSAA and FSAC syncs from scratch, but the timeout error persisted.
   - Discovered that the StealthAuditRPC.exe process was hanging on the proxy, which was terminated.

5. **Job Execution:**
   - After ending the hanging process, a new Bulk Import was attempted but failed with a different error: "SQL exception. No table found."
   - Customer was advised to reset the host again and restart the Full FSAA scan.

6. **Database Cleanup:**
   - Dropped all tables related to the SVRSG001SIN0002 host from the main StealthAudit database.
   - Removed local Tier 2 databases from both the StealthAudit console server and the proxy.
   - Re-created the SQL DB schema for the SVRSG001SIN0002 host and started a new FSAA scan.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a timeout error occurring during the Bulk Import process, which was exacerbated by a lack of disk space on the database drive. Additionally, the job received an abort request, likely due to the console being closed after starting the job manually.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing the following steps:
1. Dropping all tables related to the affected host from the StealthAudit database.
2. Removing local Tier 2 databases from the console and proxy.
3. Re-creating the SQL DB schema for the host.
4. Running a new FSAA scan, which allowed the Bulk Import job to complete successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the console remains open while running jobs manually to prevent unintended aborts.
- Monitor disk space on the database drive to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check for hanging processes like StealthAuditRPC.exe on the proxy to maintain system performance.
