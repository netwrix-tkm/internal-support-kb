- **Case Number:** 434358
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MUFG Bank, LTD.
- **Contact Name:** Michael Kong
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a `SystemIndexOutOfRange` error occurring when running FSAC scans, which caused the scans to end abruptly without any clear error messages.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) environment.
- The customer experienced resource-related issues, as other scans and tasks were struggling to start or run concurrently.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation:**
   - Noted that the `IndexOutOfRange` exception was being thrown during FSAA scans.
   - Suspected resource limitations due to multiple jobs running simultaneously.

2. **Suggested Plan Execution:**
   - Uninstalled the NEA console server.
   - Rebooted the console server.
   - Reinstalled NEA to a new directory.
   - Ran the upgrade mode after reinstallation.
   - Enabled debug logging.
   - Started FSAA scans to monitor for issues.

3. **Further Analysis:**
   - Increased the nested level on FSAA scans, which caused jobs to stop without finishing.
   - Reduced concurrent worker threads on failing jobs as a potential fix.

4. **Database Maintenance:**
   - Cleared the T2 database and rescanned to check if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration related to the Netwrix server, compounded by resource limitations when multiple jobs were executed simultaneously.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Clearing the T2 database, which allowed the FSAC scan to run successfully without encountering the `SystemIndexOutOfRange` error.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor resource usage when running multiple scans or jobs concurrently to avoid similar issues in the future.
- If the error persists after performing the above steps, consider collecting detailed logs (Windows Event Application Log, NEA logs, FSAA Job logs, etc.) for further analysis and potential escalation.
