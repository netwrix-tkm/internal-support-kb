- **Case Number:** 434073
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Post Holdings, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Justin Cahill
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6.0.127

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where they were unable to start scheduled scans using two new proxies. The error message indicated that the scan session could not be initialized with any proxy host supplied. The scans worked when executed manually from the console, but failed when scheduled.

## Environment Details
- **FSAA Proxy Version:** 11.6.0.37
- **NEA Version:** 11.6.0.127
- All components are within the same domain and use the same service account, which has local admin and domain admin privileges on the proxy.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the scheduled account had permissions to the proxy server.
2. Attempted to run the job with different connection profiles, including using both the Infrastructure (INF) account as Task(domain) and the File Service (FS) account as Active Directory.
3. Cleared existing certificates on the proxy and attempted to re-run the job.
4. Reviewed logs for errors related to certificate exchange and authentication.
5. Confirmed that the issue was not present in older proxies set up prior to the upgrade from version 11.6.0.35.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a result of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ignoring the scheduled task account and instead attempting to apply the certificate using the job's properties account. This behavior led to failures in establishing a secure stream for certificate exchange, resulting in the error "invalid principal name."

## Solution
The customer found a workaround by assigning the Infrastructure account in the job's properties, which allowed the necessary certificates to be laid down. After the certificates were established, the job continued to work even when reverting to the original configuration. This workaround was successfully applied to all three new proxies experiencing the issue.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that both the Task(domain) credential and the Active Directory credential are configured in the connection profile for new proxies to facilitate proper certificate exchange.
- Documentation may need to be updated to clarify the requirements for using Task(domain) credentials in proxy/file system scanning to avoid future confusion.
- The behavior of using different credentials for certificate exchange when running jobs manually versus scheduled tasks should be clearly documented to assist users in understanding the configuration requirements.
