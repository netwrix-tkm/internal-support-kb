- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Columbia University
- **Contact Name:** Iurii Druchuk
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested guidance on how to safely delete FSAA (File System Access Auditing) data for multiple hosts in bulk while preserving SDD (Scan Data) scan data.

## Environment Details
- The customer is not currently collecting FSAC (File System Activity) data.
- They are using a custom script to omit workstations from broken inheritance scans.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the customer does not have FSAC data and should be able to drop the desired hosts according to the knowledge base article for decommissioned FS hosts.
2. Discussed the implications of deleting FSAA data while wanting to retain SDD scan data.
3. Reviewed the customer's licensing to determine if FSAC is included.
4. Suggested using custom SQL scripts to manage the deletion of FSAA data while preserving SDD data.
5. Provided documentation and links to relevant knowledge base articles for further reference.

## Root Cause
The issue arose from the customer's requirement to delete FSAA data without affecting SDD scan data. The standard decommissioning process would delete all associated data, which was not acceptable for their use case.

## Solution
The resolution involved advising the customer that they would likely need to continue using custom SQL scripts to selectively delete FSAA data while preserving SDD data. It was also confirmed that their current license includes FSAC, and they could set it up in the future.

## Notes
- The Access Information Center relies on FSAA data; if FSAA data is deleted, no other data for that file server will be visible.
- The customer expressed a desire to avoid custom SQL queries in their configurations, but it appears necessary for their specific requirements.
- Future implementation of FSAC auditing will require a separate support ticket.
- NetApp ONTAP is supported, but the collection process differs from Windows File Servers, requiring an agent on a proxy server.
