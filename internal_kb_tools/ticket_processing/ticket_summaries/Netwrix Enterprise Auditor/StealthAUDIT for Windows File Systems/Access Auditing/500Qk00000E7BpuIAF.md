- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems

## Problem Description
The customer reported that filesystem scans were failing with the error message indicating an inability to initialize the scan session with any proxy host supplied. 

## Environment Details

- **Filesystem Proxy Version:** 11.6.0.28
- **Error Message:** 
  ```
  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the required permissions were assigned to the Windows host and Proxy server as per documentation.
2. Ensured that the necessary ports were open for communication.
3. Deleted certificates as per the knowledge base article: [Netwrix KB Article](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000WSvKAM.html).
4. Identified a version mismatch between the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Filesystem Proxy.
5. Recommended the customer update to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to rule out compatibility issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a version mismatch between the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Filesystem Proxy, which prevented the initialization of the scan session.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by updating both the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Filesystem Proxy to compatible versions. After the updates, the customer deleted the existing certificates as per the knowledge base instructions, which allowed the scan sessions to initialize successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that both the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Filesystem Proxy are kept up to date to avoid compatibility issues.
- Always verify that the necessary permissions and network configurations are in place before initiating scans.
- Refer to the Netwrix knowledge base for guidance on certificate management and troubleshooting steps for similar issues.
