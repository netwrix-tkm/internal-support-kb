## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E0DwUIAV
- **Case Number:** 416997
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Westpac Banking Corporation
- **Contact Name:** Mark Chambers
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer inquired about StealthAUDIT's capability to detect network shares that have open resources, specifically questioning whether it reports on the "List Folder Contents" permission assigned to various user groups.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6 of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was used for testing.
- **Permissions in Question:** NTFS permissions for groups such as Authenticated Users, Everyone, Users, and Domain Users.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the StealthAUDIT reporting capabilities regarding open shares.
2. Conducted tests to verify if "List Folder Contents" permissions were recognized in the OpenResources results.
3. Confirmed the configuration of permissions for the specified groups.

## Root Cause
StealthAUDIT does not recognize a folder as having open access if only "List Folder Contents" permissions are assigned to it. This behavior is by design and not a bug in the permissions scanning feature.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by clarifying that StealthAUDIT will not report a folder as an open share if it only has "List Folder Contents" permissions assigned to groups like Everyone. This was confirmed through testing with version 11.6 of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Notes
- It is important to inform customers that "List Folder Contents" alone does not constitute an open share in StealthAUDIT's reporting.
- Future inquiries regarding permissions should clarify the specific permissions being assigned to avoid confusion about what is reported as open access.
