## Problem Description
The customer reported a certificate validation error during an FSAA Win Scan, specifically stating: "Failed to validate certificate from a0775-app2356-s: Friendly Name = , Thumbprint = FFF7A65C2E1A509E25DCE45D4F6F4958996DC894".

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred on multiple Enterprise Auditor servers.
- The FSAA scan was configured to run as a service.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the environment and jobs related to the FSAA scan.
2. Executed the following PowerShell command to check for the certificate:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy | Where-Object { $_.Thumbprint -eq "YOUR_THUMBPRINT_HERE" }
   ```
3. Confirmed that the certificate with the specified thumbprint did not exist on the affected machines.
4. Checked a working machine and noted that there was a certificate in a store that was inaccessible.
5. Advised the customer to contact their Security Team for a valid .pfx file to be used in the FSAA query properties.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration of the FSAA Applet startup type, which was set to "Require FSAA applet running as a service". This configuration prevented the scan from executing properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the FSAA Applet startup type from "Require FSAA applet running as a service" to "MS Task Scheduler". After making this change, individual target hosts were added to the FSAA scan job, and both the FSAA permission scan job and the Bulk Import job completed successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that the correct certificate is installed and accessible on all machines where the FSAA scan is executed.
- For future cases, verify the FSAA Applet configuration settings to avoid similar issues.
- It is recommended to maintain clear communication with the Security Team regarding certificate management to prevent validation errors.
