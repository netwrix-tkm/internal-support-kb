- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported receiving a `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` error when attempting to run permissions and SDD scans, specifically stating: "There is no row at position 0."

## Environment Details
- The issue was encountered while running FSAA/SEEK System Scans from specific hosts.
- The error was reproducible on certain hosts, indicating a potential network or configuration issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Conducted a test scan using the proxy server to the host `OTTVAIOHUGMS001`.
2. Verified connectivity on port 445 from the proxy to the host, which was unsuccessful.
3. Checked for firewall logs on the Palo Alto firewall, which showed no hits (success or deny).
4. Upgraded to NEA version 11.6.0.117 and FS Proxy version 11.6.0.36.
5. Discussed the creation of a job to drop data for a file system host; the customer attempted to run the `DropFSTables` job.
6. Identified that the "Server" service must be running on target hosts for scans to succeed.
7. Confirmed that the error "Failed to connect to HUGVAPPLRSMS001IPC$: The specified network name is no longer available" occurred when the "Server" service was disabled.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the NEA scan server (proxy server) being unable to reach the target host's IPC$ share due to SMB traffic over port 445 being blocked by an internal firewall. This was compounded by the "Server" service not running on the target hosts.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following actions were recommended:
- Implement a firewall rule to allow SMB (TCP 445) traffic between the NEA scan server and the target file system.
- Ensure that the "Server" service is running on all target hosts.
- The customer was advised to work with their firewall team to open the necessary ports and confirm the configuration.

## Notes
- The customer must coordinate with Open Systems to locate the correct firewall blocking the connections and ensure that ports 445 are opened between the proxies and the target hosts.
- If the issue persists after the firewall rule has been applied, the ticket can be reopened within 30 days for further assistance.
