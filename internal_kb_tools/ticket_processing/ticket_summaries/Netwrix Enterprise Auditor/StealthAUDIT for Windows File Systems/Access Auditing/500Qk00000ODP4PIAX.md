## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with importing data related to the SA-FSA_Gates, specifically encountering a foreign key (FK) error on FSDFS_Links during a bulk import operation. The issue began on March 15, 2025, and affected the ability to import up-to-date data for the host USA-ANA-ENGRNT2.

## Environment Details
- Host: USA-ANA-ENGRNT2
- Software involved: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Restarted the proxy server.
2. Dropped T2 from the database.
3. Set the host to RESET.
4. Rescanned the data, which was successful.
5. Attempted bulk import, which failed with a foreign key error.
6. Collected logs and diagnostic information as requested by support.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a conflict between the data in the database and the data being scanned from the host. Specifically, there were inconsistencies that led to foreign key errors during the import process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Dropping the host data for USA-ANA-ENGRNT2 from the database.
2. Restarting the bulk import scan, which subsequently succeeded.
3. Identifying that the errors in the FSAA scan were related to a listening port issue, where responses on port 8766 failed until the proxy server was rebooted.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the responses on port 8766, as they may fail until the proxy server is restarted.
- For future reference, if similar issues arise, ensure to check for conflicts in the database and consider clearing old data before attempting imports.
- If the FSAA scan fails again, run the following commands to diagnose the issue:
  ```bash
  netstat -aof | findstr :8766
  tnc -computername <proxyserverIP> -port 8766
  ```
- Follow up on the results of the bulk import job to confirm successful completion.
