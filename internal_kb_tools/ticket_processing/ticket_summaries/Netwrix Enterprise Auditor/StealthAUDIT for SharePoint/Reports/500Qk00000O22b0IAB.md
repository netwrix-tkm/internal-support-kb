- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000O22b0IAB
- **Case Number:** 441919
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported high CPU usage (100% on and off) during the execution of the SharePoint Broken Inheritance Job on server A0775-APP2357-S, which utilizes SQL database A0775-DBS0136-S. The DBA requested that the query be rewritten to optimize processing power and prevent server outages.

## Environment Details
- **SQL Database:** A0775-DBS0136-S
- **Server:** A0775-APP2357-S
- **Related Database:** J4D_STEALTHAUDIT_AEM_SP
- **Previous Issues:** Multiple tickets opened over the last 6 months regarding similar performance issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the query causing high CPU usage, specifically the `SELECT...INTO` statement.
2. Suggested creating temporary tables before inserting data to optimize performance.
3. Advised the DBA team to create an unnamed primary key on the temporary tables for faster processing.
4. Conducted a meeting with the customer to discuss potential improvements and safe testing procedures.
5. Recommended enabling debug logging and collecting logs from various locations for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The high CPU usage was primarily caused by the inefficient use of the `SELECT...INTO` statement, which was inserting data into temporary tables without prior creation and indexing, leading to increased processing power requirements.

## Solution
The customer was guided to:
1. Make a copy of the job for backup purposes.
2. Rename the copy for testing (e.g., appending `_DBA_Test`).
3. Modify the query to create temporary tables before inserting data.
4. Implement the suggested changes and run the modified job to assess performance improvements.

The support team endorsed testing improvements in a controlled manner, ensuring that backups were available to revert if necessary.

## Notes
- It is crucial to create temporary tables before inserting data to optimize performance and reduce CPU load.
- Always ensure that backups of original jobs are maintained before making any modifications.
- Monitor CPU usage and performance after implementing changes to identify further optimization opportunities.
