- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the `SP_ProbableOwners` job was not completing successfully, resulting in an error related to insufficient space in the `tempdb` database.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Error Message:** 
  ```
  ERROR DataAnalysis:SQLScripting ExecuteNonQuery "Could not allocate space for object 'dbo.SORT temporary run storage:  140746754686976' in database 'tempdb' because the 'PRIMARY' filegroup is full. Create disk space by deleting unneeded files, dropping objects in the filegroup, adding additional files to the filegroup, or setting autogrowth on for existing files in the filegroup."
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to run the `SP_ProbableOwners` job.
2. Received the error message indicating that the `tempdb` filegroup was full.
3. Investigated the configuration of the `tempdb` database to check for autogrowth settings and available disk space.
4. Reviewed the status of ongoing SPO scans that were necessary for the report.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `tempdb` database being full, which prevented the `SP_ProbableOwners` job from allocating the necessary space for its operations. This was exacerbated by issues with the SP System Scan and Bulk import processes, leading to inaccuracies in the report.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Ensuring that the `tempdb` had sufficient disk space by either deleting unneeded files or adjusting the autogrowth settings for the database files.
- Addressing the underlying issues with the SP System Scan and Bulk import processes that contributed to the report inaccuracies.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the `tempdb` space regularly and configure autogrowth settings appropriately to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Future troubleshooting should consider the status of SPO collections and scans, as they may impact the performance and accuracy of reports generated by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
