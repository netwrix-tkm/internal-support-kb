## Problem Description
The customer requested a report on access permissions provided through Active Directory (AD) groups, specifically to identify the usage of specific AD groups within on-premises and cloud applications in their environment.

## Environment Details
- The customer is utilizing Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.5.
- The inquiry pertains to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer solution.

## Root Cause

## Solution

2. A call was scheduled with the customer and stakeholders to finalize the requirements for the report.
3. Upon approval of the SOW and quotation by the customer, the Professional Services team began work on delivering the requested report.
