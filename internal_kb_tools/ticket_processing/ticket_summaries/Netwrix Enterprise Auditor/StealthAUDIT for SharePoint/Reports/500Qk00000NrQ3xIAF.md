- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Reports

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with the SharePoint job features, specifically that the Pivot analysis does not populate its corresponding table, despite the source table being populated. This resulted in missing data from the report.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.113
- The customer was using the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for SharePoint.

3. Suggested checking the source table for data to ensure it was populated.
4. Discussed the limitations of the Published Reports in retaining historical scan data.
5. Proposed a potential fix by increasing the character limit from 128 to 256 for the Pivot analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a limitation in the character field size for the Pivot analysis, which prevented it from properly populating the corresponding table.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by increasing the character limit for the relevant field from 128 to 256. This adjustment allowed the Pivot analysis to correctly populate its corresponding table, thus resolving the missing data issue in the report.

## Notes
- It is important for future cases to verify the character limits of fields used in reports, especially when dealing with data population issues.
- Customers should be informed about the limitations of Published Reports regarding data retention and the need for custom reports to track trends over time.
- Always ensure that the source tables contain the necessary data before troubleshooting report generation issues.
