## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K9KX9IAN
- **Case Number:** 431064
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Post Holdings, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Justin Cahill
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Database
- **Feature:** Bulk Import
- **Version:** 11.6.0.127

## Problem Description
After upgrading from version 11.6.0.112 to 11.6.0.127, the customer reported that SharePoint Online (SPO) bulk import jobs were failing due to SQL-related errors. The logs indicated issues with database connections, specifically stating that the connection's current state was closed.

## Environment Details
- **Current Versions:**
  - Netwrix Access Information Center: 11.6.0.32
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor: 7.1.241
  - Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit: 7.1.241
  - Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: 11.6.0.127
  - Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On: 11.6.0.15

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed error and event logs on the SQL server for any dropped connections.
2. Analyzed the attached bulk import job logs which were in DEBUG mode.
3. Confirmed that there were no apparent issues on the SQL server side that aligned with the bulk import errors.
4. Suggested checking SQL server resource allocation, particularly memory settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being related to SQL server memory configuration. The SQL server was set to use unlimited RAM, which led to performance issues and connection problems during bulk import operations.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by lowering the maximum RAM usage on the SQL server from unlimited to 75% of the server's total memory. After this adjustment, all bulk import jobs began to function correctly.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor SQL server resource allocation, especially after upgrades or changes in configuration.
- Future configurations should consider setting memory limits to prevent similar issues from occurring.
