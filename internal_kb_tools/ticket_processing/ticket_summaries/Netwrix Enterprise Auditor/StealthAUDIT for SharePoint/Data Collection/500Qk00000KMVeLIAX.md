## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KMVeLIAX
- **Case Number:** 431465
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a recurring issue with a Foreign Key Constraint Error occurring during a bulk import operation after dropping SharePoint (SP) data. The error had previously been documented in case 425496.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the recurrence of the Foreign Key Constraint Error after dropping SP data.
2. Identified that the workaround involved dropping SP data to temporarily resolve the issue.
3. Reviewed logs and previous cases for similar issues and potential fixes.
4. Investigated the state of the TempDB, noting that it had been filled with hundreds of millions of uncommitted transactions.
5. Discussed potential out-of-memory (OOM) errors on the SQL host due to multiple concurrent expensive queries.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a product defect related to the handling of Foreign Key constraints during bulk import operations. Additionally, the TempDB was filled with uncommitted transactions, which could have been exacerbated by OOM errors when multiple expensive queries were executed concurrently.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by addressing the uncommitted transactions in the TempDB, which improved its performance. However, the fix for the Foreign Key Constraint Error was not delivered before the expiration of the Proof of Concept (POC) license, which limited further verification of the solution.

## Notes
- The POC license expired before the fix could be verified, which may affect future testing and validation of the solution.
- It is recommended to monitor TempDB usage closely and manage uncommitted transactions to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider increasing the number of concurrent threads for SQL jobs to improve performance, but ensure that this does not lead to OOM errors.
