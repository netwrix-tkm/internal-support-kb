- **Case Number:** 417634
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the SPAA Bulk Import process, which was throwing a foreign key constraint error related to the Probable Owner analysis.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor platform, specifically using the StealthAUDIT for SharePoint component.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The development team was notified of the issue and escalated for further investigation.
2. A workaround was suggested to reset the USN value for the host site in the database.
3. The following SQL command was executed to modify the USN:
   ```sql
   UPDATE SA_SPAA_HOSTS
   SET USN = 0
   WHERE ID = 1;
   ```
4. After confirming that the USN was set to 0, the SPO Seek bulk import was attempted again.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the foreign key constraint error was not definitively identified during the investigation. However, it was noted that similar issues had been encountered previously, indicating a potential systemic problem with the bulk import process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by resetting the USN value for the SP host site to 0, which allowed the SPAA Bulk Import process to complete successfully. The command executed was:
```sql
UPDATE SA_SPAA_HOSTS
SET USN = 0
WHERE ID = 1;
```
After this modification, the bulk import was re-run without errors.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor for similar foreign key constraint errors in future bulk imports and consider implementing a more permanent fix once the root cause is identified.
- Ensure that any changes to the USN field are documented and communicated to relevant team members to avoid confusion in future troubleshooting efforts.
