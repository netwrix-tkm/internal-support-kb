## Problem Description
The customer reported slow performance during SharePoint Online SEEK system scans, with jobs hanging for extended periods and not completing as expected.

## Environment Details
- Customer has 3,799 SharePoint Online sites to scan.
- The last SEEK job started at 08:00 AM on 03.03.2025 and got stuck at 13:37 PM, showing "DLP finished" as the last log entry.
- The SDD module was running locally on the Stealth Audit server with specific settings:
  - Scanning a single site with a depth of 1.
  - Not processing files larger than 10 MB.
  - Using 7 concurrent SDD threads.
  - Scanning typical documents only.
  - Storing discovered sensitive data was enabled.
  - 32 sensitive data criteria were configured.
  - Agent service scan was disabled.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected memory dumps of the NEA console and the StealthAudit Job process.
2. Gathered debug logs from the SADatabase folder and exported SEEK scan job logs.
3. Killed the stuck job process, which then appeared as "Success" in the console.
4. Started a bulk import job while monitoring the situation.
5. Suggested the customer test SEEK scans with modified settings:
   - Not processing files larger than 2 MB.
   - Only using 2 concurrent SDD threads.
6. Escalated the issue to R&D for further analysis.
7. Monitored disk issues on the system level, noting occurrences every evening around 22:30-22:50.
8. Set up procdump to monitor the StealthAudit.exe process for crash dumps.
9. Conducted tests from a server outside of the DMZ, which completed scans in 15 minutes, indicating potential infrastructure issues.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as an infrastructure issue based on network packet analysis. The original server in the DMZ was causing delays, while a server outside the DMZ performed scans efficiently.

## Solution
The customer moved the NEA server to another host outside of the DMZ, which resolved the performance issues. Additionally, a hotfix was applied to resolve the bulk import issue by dropping SP tables.

## Notes
- It is crucial to monitor the network configuration and performance when dealing with large SharePoint Online environments.
- Ensure that antivirus exclusions are properly configured to avoid interference with scanning processes.
- Future scans should be tested from different hosts to rule out infrastructure-related issues.
