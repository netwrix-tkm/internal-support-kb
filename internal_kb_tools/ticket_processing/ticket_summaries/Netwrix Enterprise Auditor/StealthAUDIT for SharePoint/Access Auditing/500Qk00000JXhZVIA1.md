## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue while scanning a host on two servers (A0185-APP2750-S and Y0185-APP0443-S). An error occurred indicating that the `tempdb` database could not allocate space due to the primary filegroup being full, and the transaction log for `tempdb` was full due to an active transaction.

## Environment Details
- The servers are configured in alignment with vendor recommendations.
- The error message indicated issues with the `tempdb` database, specifically related to storage space and transaction log management.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message indicating that the `tempdb` was full due to lack of storage space.
2. Confirmed server configuration against vendor recommendations (details attached).
3. Reached out to the Database Administrator (DBA) for insights on the `tempdb` filling up despite the existing configuration.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified. However, it was suspected that multiple jobs running concurrently were filling up the SQL `tempdb`, leading to the reported errors.

## Solution
The issue resolved itself without direct intervention. It is likely that the concurrent jobs completed, freeing up space in the `tempdb`. No further action was required from the support team.

## Notes
- Monitor the number of concurrent jobs running on the SQL server to prevent future occurrences of `tempdb` filling up.
- Consider implementing alerts for `tempdb` space usage to proactively manage storage issues.
- Ensure that autogrowth settings for `tempdb` are configured appropriately to handle unexpected spikes in usage.
