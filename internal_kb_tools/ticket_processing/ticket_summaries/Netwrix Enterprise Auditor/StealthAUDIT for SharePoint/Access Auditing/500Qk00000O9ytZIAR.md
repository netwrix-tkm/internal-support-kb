- **Case Number:** 442427
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** St Margarets Hospice
- **Contact Name:** Liam Rice
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 12.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error while attempting to run the `RegisterAzureAppAuth` for SharePoint, receiving the following error messages:
```
Connect-MgGraph : The type initializer for 'Azure.Identity.AuthenticationRecord' threw an exception.
Could not connect to MS Graph API
```
The issue occurred despite having set up a connection account with the necessary credentials.

## Environment Details
- The task was targeted at a SharePoint Online Tenant.
- The connection account included a Global Admin Entra ID account.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer attempted to run the `RegisterAzureAppAuth` job, which failed with the specified error.
2. The support engineer suggested checking the application registration and Graph API permissions.
3. The customer was advised to manually configure the application for SharePoint Online access auditing by following the provided documentation links.
4. The customer attempted to configure the Entra ID app for SharePoint online access auditing manually.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as being caused by an incorrect connection profile configuration, which led to the failure in connecting to the Microsoft Graph API.

## Solution
The customer found a workaround by using PowerShell to connect to Microsoft Graph API with the command:
```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -TenantId $tenantId
```
By keeping the PowerShell session open, the customer was able to pre-authenticate using the same user that was registered in the system. This allowed the registration of the app to proceed successfully, despite still encountering an error during a subsequent checking stage.

## Notes
- Ensure that the application is properly registered with the necessary Graph API permissions before attempting to run the `RegisterAzureAppAuth`.
- If similar issues arise, consider using PowerShell to establish a connection to Microsoft Graph API as a potential workaround.
- Document any errors encountered during the app registration process for future reference and troubleshooting.
