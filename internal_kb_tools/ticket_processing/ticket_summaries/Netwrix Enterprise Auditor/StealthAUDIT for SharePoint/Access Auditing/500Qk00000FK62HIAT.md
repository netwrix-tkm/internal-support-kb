## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FK62HIAT
- **Case Number:** 420025
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Micron Technology, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Travis Price
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that SPAA scans were not completing gracefully after finishing. Instead, the scans would hang until the job timeout was reached, at which point they could be bulk imported. The scans were scoped, and the customer was unsure if this had any impact on the issue.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.90
- **Issue Type:** Third-party system failure

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer was advised to check for any anti-virus interference as a potential cause.
2. Suggested performing a repair installation of the software.
3. Recommended checking for the latest cumulative updates (CU) and applying them.
4. Inquired whether the issue occurred on every run or was intermittent.
5. Asked if the issue occurred only during scheduled runs or also during interactive runs.
6. Investigated if other jobs were running concurrently that could cause conflicts.
7. Checked for table locks or deadlocks in SQL logs.
8. Attempted to gather core logs and ProcDump when the job hung for further analysis.

## Root Cause
The root cause was identified as potential interference from the customer's anti-virus software, which was suspected to be causing the SPAA scans to hang.

## Solution
The customer was advised to investigate their anti-virus settings and configurations. They agreed to test this solution and would reopen the ticket if the issue persisted after making adjustments.

## Notes
- The customer was unwilling to share the entire SPAA log due to confidentiality concerns but was open to discussing logs in a call if necessary.
- It is important to consider third-party software interactions, such as anti-virus programs, when troubleshooting similar issues.
- Future support cases should emphasize the importance of obtaining relevant logs while respecting customer confidentiality.
