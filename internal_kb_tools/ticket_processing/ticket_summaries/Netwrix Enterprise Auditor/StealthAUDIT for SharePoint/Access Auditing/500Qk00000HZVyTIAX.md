## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HZVyTIAX
- **Case Number:** 425267
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Fidelity Assurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Calvin Minnick
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during a bulk import operation, specifically a conflict with a foreign key constraint in the database. The error message indicated that the MERGE statement could not be executed due to a foreign key constraint violation related to the "FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId".

## Environment Details
- Database: StealthauditDB
- Table: dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources
- Previous hotfix applied on 1/30/2025.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation**: Reviewed the error message and identified the foreign key constraint issue.
2. **DLL Error Resolution**: Found a DLL error from the last hotfix. Unblocked all SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder dated 01/30/2025 and initiated a new SPAC System Scan.
3. **USN Value Check**: Investigated the SP Bulk Import error with development, discovering that the USN was significantly higher than expected.
4. **Development Engagement**: Engaged with the development team for a fix, which was expected to be delivered the following week.
5. **Hotfix Deployment**: Deployed the code fix by upgrading to NEA v11.6.0.138 and reset the USN value to 0 on the SPAA_Hosts table for the SPO host.
6. **Final Testing**: Conducted final testing of the SPAA Bulk Import and SPAC System Scan to confirm resolution.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a foreign key constraint violation due to an unexpectedly high USN value in the database, compounded by DLL errors from a previous hotfix.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Upgrading to NEA version 11.6.0.138, which included a fix for the foreign key constraint issue.
- Resetting the USN value to 0 on the SPAA_Hosts table.
- Successfully running the SPAA Bulk Import and SPAC System Scan without further errors.

## Notes
- The customer experienced some minor errors on individual resources during the import, which were deemed normal and related to new event types added by SharePoint.
- A separate ticket was created to address the addition of the new event type to the SharePoint activity mappings.
- Ensure to monitor for any similar foreign key constraint issues in future bulk imports and maintain communication with development for timely fixes.
