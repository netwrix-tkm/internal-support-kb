## Problem Description
The customer reported an authentication error when attempting to use the Azure App for a SharePoint job after uploading a new certificate. The error message indicated a configuration issue preventing authentication.

## Environment Details

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error message and documentation links provided in the error for guidance.
2. Suggested checking the Azure Portal and MS Graph to verify the configured keys for the application.
3. Advised the customer to recreate the Azure app due to suspected misconfiguration.
4. Confirmed that the connection profile credential password needed to be updated to reflect the new thumbprint.

## Root Cause
The Azure app was not configured correctly after the new certificate was uploaded, leading to the authentication failure.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by having the customer recreate the Azure app with the correct configuration. After reconfiguring the Azure app, the authentication error was eliminated, allowing the SharePoint job to function as intended.

## Notes
- Ensure that any new certificates uploaded to Azure apps are properly registered and configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify that the connection profile credentials are updated to reflect any changes in the certificate thumbprint.
