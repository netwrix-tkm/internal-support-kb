## Problem Description
The customer, Bill Brunt from Novacoast, reported an issue with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor where he was unable to create a SharePoint Online application connection. The error message indicated a failure in creating a token request, suggesting a configuration issue.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Version:** 11.6.0.72
- **SharePoint Environment:** SharePoint Online
- **Date of Issue:** July 10, 2024

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Configuration Review:** The customer followed the provided documentation for configuring SharePoint Online.
2. **PowerShell Output:** The customer provided the output from a PowerShell script detailing installed versions of Netwrix products.
3. **Documentation Feedback:** The support team reviewed the documentation and identified discrepancies regarding the host URL.
4. **Job Execution:** The customer attempted to run the SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth job to set up the Azure app registration.
5. **Error Analysis:** The customer noted multiple error icons in the collection job folder, indicating issues with INI files and warnings treated as errors.
6. **Parameter Adjustment:** The customer changed the `$appName` parameter to "newapp" and retried the job.

## Root Cause
The primary cause of the issue was an incorrect host URL configuration. The documentation incorrectly specified the host as “M365X41559705.ONMICROSOFT.COM” instead of the correct “M365X41559705.SHAREPOINT.COM.” This misconfiguration likely led to the failure in creating the application token.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
1. Correcting the host URL in the configuration to “M365X41559705.SHAREPOINT.COM.”
2. Utilizing the SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth job, which is the recommended method for setting up Azure app registrations for SharePoint Online.
3. The customer was advised to ensure that the new application password (key) was noted for future reference.

## Notes
- The customer noted that the documentation should clarify the correct host URL and include the SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth job in the SharePoint Online setup guide.
- It was suggested that similar jobs for Exchange Online and AzureAD/Entra ID should also be documented for better clarity.
- The customer was encouraged to provide feedback on the documentation to expedite updates.
