- **Account/Company:** State of South Dakota
- **Contact Name:** Devon Anderson

## Problem Description
The customer, State of South Dakota, reported an issue with collecting SharePoint Online (SPO) activity due to unknown event types being logged. This resulted in missed activity events, which could impact long-term storage and insights into certain activities.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6.0.138
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.138
- **Issue Start Date:** May 6, 2025 (exact start date uncertain)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. In Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.6.0.138, run the job for SharePoint.
2. Navigate to "0.Collection" > "3-SPAC_SystemScans".
3. Right-click the "3-SPAC_SystemsScans" job and select "Explore Folder".
4. Retrieve and review the "3-SPAC_SystemScans_Log.tsv" log.
5. Search for "Unknown event type" in the log to identify the unknown event types.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by Microsoft adding new event types or changing existing ones in SharePoint Online, which were not mapped in the Netwrix system. This is a common occurrence that requires the development team to update the mappings to include these new event types.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing a hotfix (version 11.6.0.078) that included the following new event types:
- ListItemApprovalCreated
- ListItemApprovalApproved
- FileMediaThumbnailSetDeleted
- FileTranscriptPropertiesEdited
- CustomThumbnailUploaded
- SharingLinkDeleted
- CommentDeleted
- UserExpirationChanged
- DLPRuleMatch
- FileTranscriptContentEdited

The hotfix was made available for download and successfully applied to the customer's environment.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor for new event types added by Microsoft in SharePoint Online, as they may require updates to the Netwrix mappings.
- Future cases involving unknown event types should be escalated to the development team for mapping updates as part of standard procedure.
