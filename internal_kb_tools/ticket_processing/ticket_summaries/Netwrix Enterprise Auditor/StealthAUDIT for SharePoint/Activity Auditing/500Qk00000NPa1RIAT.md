## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NPa1RIAT
- **Case Number:** 440261
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** American Fidelity Assurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Calvin Minnick
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a warning message indicating an unknown event type, `FileTranscriptContentEdited`, during the execution of a SharePoint Online activity scan. The warning suggested adding this event type to the SharePointOnlineEventTypeMappings in the SharePointActivityMappings.xml file.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** SharePoint Online
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Build Number:** 0.138

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected the `FileTranscriptContentEdited` event via NAM (Netwrix Activity Monitor).
2. Ran the FSAC (File Share Activity Collector) System Scan.
3. Observed the warning about the unknown event type.

## Root Cause
The `FileTranscriptContentEdited` event type was not included in the existing SharePoint activity mappings, which led to the warning message during the system scan.

## Solution
A hotfix was released that included the new event type `FileTranscriptContentEdited` along with several other new event types. The hotfix version 11.0.6.078 was installed, which resolved the issue by updating the SharePoint activity mappings to recognize the new event type.

## Notes
- Ensure that any new event types are communicated to the development team for inclusion in future updates.
