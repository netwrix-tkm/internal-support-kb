## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000IGSUIIA5
- **Case Number:** 426956
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Vertiv
- **Contact Name:** George Petkus
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during SharePoint Online (SPO) activity scans, specifically encountering messages indicating issues with retrieving the INI file path from the registry and a failure in preparing the task for the system scan.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the configuration of the SharePoint Online tenant in Netwrix Activity Monitor.
2. Checked the SPAC log for error messages related to log location and registry settings.
3. Attempted to run the SPO job and scanned for errors, including warnings about local SID prefix resolution.
4. Discussed potential configuration issues with the Activity Logs settings.
5. Reviewed documentation for setting up SPO Activity auditing.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the Activity Logs section of the query settings, which prevented the system from locating the necessary logs for SharePoint Online. Additionally, the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) version 11.5 did not have the updated SP Event XML to resolve new event IDs, leading to warnings about missing event types.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that the SPAC job was properly configured to locate the activity logs for SharePoint Online. Upgrading to NEA version 11.6 corrected the warnings regarding missing/unknown event IDs, as this version included mappings for newer event types collected by the Activity Monitor.

## Notes
- Ensure that the SPAC job configuration is regularly reviewed to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider upgrading to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to benefit from updated event mappings and improved functionality.
- For detailed configuration guidance, refer to the Netwrix documentation on setting up SharePoint Online Activity auditing.
