## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000NGVU7IAP
- **Case Number:** 439782
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Medpace, Inc
- **Contact Name:** Brittany Lac
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6.0.138

## Problem Description
After initiating the SPAC System Scan for SharePoint Online (SPO), the customer encountered an "Invalid URI: The format of the URI could not be determined" error. This issue arose following an upgrade to NEA version 11.6.0.138. While data was being successfully collected by NAM, NEA was unable to ingest it.

## Environment Details
- **Upgrade Version:** NEA v11.6.0.138
- **Data Collection Tool:** NAM (Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected data successfully from SPO in NAM.
2. Ran SPAC System Scan against the same NAM monitored SPO host.
3. Observed job failure within 10 minutes with no data ingested.
4. Investigated logs and identified that the issue began post-upgrade.
5. Attempted SQL fixes on the SPAC.db3 database using DB Browser for SQLite:
   - Executed SQL code to update URLs in the ActivitySiteCollections table.
   - Verified that no URLs were missing the 'http' prefix.
6. Reran the SPAC System Scan and Bulk Import after applying the SQL updates.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incorrect URL formats in the ActivitySiteCollections table of the SPAC database. These incorrect values originated from the SPAA database during data migration, which occurs when upgrading from versions lower than 11.6.0.138.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Opened the SPAC.db3 database with DB Browser for SQLite.
2. Executed the following SQL commands to correct the URL formats:
   ```sql
   UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace-my.sharepoint.com/personal/', SUBSTR(URL,11,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,11,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/personal/%';
   UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/sites/', SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/sites/%';
   UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/teams/', SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/teams/%';
   ```
3. Ran a SELECT query to ensure no URLs were missing the 'http' prefix:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ActivitySiteCollections WHERE URL NOT LIKE 'http%';
   ```
4. Hit "Write Changes" in DB Browser to save the modifications.
5. Reran the SPAC System Scan and confirmed successful data ingestion.

## Notes
- Ensure to always save changes in DB Browser for SQLite after executing SQL commands to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor for any similar URI errors post-upgrade, especially when migrating data from older versions.
- It is advisable to back up the SPAC database before performing any SQL updates.
