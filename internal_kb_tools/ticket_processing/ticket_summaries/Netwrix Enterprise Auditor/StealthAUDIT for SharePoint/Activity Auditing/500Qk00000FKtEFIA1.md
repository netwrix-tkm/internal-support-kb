- **Case Number:** 420048
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Point32Health Services, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Peter Sterianos
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for SharePoint
- **Feature:** Activity Auditing
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error during the SPAC Bulk Import process, indicating a conflict with a foreign key constraint in the database. The specific error message was related to the inability to perform a bulk import due to a MERGE statement conflict.

## Environment Details
- **Database:** StealthAudit
- **Error Message:** 
  ```
  ERROR SHAREPOINTACCESS Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute "[C:8] Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_SA_SPAC_GroupMembershipChanges_HOST_ID". The conflict occurred in database "StealthAudit", table "dbo.SA_SPAC_ActivityEvents". The statement has been terminated."
  ```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Investigated the foreign key constraint and table relationships.
2. Attempted to update the USN value of the host in the SPAA_Hosts table using the SQL command:
   ```sql
   UPDATE dbo.SA_SPAA_Hosts SET USN = 0
   ```
3. Reran the SPAC Bulk Import job, which failed again with the same error.
4. Removed all SPAA and SPAC tables from the database due to a 180-day retention period on SP activity.
5. Reran the SPSEEK jobs to verify that the tables were repopulated in the database.
6. Monitored the SPAC Bulk Import job after the scans.

## Root Cause
The SPAC Bulk Import failure was caused by a foreign key constraint conflict between the `SP_SPAC_GroupMembershipChanges` table and the `SA_SPAC_ActivityEvents` table, which prevented the successful execution of the MERGE statement.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by removing all SPAA and SPAC tables from the database, allowing the SPSEEK jobs to run and repopulate the necessary tables. After these steps, the SPAC Bulk Import job was successfully executed without errors.

## Notes
- It is recommended to monitor the SPAC Bulk Import job after performing similar operations in the future.
- Ensure that any foreign key constraints are reviewed and understood before performing bulk operations to avoid conflicts.
- Consider the 180-day retention period for SP activity when managing SPAA and SPAC tables.
