- **Case Number:** 433160
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motiva Enterprises
- **Contact Name:** James Rigoulot
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for AzureAD
- **Feature:** Inventory
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
All Entra collection jobs in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (EA) are failing, with similar failures reported in Threat Manager. The error messages indicate issues with database connectivity and execution.

## Environment Details
- The client has had Entra jobs enabled since implementation but only recently began monitoring them.
- The connection profile was verified to be current, and the Netwrix products were confirmed to connect successfully to the Entra tenant.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the connection profile for the Entra tenant.
2. Checked that Netwrix products could connect to the Entra tenant.
3. Analyzed error messages, including:
   - "PrepareTask for DC 'AZUREADINVENTORY' for task 'AAD Inventory' failed: Unspecified error."
   - "ExecuteScalar requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed."
4. Investigated potential SQL timeout issues, noting that the job task table times out at approximately 18 minutes.
5. Gathered debug logs to analyze the failure points.
6. Discussed the issue with technical support and escalated for further investigation.
7. Dropped EntraID tables as a last resort to resolve the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was primarily caused by an expired secret that led to access denial, which was subsequently fixed. However, the underlying problem was related to SQL execution errors, specifically timeouts occurring during the "Adding Domain" step of the scan process.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by dropping the EntraID tables, which allowed the collection jobs to run successfully. After this action, the jobs completed without further errors, indicating that the previous data in the tables may have been causing the timeout issues.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the execution time of the "Adding Domain" step, as it consistently took longer than expected and may contribute to future timeouts.
- Ensure that all secrets and credentials are up to date to prevent access issues.
- Regularly review SQL logs and event viewer logs for any indicators of connectivity issues or timeouts that may affect job execution.
