## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000H9QT3IAN
- **Case Number:** 424239
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society
- **Contact Name:** Jeremy Kaiser
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for AzureAD
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that some groups appeared in the Stealthbits AIC (Active Inventory Console), but when searched in the ADInventory_GroupView, they did not appear among the groups.

## Environment Details
- The affected groups were part of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
- The Azure AD Inventory job was not configured correctly.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the presence of the groups in the ADInventory_GroupView and found them missing.
2. Advised the customer to check their Active Directory for the groups.
3. Changed the query for Azure AD Inventory (ADI) to run a full scan.
4. Scheduled a follow-up meeting to investigate further if the groups still did not appear after the scan.
5. Discovered that the Azure AD Inventory job was not set up correctly and assigned the host to the job.
6. Ran a full Azure AD Inventory scan and then an Azure AD scan.
7. Reviewed the results from AzureADInventory_GroupMembersView to confirm the status of users in the groups.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the Azure AD Inventory job not being set up correctly, which prevented the accurate retrieval of group membership information from Azure AD.

## Solution
- The Azure AD Inventory job was configured properly.
- A full Azure AD Inventory scan was executed, which updated the group membership information.
- Upon review, it was confirmed that the previously removed users were no longer listed in the AzureADInventory_GroupMembersView and were also absent from the AIC.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Azure AD Inventory job is correctly configured to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly verify the status of group memberships in both AIC and ADInventory views to maintain accurate reporting.
