## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LJtW9IAL
- **Case Number:** 434312
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** New York City Department of Education
- **Contact Name:** Luis Noboa
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for AzureAD
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the EntraIDInventory process was failing with the error message: "ExecuteScalar requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed." This issue occurred after a successful run, leading to multiple failures in subsequent scans.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** StealthAUDIT for AzureAD
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.125
- **Timeout Setting:** 1440 minutes for the job

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed logs from the last four runs, noting one successful run followed by three failures.
2. Identified a UNIQUE key constraint error prior to the connection issue, which led to dropping the data and rescanning.
3. Observed that the error consistently occurred after the "Begin effective group membership calculation" log entry.
4. Investigated potential resource issues due to simultaneous backup operations during the scan.
5. Moved the scan schedule to avoid conflicts with backup operations.
6. Monitored the system for further occurrences of the error after the schedule change.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a resource contention problem. The EntraIDInventory scan was running concurrently with a backup process, leading to performance degradation and loss of connection to the database, which triggered the "ExecuteScalar" error.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by changing the schedule of the EntraIDInventory scan to run at a different time, avoiding overlap with the backup process. This adjustment allowed the scan to complete successfully without encountering the connection error.

## Notes
- It is advisable to monitor the scheduling of resource-intensive tasks to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider implementing alerts for connection issues to proactively address potential failures before they impact operations.
- Future scans should be tested after any changes to the environment or scheduling to ensure stability.
