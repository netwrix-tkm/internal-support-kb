## Problem Description
The customer requested information on creating Collections for cloud-based applications and on-premises databases, specifically inquiring about out-of-the-box solutions and any additional requirements for performing these scans.

## Environment Details
- The customer is using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.5.
- The inquiry pertains to both cloud-based applications and on-premises databases.

   - [Enterprise Auditor Solutions Overview](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/Overview.htm)
   - [Enterprise Auditor Requirements Overview](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Overview.htm)
3. Identified the supported database types, including MS SQL, AzureSQL, MongoDB, RedShift, PostgresSQL, Oracle, Db2, and MySQL.
4. Clarified that certain licensing is required for the requested collections.

## Root Cause
The issue stemmed from the customer's lack of awareness regarding the licensing requirements necessary to perform the desired collections for cloud-based applications and on-prem databases.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by providing the customer with the necessary documentation that outlines the available out-of-the-box solutions and the requirements for cloud-based applications. Additionally, it was communicated that the licensing needed for the requested collections was not available to the customer at that time. The customer was referred to the sales team for further assistance regarding licensing options.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the licensing status of customers when they inquire about specific features or functionalities.
- Future inquiries regarding cloud-based application collections should include a reminder to check the licensing requirements to avoid similar misunderstandings.
