## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000ExrY5IAJ
- **Case Number:** 419190
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Heena Suneja
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA for Oracle
- **Feature:** Instance Discovery
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with running the .Instance Discovery jobs for Oracle databases after migrating from AIX to RHEL operating systems. They were unable to find the Oracle DB instance while scanning the server, despite being able to connect manually using the correct connection details.

## Environment Details
- **Operating Systems:** AIX to RHEL
- **Database Approach:** Container databases (CDB) with pluggable databases (PDB)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed logs for the Oracle .InstanceDiscovery job.
2. Identified a username/password logon denied permissions error for the container hosting the pluggable database.
3. Discovered that the container did not have a user credential created, which could cause the permissions error.
4. Recommended creating a user account for the container and verifying the connection profile permissions:
   ```sql
   CONTAINER_DATA=ALL FOR %NAME_OF_PLUGGABLE_DATABASE% CONTAINER = CURRENT;
   ```
5. Suggested running the .InstanceDiscovery scan again after creating the credential.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the lack of a user credential for the container hosting the pluggable database, which resulted in denied permissions when attempting to run the .InstanceDiscovery job.

## Solution
The customer resolved the issue by updating the instance discovery Oracle servers job. Specific details on what was updated were not provided, but the resolution allowed the .InstanceDiscovery job to successfully identify the Oracle DB instance.

## Notes
- Ensure that user credentials are created for container databases when using the container database approach in Oracle.
- Verify that the connection profile used for running jobs has the necessary permissions to avoid similar issues in the future.
