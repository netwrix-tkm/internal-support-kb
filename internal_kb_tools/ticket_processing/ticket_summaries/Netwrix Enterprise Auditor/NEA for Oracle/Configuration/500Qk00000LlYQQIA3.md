- **Case Number:** 435503
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** WIS International
- **Contact Name:** Robert Parsons
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** NEA for Oracle
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer, WIS International, was unable to establish a connection from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) server to the Solaris server hosting their Oracle database. The setup for Oracle database scanning was reported to be challenging, and the customer sought assistance from Netwrix support.

## Environment Details
- **Oracle Database Version:** 11.2.0.4
- **Solaris Version:** 11.3

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the connection status and credentials used for the Oracle database.
2. Attempted to connect using Oracle SQL Developer, which was successful.
3. Reviewed the connection profile settings in NEA.
4. Discussed potential issues with the Linux team regarding connection settings.
5. Conducted a session to test the connection from the NEA server to the Oracle database.
6. Edited the connection profile by switching the Oracle role from Sysdba to Default.
7. Added all relevant hosts to the connection profile and tested the connections.

## Root Cause
The initial issue was due to incorrect settings in the connection profile, specifically the Oracle role being set to Sysdba, which restricted access. Changing the role to Default resolved the connectivity issue.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Editing the connection profile in NEA to switch the Oracle role from Sysdba to Default.
- Ensuring that all relevant hosts were added to the connection profile.
- Successfully testing the connections after making these adjustments.

## Notes
- Ensure that the connection profile settings are correctly configured before attempting to connect to the Oracle database.
- Future setups should verify the Oracle role and permissions to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to conduct a test connection using Oracle SQL Developer as a preliminary step to confirm connectivity before configuring NEA.
