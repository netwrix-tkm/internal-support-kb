## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Ir5qRIAR
- **Case Number:** 428321
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Point32Health Services, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Peter Sterianos
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for EMC
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with their Seek jobs in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, encountering a database error related to the loading of the `System.Data.SQLite` assembly. The specific error message indicated that the located assembly's manifest definition did not match the assembly reference.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) Version:** 11.6.0.111
- **NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) Version:** 11.6.0.13

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the error message received during the Seek job execution.
2. Checked the current version of the `System.Data.SQLite.dll` file in the installation directories.
3. Ran a PowerShell command to locate all instances of `system.data.sqlite.dll`:
   ```powershell
   Clear-Host
   Set-Location $env:SAINSTALLDIR
   Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "system.data.sqlite.dll" | Format-List -property *version*
   ```
4. Identified that the incorrect version `1.0.110.0` was present in the `E:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDITFSAA` directory.
5. Copied the correct version `1.0.117.0` of `system.data.sqlite.dll` from the appropriate directory to the affected directory.
6. Conducted a 0 depth scan to test the functionality, which was successful.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the presence of an outdated version of the `System.Data.SQLite.dll` file (`1.0.110.0`) in the StealthAUDIT installation directory, which did not match the expected version (`1.0.117.0`). This mismatch led to the failure of the Seek jobs.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by replacing the outdated `System.Data.SQLite.dll` file with the correct version. The following steps were taken:
- The correct `system.data.sqlite.dll` version `1.0.117.0` was copied to the directory `E:\Program Files (x86)\STEALTHbits\StealthAUDITFSAA`.
- A successful 0 depth scan was performed to confirm that the Seek jobs could now run without errors.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all DLLs are updated during patches to prevent similar issues in the future.
- The development team is investigating the underlying cause of why the outdated DLL was not updated during the last patch.
- Future cases should include a check for outdated binaries in the installation directories to avoid similar assembly loading issues.
