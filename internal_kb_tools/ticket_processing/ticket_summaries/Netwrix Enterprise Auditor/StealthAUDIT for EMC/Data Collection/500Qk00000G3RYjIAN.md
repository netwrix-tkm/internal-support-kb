## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000G3RYjIAN
- **Case Number:** 421694
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** The Fresh Market
- **Contact Name:** Ian Rojo
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for EMC
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues integrating EMC Isilon with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Specifically, they were unable to find any activity log files post-patching since the last scan on February 7, 2025. Additionally, there were prior issues with the NEA host/account not being able to read the registry on the NAM Agent host.

## Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Integration Target:** EMC Isilon
- **Agent Version:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified permissions within OneFS and Windows Agent/Proxy host.
2. Installed the EMC host certificate to the Trusted ROOT store.
3. Added the other EMC cluster host to NAM to match the FQDN name seen within Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
4. Checked the initial Agent log path for the HQ..FS02 host via NetBIOS name.
5. Corrected the Remote Registry access issue.
6. Confirmed that the necessary Isilon nodes were forwarding events to the CEE agent system.
7. Set the FSAC job to use the Proxy as a Service to collect Isilon events.
8. Added the Proxy install path to the system environmental variables to point to the E: drive.
9. Reviewed the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) FSAC scan pulling EMC data collected by the NAM agent.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as incorrect configuration settings related to the integration of the EMC Isilon with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Specifically, there were issues with permissions and registry access that prevented the NEA from reading necessary data.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Correcting the configuration settings as per the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 documentation for Dell Isilon/PowerScale Activity Auditing Configuration.
- Ensuring that the FSAC job was properly set to use the Proxy for data collection.
- Successfully performing a bulk import for the EMC host, which was previously noted as needed.
- Adding the missing Reporting Group back into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console.

## Notes
- Future integrations with EMC Isilon should ensure that all necessary permissions are granted and configurations are verified according to the documentation.
- It is advisable to monitor the Proxy settings and ensure that the environmental variables are correctly set to avoid similar issues.
- If issues arise post-patching, check for any changes in configuration or permissions that may have occurred during the update process.
