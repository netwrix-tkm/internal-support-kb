3. Performed a clean upgrade of the software and rebooted the NEA server, but the issue persisted.
4. Uninstalled the NEA console and SDD component.
5. Rebooted the NEA server.
6. Installed NEA version 11.6.0.130 and SDD version 11.6.0.17.
7. Ran the 0-CreateSchema job.
8. Kicked off the SEEK job group and monitored its progress.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an incorrect configuration related to the Netwrix server, specifically involving registry access issues that arose after applying the hotfixes.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by performing the following steps:
1. Uninstalling the NEA console and SDD component.
2. Rebooting the NEA server to clear any residual configurations.
3. Installing the latest versions of NEA and SDD.
4. Running the 0-CreateSchema job to ensure the database schema was correctly set up.
5. Initiating the SEEK job group, which successfully began scanning without errors.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that all components are fully uninstalled and the server is rebooted before reinstalling to avoid conflicts with old binaries.
- Future updates should be monitored closely for any similar registry access issues, especially after applying hotfixes or patches.
- If similar issues arise, consider checking the registry permissions and ensuring that the COM components are correctly registered.
