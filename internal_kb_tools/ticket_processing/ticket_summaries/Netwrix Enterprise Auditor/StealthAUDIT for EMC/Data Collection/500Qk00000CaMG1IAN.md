- **Case Number:** 413806
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Atlas Air
- **Contact Name:** Duane Jarrett
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for EMC
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that users and groups in the Built-in Administrators group were not appearing in the folder permission reports generated by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Environment Details
- The system is running on OneFS Version 9.4.0.13.
- The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version in use is 11.5.0.276.
- The environment utilizes Active Directory Services for membership and role authentication.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the configuration of the environment.
2. Reviewed the job configurations and the EMC host settings via Windows Computer Management.
3. Attempted to run a TSQL query in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to retrieve necessary details regarding folder permissions.
4. Adjusted the configuration from EMC Celerra to NAS based on the Netwrix documentation for File System Solution.
5. Added the service account to the BackupAdmin Role during a meeting to ensure proper permissions.
6. Conducted a new scan of the file system to check if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The initial configuration of the FSAA scan was not optimized for the EMC Isilon OneFS environment, leading to incomplete data retrieval regarding the Built-in Administrators group. The system was incorrectly identified as an EMC Celerra device, which affected the scan's efficiency.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding the necessary scoping options to the FSAA scan configuration, which allowed the scan to complete successfully without timing out.
- Ensuring that the service account had the appropriate permissions by adding it to the BackupAdmin Role.
- Conducting a new scan after adjusting the configuration, which successfully included the nested groups within the Built-in Administrators group in the reports.

## Notes
- Future configurations should ensure that the correct device type (EMC Isilon OneFS) is selected to avoid similar issues.
- It is recommended to regularly review and update the permissions and roles assigned to service accounts to maintain proper access levels for auditing tasks.
- If issues persist after configuration changes, consider engaging professional services for further assistance with report generation and configuration.
