## Problem Description
The customer requested Effective Access Auditing for DELL Powerstore shares, as file system auditing in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) had not been functional for some time. The issue was identified as needing a new ticket for FSAA scans on the NAS.

## Environment Details
- The scans were initially configured to point to an outdated host list filled with decommissioned servers.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Created a new host list for the NAS device and initiated the FSAA collection scan.
2. Identified that the scan was pointing to an old host list.
3. Corrected the host list to point to valid servers.
4. Allowed the scan to run and monitored its progress.
5. Adjusted scan settings to limit depth to 2 levels to expedite future scans if necessary.
6. Verified data reporting in the Access Information Center (AIC) after the scan completion.

## Root Cause
The initial misconfiguration of the host list, which pointed to non-existent servers, prevented the FSAA scans from functioning correctly.

## Solution
- The host list was corrected to include valid servers.
- The scan was allowed to run, and upon completion, it was verified that the data reported correctly in the AIC.
- The scan depth was set back to full depth after confirming successful operation to ensure comprehensive auditing in future scans.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the scan settings and ensure they are configured correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- After confirming the scan's success, the scan depth should be reset to full to ensure complete data collection, as limiting the depth may lead to incomplete auditing results.
