- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Point32Health Services, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Peter Sterianos
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** StealthAUDIT for EMC
- **Feature:** Access Auditing
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the bulk import for the Filesystem FSAA was failing, generating error messages indicating a mismatch between Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases. The error specifically stated that access data needed to be reset in order to proceed with the import.

## Environment Details
- The issue occurred within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor platform, specifically using the StealthAUDIT for EMC component.
- The version in use was 11.5.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The customer was advised to reset the filesystem data by setting the `AccessGUID` to 'RESET' in the `SA_FSAA_Hosts` table.
2. The customer performed the reset as instructed and attempted to rerun the FSAA bulk import.
3. The customer encountered a new error stating, "User does not have permission to perform this action."
4. A meeting was scheduled to further investigate the permissions issue.
5. During the meeting, it was discovered that the FSAA Bulk import was failing due to a permissions-based issue on the update statistics SQL script for the analysis task.
6. The SQL DBAs were contacted to fix the permission issue.

## Root Cause
The initial failure of the FSAA bulk import was due to a mismatch between Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases, requiring a reset of access data. Subsequent errors were caused by insufficient permissions for the service account used in the bulk import job.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Resetting the access data as per the initial instructions.
- Addressing the permissions issue by granting the necessary permissions to the service account used for the bulk import.
- After the permissions were fixed, the bulk import was successfully executed without errors.

## Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the service account used for bulk imports has the necessary permissions to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Always verify the status of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 databases before performing bulk imports to prevent mismatches.
- Document any changes made to permissions or configurations for future reference.
