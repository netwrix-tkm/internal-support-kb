- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Audit
- **Version:** 12.0.0.1051

## Problem Description
An employee upgraded the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 12.0.0.1051. Following the upgrade, users reported that the option to manually add individuals to resource groups was no longer available, which was a feature present in the previous version (11.6.0.37).

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 11.6.0.37
- **Current Version:** 12.0.0.1051
- **User Role:** Administrator

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Logged into AIC 12.0.0.1051 with an Administrator account.
2. Navigated to Home > "Resource Owners".
3. Clicked on the "Resource Audit" button.
4. Attempted to edit Group Membership.
5. Observed the absence of the "SET DATE" functionality and "Expired" column that were present in version 11.6.0.37.
6. Reviewed attached screenshots from both versions for comparison.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an incorrect configuration setting in the Access Information Center following the upgrade. Specifically, the settings that allow changes to group membership were not enabled.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. Navigated to "Home" > "Configuration" > "Active Directory".
2. Ensured that the checkbox for "Allow this account to make changes to group membership" was checked and clicked the "Save" button.
3. Returned to the Home Page, clicked on "RESOURCE OWNER", selected the relevant Resource Name, and clicked the blue "UPDATE" button.
4. In the "Update resource" popup, under step 3 "Access Groups", ensured that the following boxes were checked:
   - "Allow access requests"
   - "Allow owners to change access"

## Notes
- Users should verify that the necessary permissions and settings are enabled after any upgrade to avoid similar issues.
- It is advisable to document any changes made during upgrades to facilitate troubleshooting in the future.
- The absence of the "SET DATE" functionality and "Expired" column in the new version should be communicated to users to manage expectations regarding feature availability.
