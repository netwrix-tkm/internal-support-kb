- **Case Number:** 441939
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bank of New Hampshire
- **Contact Name:** Casey Nialetz
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Audit
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The Access Information Center (AIC) was displaying an old scan date for a specific server (SVOC-FS01), which was failing to complete scans and bulk imports.

## Environment Details
- The client was running version 11.5.0.210 of the software.
- The issue was related to the T2 database holding stale information about hosts that were no longer available.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Logged into AIC and navigated to the resource audit section.
2. Verified that SVOC-FS01 was showing an outdated scan date.
3. Checked the FSAA_Hosts table in SQL and confirmed that SVOC-FS01 was not listed.
4. Identified that the T2 database contained leftover data for SVOC-FS01.
5. Renamed the T2 database folder for SVOC-FS01 to SVOC-FS01.old0414.
6. Configured the host assignment for the FSAA scan and bulk import to target only SVOC-FS01.
7. Ran a zero-level scan, which completed successfully with good data.
8. Executed the bulk import interactively.
9. Confirmed that SVOC-FS01 was now present in the FSAA_Hosts table.
10. Set the scan depth back to 10 levels and planned to adjust to full depth after confirming the scan completion.
11. Initiated a permissions group scan.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a sequencing problem where SVOC-FS01 was no longer present in the FSAA_Hosts table but still had leftover data in the T2 database. This stale data prevented the bulk import job from completing successfully.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by deleting/renaming the old T2 data for SVOC-FS01, which allowed the system to recognize the server correctly. After this, a new scan was run, and the bulk import succeeded.

## Notes
- After the resolution, it was advised to monitor the completion of the 10-level scan and check for fresh data in AIC.
- The client should be reminded to adjust the scan depth to full depth after confirming the successful completion of the current scan.
- The client is expected to upgrade to version 12.0, but it was recommended to first upgrade to version 11.6.
