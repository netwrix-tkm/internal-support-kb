## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LAT9ZIAX
- **Case Number:** 433857
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MYR Group
- **Contact Name:** Michael Lindahl
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Audit
- **Version:** 10.7

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Access Information Center (AIC) was only displaying activity information for one Nasuni device, while no activity was reported for others.

## Environment Details
- The issue involved multiple Nasuni devices being monitored by the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
- The customer had recently installed a proxy server to facilitate scanning of Azure-based Nasuni devices.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Initial Investigation**: Verified that the job for the Nasuni devices was run and that data was imported into the database.
2. **Data Interpretation**: Checked how AIC was interpreting the data from the database, noting discrepancies in displayed activity.
3. **Host Mapping Removal**: Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan to prevent NEA from querying every host against every agent.
4. **Scan Execution**: Conducted a successful scan after the host mapping removal, confirming activity data correlated to the correct hosts in AIC.
5. **Report Optimization**: Removed unnecessary analysis tasks from weekly reports to improve performance.
6. **Group Reassignment**: Moved the Group Usage group from File System Activity to the AD Activity group.
7. **Permission Issues**: Identified that the AIC Effective Access Report was not displaying deeper folder levels due to insufficient read permissions.
8. **Domain Controller Adjustment**: Removed a second Domain Controller from the ADI scan that was already being scanned.

## Root Cause
The primary issue was related to the configuration of the FSAC jobs, specifically that only one of the two Nasuni servers was being utilized in the activity jobs. Additionally, the lack of proper permissions on deeper folder levels prevented the effective access report from displaying correctly.

## Solution
- The resolution involved:
  - Removing the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan, which allowed for successful scans across all configured hosts.
  - Ensuring that the connection profile account had sufficient permissions (recommended Local Admin rights) to view permissions on the Nasuni filers.
  - Confirming that the FSAC scan and bulk import jobs were scheduled to run in the correct order to ensure data was collected and imported properly.

## Notes
- The customer was advised to monitor the scans to ensure they run without issues.
- It was confirmed that the normal FSAC scan could be run daily without the FSAA scan, as the latter was being handled by a proxy server.
- The customer expressed satisfaction with the resolution and inquired about the possibility of requesting the same support engineer for future tickets.
