## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Da12vIAB
- **Case Number:** 416184
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TSMC
- **Contact Name:** Support Sphinxtec
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Audit
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Access Information Center (AIC) where querying activity details for the date 7/18 returned results for 7/19 instead, with no activity details available for 7/18.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.0
- **Build Number:** 11.0.0.83
- The issue was reproducible in both the customer environment and a lab environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Customer provided logs and screenshots demonstrating the issue.
2. Technical support requested additional activity logs from the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) to verify timestamps.
3. The support team escalated the issue to the R&D team for further investigation.
4. The R&D team analyzed the logs and confirmed that the issue was related to timezone discrepancies, specifically with the AIC defaulting to GMT instead of the local timezone (GMT+8).
5. The customer was advised to upgrade to the latest version of AIC.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a product defect where the AIC was not correctly translating the local timezone settings, leading to incorrect date results in activity queries.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by releasing a fix in version 11.6.0.132 of the AIC. The customer was instructed to upgrade to this version to correct the timezone handling and ensure accurate activity detail results.

## Notes
- The customer was using an outdated version (11.0) which was no longer supported as of April 2024. It is crucial for customers to keep their software updated to receive fixes and support.
- Future cases should ensure that customers are aware of the importance of timezone settings in the AIC to prevent similar issues.
