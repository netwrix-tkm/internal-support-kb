## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000Npk3cIAB
- **Case Number:** 441372
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Extron Electronics
- **Contact Name:** Stephen Byrd
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Commit Changes
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that several servers were scanned successfully for permissions, but the data did not update in the Access Information Center (AIC). Upon logging into the AIC, discrepancies in the data were observed, indicating that the information had not been updated.

## Environment Details
- **Issue Type:** Server/Infrastructure Issue - Customer-Managed System
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** Access Information Center

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the FSAA Bulk Import was running successfully after the scans.
2. Reviewed the FSAA scan error report for the server USA-ANA-ENGRNT2, which indicated a `System.TimeoutException` and issues with the scan session.
3. Set the job to Debug mode to gather more detailed logs for further analysis.
4. Scheduled a meeting with the customer to review the permission scan logs and discuss the discrepancies.
5. Collected and analyzed the DEBUG log file from the most recent scan run.
6. Verified the status of the proxy server and checked if the required ports were open.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the discrepancies in the AIC was identified as a failure in the bulk import process, which was being addressed in a separate ticket (442548). Additionally, issues with the proxy server not responding and potential port blocking were contributing factors.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by addressing the bulk import failure, which was confirmed to be the primary cause of the data discrepancies in the AIC. The customer was advised to ensure that the proxy server was operational and that the necessary ports were open for communication. After these actions were taken, the data in the AIC began updating correctly.

## Notes
- It is important to monitor the status of the proxy server and ensure that all required ports are open to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regular checks on the bulk import process should be conducted to ensure data integrity in the Access Information Center.
- If discrepancies are observed in the AIC, reviewing the scan logs and error reports can provide valuable insights into potential underlying issues.
