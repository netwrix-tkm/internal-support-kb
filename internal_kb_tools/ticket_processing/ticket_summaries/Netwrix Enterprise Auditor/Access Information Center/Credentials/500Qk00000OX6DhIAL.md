## Problem Description
The customer reported that after logging into the Access Information Center (AIC) version 12, no data or values were displayed.

## Environment Details
- The issue was observed after the installation of version 12.0 of the AIC.
- The user account used for login had a "Request Access" role, which may not have sufficient permissions.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs for the AIC to check for errors related to SQL connections.
2. Attempted to log in using the built-in admin account (username: admin, password: sb).
3. Confirmed that the built-in admin account had not been logged in before, prompting a password setup.
4. After logging in with the built-in admin account, verified that the AIC was functioning correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the user account having insufficient permissions (specifically, a "Request Access" role) to view data in the AIC. There were no SQL connection errors, indicating that the database connection was functioning properly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by logging in with the built-in admin account, which had the necessary permissions to access and display data in the AIC. The customer was then able to confirm that the AIC was working as expected.

## Notes
- It is important to ensure that user accounts have the appropriate roles and permissions configured in the AIC to avoid similar issues in the future.
