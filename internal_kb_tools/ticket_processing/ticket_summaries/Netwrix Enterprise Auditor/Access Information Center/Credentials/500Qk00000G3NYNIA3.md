- **Account/Company:** Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association
- **Contact Name:** Jonathan Candido
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center

## Problem Description
The customer reported an inability to access the web portal for performing a user group audit, encountering a 503 error.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Error Message:** 503 Service Unavailable

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the web portal URL and access permissions.
2. Checked the server status and logs for any indications of service interruptions.
3. Confirmed that the service account credentials were correct.
4. Investigated the IIS settings related to the service account.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the service account associated with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) being updated with a new password, while the relevant IIS settings were not updated accordingly.

## Solution
The resolution involved updating the IIS server with the new service account credentials. Once the credentials were correctly configured, the AIC portal began to load properly without the 503 error.

## Notes
- Ensure that any updates to service account passwords are followed by a review and update of all related configurations, especially in IIS settings.
- Regular audits of service account credentials and their configurations can help prevent similar issues in the future.
