## Problem Description
The customer reported that images embedded in emails sent from the Access Information Center (AIC) were not loading in end-user mailboxes. This issue had persisted for approximately three months.

## Environment Details
- The images were hosted on the same server as the AIC.
- The server did not have internet access, and images were not accessible to unauthenticated users.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the environment with the customer to confirm the hosting setup of images.
2. Identified that images required user authentication to be viewed.
3. Suggested multiple scenarios to the customerâ€™s Security Team:
   - Allow read access to image files for all users.
   - Host images on a server with internet access and make them publicly available.
4. Proposed using Base64 encoding to embed images directly into email templates as a temporary workaround.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was that the images were hosted on a server that did not allow unauthenticated access. Users needed to log in to view the images, which was not feasible for the email recipients.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by implementing Base64 encoding for images directly into the email templates. This method allowed images to be embedded within the email itself, eliminating the need for external hosting or user authentication. The customer was instructed on how to encode images using a Base64 encoder and how to format the HTML in their email templates.

### Example Code for Base64 Encoding
For images:
```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,[HERE]" alt="Embedded Image">
```
For PDF files:
```html
<object data="data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400">
    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href="data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]">here</a>.</p>
</object>
```
*(Replace [HERE] with the actual Base64 string.)*

## Notes
- This Base64 encoding solution is a temporary fix and should not be implemented as a permanent solution without considering the implications on email size and performance.
- The customer has multiple feature requests pending that may address this issue more robustly in the future.
