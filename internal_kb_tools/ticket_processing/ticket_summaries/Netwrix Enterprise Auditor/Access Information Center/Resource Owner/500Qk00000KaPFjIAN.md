## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000KaPFjIAN
- **Case Number:** 431998
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** PERN S.A.
- **Contact Name:** Support Appeal
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Owner
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an intermittent issue in the Access Information Center (AIC) console where an error message stating "There are no domains available to search" appears when attempting to add or change an owner for a resource. This issue occurs unpredictably, approximately twice a week, and prevents the AIC admin from searching for or selecting users from Active Directory (AD). Restarting the AIC service temporarily resolves the issue, but this is not a viable long-term solution.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Build Number:** 11.6.0.21

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Collected logs and screenshots from the AIC console during the occurrence of the error.
2. Attempted to reproduce the issue based on the steps provided by the customer.
3. Engaged SWAT team for further analysis and potential solutions.
4. Monitored the AIC console for any recurrence of the issue after initial troubleshooting.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was not definitively identified during the troubleshooting process. The problem was characterized as unpredictable and irreproducible, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific cause.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by closely monitoring the AIC console for any recurrence of the error after the initial troubleshooting steps. The error did not reappear during the monitoring period, leading to the decision to close the case. The customer was informed of the monitoring results and agreed to close the case.

## Notes
- The issue is highly unpredictable, and while restarting the AIC service temporarily resolves the problem, it is not a permanent fix.
- Future cases with similar symptoms should involve thorough log analysis and monitoring to identify any patterns or triggers for the error.
- It is recommended to keep the customer informed about any updates or patches that may address underlying issues in future product versions.
