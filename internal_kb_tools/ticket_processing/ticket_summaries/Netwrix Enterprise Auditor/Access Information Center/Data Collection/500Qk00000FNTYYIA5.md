## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FNTYYIA5
- **Case Number:** 420182
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Motiva Enterprises
- **Contact Name:** James Rigoulot
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Data Collection
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Access Information Center (AIC) was not displaying or reporting attribute changes for Active Directory (AD) users, despite known changes being made to specific users.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 16

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the AIC was configured correctly to track attribute changes.
2. Checked the reports section for any existing data on attribute changes.
3. Confirmed that changes were made to specific AD users.
4. Investigated the scanning settings for Active Directory Inventory.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as the customer not running differential scans for Active Directory Inventory. Without these scans, attribute changes were not being collected by the AIC.

## Solution
The resolution involved instructing the customer to enable differential scans for Active Directory Inventory. Once this was configured, the AIC began to report attribute changes as expected.

## Notes
- It is important for users to regularly run differential scans to ensure that attribute changes are captured in the AIC.
- Future inquiries regarding similar issues should include verification of scanning settings to prevent similar oversights.
