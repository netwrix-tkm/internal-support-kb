- **Case Number:** 419584
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Ashish Mohan
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the installation of the Access Information Center (AIC), stating that the installation was failing despite providing the correct database credentials.

## Environment Details
- The customer operates in the Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone.
- The installation was being performed on a system with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) access.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message during installation: "SQL Error: Login failed for user 'nprdstealthaudit'."
2. Advised the customer to perform a .udl test to check database access, which was successful.
3. Confirmed that the user could connect to the database using SSMS without issues.
4. Checked the permissions for the user in Management Studio, confirming that the user was assigned as a database owner.
5. Reviewed IIS settings and ensured all requirements were met.
6. Tested the connection to the database through a .udl test.
7. Verified that ports 81 and 481 were open.
8. Checked the registry for previous installations of the Access Information Center.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by insufficient permissions for the user account initially being used for the installation. Although the user had access to the database, the permissions were not adequate for the installation process.

## Solution
The resolution involved the following steps:
- The Database Administrator (DBA) created a new SQL account for the user.
- Logged into Management Studio to check and confirm the permissions for the new user.
- Assigned the new user as a database owner for the relevant database.
- Reset the password for the default admin account to ensure proper access.

After these changes, the installation of the AIC was successful.

## Notes
- Ensure that any user accounts used for installations have the appropriate permissions, ideally as database owners, to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Always verify that the necessary ports are open and that there are no previous installations that could interfere with the current setup.
