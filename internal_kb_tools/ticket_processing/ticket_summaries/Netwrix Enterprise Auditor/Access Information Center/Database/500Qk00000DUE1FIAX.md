## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000DUE1FIAX
- **Case Number:** 415933
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Paper Company
- **Contact Name:** Mark Holley
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5.0.272

## Problem Description
The customer reported issues with importing the group "NA-MEASAppServers-G" into the Access Information Center (AIC). Although the import process initially indicated success with a green status, it ultimately failed with an error related to a UNIQUE KEY constraint violation.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA):** 11.5.0.272
- **Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC):** 115.0.136

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the logs and identified the error message: 
   ```
   Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'UQ_SA_AIC_Resources'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.SA_AIC_Resources'.
   ```
2. Checked the status of the group "NA-MEASAppServers-G" in the AIC and found it was marked as deleted.
3. Executed SQL commands to update the `IsDeleted` status for the relevant group IDs:
   ```sql
   UPDATE [SA_ADInventory_Principals] SET [IsDeleted] = 0 WHERE ID IN (194019, 163088, 177012, 187014);
   ```
4. Matched the groups in the `SA_ADInventory_GroupsView` table via the `PrincipalId`.
5. Initiated a new Active Directory Import (ADI) differential scan after confirming the group was in the correct Organizational Unit (OU).
6. Corrected the Drop AD job and scheduled it to run manually at 4 PM on Fridays.
7. Re-ran the ADI job to repopulate the groups.
8. Identified and deleted the duplicate entry in the `SA_AIC_Resources` table:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM [SA_AIC_Resources] WHERE ID = 49222;
   ```
9. Successfully imported the required owner via CSV after resolving the duplicate issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a duplicate entry in the `SA_AIC_Resources` table, which violated the UNIQUE KEY constraint during the import process. The group "NA-MEASAppServers-G" was also marked as deleted, preventing its proper import.

## Solution
The resolution involved:
- Updating the `IsDeleted` status of the affected groups to allow them to be imported.
- Deleting the duplicate entry from the `SA_AIC_Resources` table that was causing the UNIQUE KEY constraint violation.
- Successfully re-importing the group after these corrections were made.

## Notes
- Ensure that groups are not marked as deleted before attempting to import them.
- Regularly check for duplicate entries in the `SA_AIC_Resources` table to prevent similar issues.
- Consider upgrading to the latest version of the AIC if similar issues arise, as fixes may be included in newer releases.
