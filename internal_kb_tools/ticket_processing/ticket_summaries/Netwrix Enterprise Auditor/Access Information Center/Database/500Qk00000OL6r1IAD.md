- **Case Number:** 442831
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Motors, LLC
- **Contact Name:** Holly Smith
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an access issue with the Access Information Center (AIC) in version 11.6, suspecting it was related to a certificate that needed to be updated. Attempts to access the AIC using the desktop link resulted in no response from the server.

## Environment Details
- The server was changed to use HTTPS on port 481, while the desktop link was still configured to use HTTP on port 81.
- The AIC was experiencing issues resolving the NetBIOS name of the domain and was not receiving responses from the SQL server.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the AIC link was using the correct port (481) and HTTPS protocol.
2. Attempted to access the AIC, which failed due to unresolved NetBIOS name and SQL server response issues.
3. Unlocked the default admin account and reconfigured SQL credentials.
4. Restarted the AIC service, which did not bind to the port properly.
5. Suggested the customer reboot the server during off hours to see if it resolved the service issues.

## Root Cause
The access issue was primarily caused by the mismatch between the desktop link's HTTP configuration on port 81 and the server's new HTTPS configuration on port 481. Additionally, a large database migration task was causing SQL timeout errors, which prevented the AIC from functioning correctly.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by manually migrating the larger database tables to allow the migration to complete successfully. This action enabled the AIC to function properly. The customer was also advised to ensure that the AIC link was updated to use the correct HTTPS port.

## Notes
- Ensure that any changes to server protocols and ports are reflected in all client links to avoid access issues.
- Monitor SQL server performance and timeout settings, especially during large migration tasks, to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Consider scheduling regular maintenance windows for server reboots to minimize downtime and service disruptions.
