## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message in the AIC Console after migrating the Stealthaudit database to a new SQL server. The error displayed was: "Unable to contact the SQL server database."

## Environment Details
- The database migration involved moving the Stealthaudit database to a new SQL server.
- The storage settings were updated to reflect the new SQL server location.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the database migration and updated storage settings.
2. Attempted to access the AIC Console, which resulted in the error message.
3. Identified that the AIC was not configured to use the new database.
4. Planned a meeting for live troubleshooting with the customer.
5. Reinstalled the AIC to reconfigure the database settings.

## Root Cause
The AIC Console was not updated with the new database information after the migration, leading to a failure to connect to the backend database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by reinstalling the AIC, which allowed for the reconfiguration of the database settings to point to the correct SQL server location. After the reinstallation, the AIC Console was able to start successfully.

## Notes
- Ensure that all components of the Netwrix product are updated with the new database information after any migration.
- Document any changes made during the migration process to facilitate troubleshooting in the future.
