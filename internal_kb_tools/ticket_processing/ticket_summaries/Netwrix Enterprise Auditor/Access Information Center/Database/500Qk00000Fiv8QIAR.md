- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Allstate Insurance Company
- **Contact Name:** Stealth Audit

- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the AIC (Access Information Center) console could not be opened on servers with version 11.6 installed, resulting in an unsuccessful connection.

## Environment Details
- **Impacted Servers:** 
  - Y0775-APP0666-S
  - B0185-APP0701-S
  - B0185-APP0702-S
- **Authentication Method:** Initially configured for Windows Authentication, but logs indicated SQL Authentication was being used.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified certificates on the server and checked IIS settings; all appeared normal.
2. Reviewed AIC logs to identify authentication issues.
3. Noted that the service was using SQL Authentication instead of the configured Windows Authentication.
4. Suggested checking the AIC logs for further insights.
5. Reassigned the case to the team lead for additional investigation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch in the authentication configuration. The AIC was set to use Windows Authentication, but the service was attempting to connect using SQL Authentication.

## Solution
- Reinstalled the AIC application on the servers B0185-APP0701-S and B0185-APP0702-S using the sys-SA_Envscan account.
- The server Y0775-APP0666-S was resolved by the customer switching the service account in the AIC settings to align with the correct authentication method.

## Notes
- Ensure that the authentication settings in AIC are consistent with the service account being used to avoid similar issues in the future.
- It is advisable to regularly check AIC logs for any discrepancies in authentication methods to preemptively address potential connection issues.
