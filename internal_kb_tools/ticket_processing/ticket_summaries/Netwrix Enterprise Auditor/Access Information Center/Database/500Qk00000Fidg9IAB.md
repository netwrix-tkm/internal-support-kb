- **Account/Company:** Gloucester Police
- **Contact Name:** Tony Knock
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after migrating the SQL database for StealthAudit, they were unable to log in to the web portal. All accounts received the error message: "Unable to contact the SQL Server Database." The new SQL database being used is SQL 2022.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Database Configuration:** Old database server was configured in AIC.
- **New Database Version:** SQL 2022.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that the console on the server was functioning correctly.
2. Checked all monitoring tools to ensure they were operational.
3. Confirmed that the migration process followed the instructions provided on the website.
4. Attempted to log in to the web portal with multiple accounts to replicate the issue.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as an incorrect configuration related to the new SQL database connection settings in the Access Information Center (AIC) after the migration.

## Solution
The resolution involved reconfiguring the AIC to point to the new SQL database server following the migration. Once the configuration was updated, users were able to log in to the web portal without encountering the error message.

## Notes
- Ensure that any future migrations include a verification step to confirm that the AIC is correctly configured to connect to the new database server.
- It is advisable to document the configuration settings for both the old and new database servers to facilitate troubleshooting in similar cases.
