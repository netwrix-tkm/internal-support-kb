## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GYar4IAD
- **Case Number:** 422753
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Vistra Corporate Services Co.
- **Contact Name:** Hanif Parupia
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported being unable to log in to the AIC site, receiving an error message stating "Unable to contact the SQL Server Database."

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Build Number:** 116
- **Age:** 13.9 days

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the error message received during login attempts.
2. Checked the SQL Server Database connectivity.
3. Assessed disk space on the SQL Server Data and Logs drives.
4. Identified that the SQL Server Data and Logs drives were very low on space.
5. Added additional space to both the SQL Server Data and Logs drives.
6. Configured the NTP Database Maintenance settings to ensure proper maintenance of the NVMonitorData DB.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient disk space on the SQL Server Data and Logs drives, which prevented the application from contacting the database.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Adding additional disk space to both the SQL Server Data and Logs drives.
- Configuring the Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) Database Maintenance to correctly maintain the NVMonitorData database. This configuration can be found in the Administration section of the NTP documentation.

**Reference for Database Maintenance Configuration:**

```

## Notes
- If the Database Maintenance feature is not configured correctly, it may lead to insufficient permissions, preventing proper maintenance of the database.
