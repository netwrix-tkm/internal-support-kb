## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L7hAfIAJ
- **Case Number:** 433716
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** EverBank
- **Contact Name:** Bradley Dickinson
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Database
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that after changing the password for the DEV StealthAudit SQL account, the web Access Information Center (AIC) could not connect to the SQL database. It prompted for credentials, but none were accepted.

## Environment Details
- **StealthAudit Version:** 11.5
- **Database Type:** SQL Server

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Changed the password in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) for the SQL account.
2. Attempted to log into AIC using the default "admin" user and password.
3. Navigated to "Configure Console" and "Database" in AIC.
4. Entered the new database password for the SQL account in AIC.
5. Verified that AIC was functioning correctly after the password update.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the AIC not recognizing the updated database password for users other than the "admin" user. It appears that only the "admin" user could successfully update the database password in AIC, which allowed for proper access.

## Solution
To resolve the issue:
1. Logged into AIC using the "admin" user credentials.
2. Updated the database password in the AIC configuration to match the new password set in NEA.
3. Confirmed that AIC was operational after the password update.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always log in as the "admin" user when changing the database password to ensure proper access and functionality for all users.
- Other users may face access issues if the database password is not current, even if they have the correct credentials.
