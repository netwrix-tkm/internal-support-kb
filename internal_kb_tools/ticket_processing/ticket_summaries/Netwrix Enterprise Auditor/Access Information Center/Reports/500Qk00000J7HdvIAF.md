## Problem Description
The customer reported an error when attempting to search for a user in the Access Information Center (AIC) and generate reports. The error message indicated that the request could not be completed, suggesting that the application log file might contain helpful troubleshooting information.

## Environment Details
- **Previous Version:** 11.5

   - HTTP Status Code: 500
   - URL: `/v2/admins/data/audit/reports/trustee/memberof`
2. Confirmed that the issue persisted after upgrading from version 11.5 to 11.6, which was believed to have resolved the issue.
3. Communicated with the customer regarding the status of the issue and the need for an upgrade to the latest build.
4. Informed the customer that a fix was available in the latest AIC build (v11.6.0.36) and advised them to update.

## Root Cause

## Solution
The customer successfully resolved the issue by upgrading to the latest AIC build (v11.6.0.36). After the installation of the upgrade, the error was no longer present, and the user search and report generation functions worked as expected.
