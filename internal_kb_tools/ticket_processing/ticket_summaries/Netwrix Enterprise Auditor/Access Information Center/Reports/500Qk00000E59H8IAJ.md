- **Case Number:** 417269
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** John Deere Company
- **Contact Name:** Scott Prigge
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6.0.21

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with the Access Information Center (AIC) where an error occurred when searching for a username and selecting the "Permissions" report. The error message indicated a status 500 when attempting to access the report.

## Environment Details
- Current AIC Version prior to troubleshooting: 11.6.0.12
- The report in question relies on the SharePointSPAA System Scan and SharePointSPAA Bulk Import processes.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the current version of AIC (11.6.0.12).
2. Upgraded AIC to version 11.6.0.21 to rule out any recently fixed bugs.
3. Rebound to port 481.
4. Restarted the Netwrix AIC Service.
5. Reviewed logs to identify the cause of the error when loading the permissions report.

## Root Cause
The permissions report that the customer was trying to access relied on the SPAA_PermissionsView, which was not created because the SharePointSPAA processes were not currently running. This absence of the required view led to the 500 status error.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading the Netwrix AIC to version 11.6.0.21. After the upgrade, it was confirmed through log analysis that the permissions report was attempting to call a view that had not been created. The customer was informed that they could proceed without this report as they had not set up the necessary configurations for it.

## Notes
- The customer is currently not set up to utilize the SharePointSPAA features, so the missing report is not an immediate concern.
- Future users encountering similar issues should ensure that all necessary system scans and imports are configured and running to avoid missing views required for reports.
