## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GEJMYIA5
- **Case Number:** 422020
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** TSMC
- **Contact Name:** Support Sphinxtec
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.0.0.95

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue where searching for folder activity details in the Access Information Center (AIC) took over 30 minutes and ultimately returned no results. In contrast, searching for server activity details yielded results without delay.

## Environment Details
- **AIC Version:** 11.0.0.95
- **StealthAUDIT Version:** 11.0 (latest version)
- The customer is using an out-of-support version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and AIC.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed the versions of AIC and StealthAUDIT being used.
2. Attempted to replicate the issue in a lab environment, which produced the same results.
3. Reviewed the scan summary and scan history data, which were not displayed on the AIC console.
4. Discussed the issue in a SWAT meeting to gather insights and potential solutions.
5. Investigated SQL server connectivity issues that might affect data retrieval.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as the lack of an indexing method in the current versions of NEA and AIC. The absence of proper indexing led to inefficient querying of folder activity details, resulting in timeouts and no results being returned.

## Solution
The development team recommended upgrading to the latest versions of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Access Information Center. The newer versions include an indexing method that significantly improves the efficiency of database queries, allowing for timely retrieval of folder activity details.

## Notes
- The customer is currently using an unsupported version of NEA and AIC, which may expose them to additional risks and limitations.
- It is crucial for customers to keep their software updated to benefit from performance improvements and new features.
- If the issue arises again after upgrading, the incident can be reopened within 30 days; otherwise, a new ticket must be created for further assistance.
