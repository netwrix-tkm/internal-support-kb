## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OLhH8IAL
- **Case Number:** 442857
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** IBM - Etihad Airways
- **Contact Name:** Praveen Huilgol
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The Access Information Center (AIC) console was not functioning as expected. Users could only see reports but not the folders and their permissions, receiving an error message stating "Page can't be displayed."

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Build Number:** 11.5.0.230
- The AIC was configured to operate over HTTPS on port 443.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Confirmed that the SSL certificate for AIC had expired and was replaced.
2. Reviewed the configuration settings in `webservice.config` and `web.config`.
3. Checked the IIS bindings for port 443 and found no SSL certificate assigned.
4. Shared knowledge base articles related to securing the Reporting Module and AIC for HTTPS.
5. Attempted to access the AIC console and confirmed the error PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.

## Root Cause
The AIC was configured to use HTTPS on port 443, but there was no SSL certificate assigned to that port in IIS, leading to the connection reset error.

## Solution
1. Assigned a valid SSL certificate to the IIS bindings for port 443.
2. Configured the Reporting Module and Access Information Center to operate on port 8082 to avoid conflicts.
3. Verified that the AIC console was accessible after the changes.

## Notes
- Ensure that SSL certificates are renewed and properly assigned to the relevant ports in IIS to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the configuration settings in both `webservice.config` and `web.config` after any changes to SSL settings.
