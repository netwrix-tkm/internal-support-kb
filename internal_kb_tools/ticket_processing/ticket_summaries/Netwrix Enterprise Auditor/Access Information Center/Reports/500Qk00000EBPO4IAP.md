- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** KPMG Management Services LP
- **Contact Name:** Jason Skidmore
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with exporting reports from the Access Information Center (AIC). Specifically, they were unable to view or download a large report (700k+ rows) for a specific security group, encountering limitations that prevented them from accessing all necessary data.

## Environment Details
- The AIC is a 32-bit process with a maximum usable memory of 2GB.
- The practical limit for Excel reports is 64k rows.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified that pop-ups were enabled in the browser to allow downloads.
2. Attempted to download the report in both Excel and CSV formats.
3. Increased the `MaxRowCount` in the `AccessInformationCenter.service.exe.config` to 1,000,000.
4. Checked the event viewer and available disk space on the AIC application server.
5. Confirmed that other reports downloaded successfully without issues.
6. Investigated logs for errors related to report generation and download failures.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product limitation due to the AIC being a 32-bit application, which restricts memory usage to 2GB. This limitation results in an inability to handle large Excel reports, leading to out-of-memory errors. Additionally, the CSV download attempts resulted in unauthorized access exceptions.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Allowing browser pop-ups to enable report downloads.
- Advising the customer to download large reports in CSV format instead of Excel, as the AIC can handle CSV files better due to the row limitations of Excel.

## Notes
- For future reference, it is important to note that large reports (over 64k rows) should be exported in CSV format to avoid memory issues associated with Excel.
- Consider advising customers to filter reports by server or other criteria to reduce the number of rows and improve performance when dealing with large datasets.
