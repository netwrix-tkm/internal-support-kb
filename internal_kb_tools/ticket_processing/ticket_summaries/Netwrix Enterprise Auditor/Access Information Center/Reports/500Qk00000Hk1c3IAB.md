- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer inquired whether Microsoft Silverlight is still required for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6. If it is no longer needed, they requested guidance on removing Silverlight version 5.1.50918.0.

## Environment Details
- **Product Versions:** StealthAUDIT 11.5 and greater, Access Information Center 11.5 and greater
- **Dependency:** Microsoft Silverlight

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed product documentation regarding dependencies for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and related components.
2. Confirmed that StealthAUDIT 11.5 and greater does not depend on Silverlight.
3. Verified that Access Information Center 11.5 and greater (an add-on to StealthAUDIT) also does not require Silverlight.

## Root Cause
The inquiry stemmed from a misunderstanding regarding the dependency of Silverlight on the newer versions of Netwrix products. It was confirmed that Silverlight is not required for versions 11.5 and above.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming to the customer that Microsoft Silverlight is not required for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6 or any of its components (StealthAUDIT and Access Information Center). The customer was advised that they could safely remove Silverlight version 5.1.50918.0 from their environment.

## Notes
- Customers using versions 11.5 and greater of StealthAUDIT and Access Information Center can safely uninstall Silverlight without impacting functionality.
- It is recommended to keep documentation updated regarding software dependencies to prevent similar inquiries in the future.
