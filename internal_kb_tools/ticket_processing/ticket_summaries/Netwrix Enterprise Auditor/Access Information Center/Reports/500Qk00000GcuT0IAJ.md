- **Contact Name:** Geethika Alakam

- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Reports
- **Version:** 11.0

## Problem Description
The owner of a shared folder was unable to import a list of user IDs from an Excel sheet into the self-service portal. An error message appeared stating, "Some users could not be found." When attempting to view the missing users for removal, the resulting window displayed an unreadable format.

## Environment Details
- **Build Number:** 11.0.0.250
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the format of the file being imported.
2. Attempted to import the Excel file multiple times to replicate the issue.
3. Checked for any updates or patches related to the import functionality.
4. Reviewed the error message and attempted to access the list of missing users.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the attempt to import user data from an unsupported file format. The self-service portal only supports CSV files for user imports, while the customer was using an Excel format.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that only CSV format is supported for user imports. The customer was advised to convert the Excel file to CSV format and then attempt the import again.

## Notes
- Ensure that users are aware of the supported file formats for imports to prevent similar issues in the future.
- It may be beneficial to include a warning or note in the user interface of the self-service portal regarding supported file formats to enhance user experience.
