- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** USAA
- **Contact Name:** Rich Harbaugh
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Review
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Access Information Center (AIC) was not displaying several network shares that were required for an upcoming annual Windows share review. The shares were essential for the access review scheduled to launch on June 11, 2025.

## Environment Details
- The shares in question were identified as DFS (Distributed File System) shares.
- The installation of StealthAUDIT AIC was being used to manage and audit these shares.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Started the AIC application.
2. Navigated to the File Shares section to check for missing shares.
3. Investigated potential issues related to scan/bulk import settings or scoping that might exclude the shares.
4. Discovered that all DFS jobs had been disabled and had not been running since October 2024.
5. Enabled the DFS jobs and initiated job 1 to enumerate the shares.
6. Started the full job group to ensure all shares were scanned and imported correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the DFS scans being disabled in the Netwrix Access Auditor (NAA), which resulted in the missing shares not being populated in the AIC database.

## Solution
The resolution involved the following steps:
- Enabled the previously disabled DFS jobs in the NAA.
- Ran the file share access audit (FSAA) scan and bulk import jobs.
- Validated that the missing shares were now correctly populated and displayed in the AIC.

## Notes
- Ensure that DFS jobs are enabled and running regularly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Regularly check the configuration settings of the AIC to confirm that all necessary scans are active, especially before critical audits or reviews.
