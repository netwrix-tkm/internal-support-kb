## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000FFxS9IAL
- **Case Number:** 419830
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** RKW SE
- **Contact Name:** Sean Hanrahan
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Review
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported that a user, who is a member of multiple groups in the Access Information Center (AIC), could only see servers associated with the first group and not the servers from other groups. The customer inquired if there were any restrictions causing this behavior.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.6
- **Feature in Use:** Resource Review

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the group permissions and access settings for the user in question.
2. Checked if other users in multiple groups experienced similar access limitations.
3. Investigated potential documentation regarding group access restrictions and least privilege principles.
4. Attempted to replicate the issue with another user who is a member of multiple groups.

## Root Cause
The behavior observed was confirmed to be working as intended by the development team. The issue stemmed from the least privilege principle applied within the AIC, which restricts access based on the highest level of permissions granted to the user across their groups.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the system's behavior was intentional and aligned with the least privilege access model. No changes were necessary, as the userâ€™s access was functioning correctly according to the defined permissions.

## Notes
- Users should be aware that when assigned to multiple groups, access may be limited to the permissions of the highest priority group, which can lead to confusion if not properly documented.
- It is recommended to review group permissions regularly to ensure users have the appropriate access based on their roles and responsibilities.
