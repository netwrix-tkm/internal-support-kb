## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000K9jCAIAZ
- **Case Number:** 431075
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Bremer Bank
- **Contact Name:** Leslie Lange
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Resource Review
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer requested to allow the Reader Role access to view Azure RBAC, Office 365, and SQL Server within the Resource Audit page of the Access Information Center (AIC). The current configuration only permitted access to File System, SharePoint, and Active Directory.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Product Version:** 11.6

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the current permissions available in the AIC for the Reader Role.
2. Provided guidance on using the "Allow access to the following servers" feature to customize permissions.
3. Awaited customer feedback on the application of the suggested settings.

## Root Cause
The limitation was due to the default configuration of the AIC, which only included basic checkboxes for certain resources, restricting the Reader Role from accessing additional cloud resources.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by instructing the customer to specify the tenant name instead of the server when configuring permissions. This allowed the customer to build custom permissions for cloud resources, thereby granting the Reader Role access to Azure RBAC, Office 365, and SQL Server.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the ability to customize permissions beyond the default options in the AIC.
- Future requests for similar access configurations should consider specifying tenant names for cloud resources to avoid similar limitations.
