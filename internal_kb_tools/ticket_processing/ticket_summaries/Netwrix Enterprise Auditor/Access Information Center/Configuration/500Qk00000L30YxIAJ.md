## Problem Description
The customer reported that the X-Content-Type-Options HTTP header was not disabled in the AIC 11.5 version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Impact:** HTTP headers that should be included by default were missing, potentially exposing the application to security risks.

2. Reviewed the default security settings for HTTP headers in the application.
3. Consulted industry standards and best practices for secure HTTP headers.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect in version 11.5 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, where the X-Content-Type-Options header was not included by default.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6 or later, which includes the fix to ensure that the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header is added by default to the web server response headers.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always verify the presence of security-related HTTP headers in web applications.
- Future deployments should ensure that the latest version of the software is used to avoid similar security issues.
