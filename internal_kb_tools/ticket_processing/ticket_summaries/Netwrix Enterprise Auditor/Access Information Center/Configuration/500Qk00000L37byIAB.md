## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L37byIAB
- **Case Number:** 433567
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Catharine Coleman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the Content Security Policy (CSP) was not implemented in the Access Information Center (AIC) version 11.5, which posed a security risk allowing attackers to execute cross-domain scripts and potentially perform attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Environment Details
- **Affected Version:** AIC 11.5
- **Recommended Version for Fix:** 11.6+

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the response headers for the presence of the Content-Security-Policy (CSP).
2. Recommended enabling CSP by sending the appropriate HTTP response headers.
3. Suggested implementing the CSP header with the following example:
   ```http
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
   ```
   or using a meta tag:
   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self';">
   ```
4. Advised applying the whitelist and policies as strictly as possible.
5. Escalated the issue to Research and Development (R&D) for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a product defect in version 11.5 of the AIC, where the Content-Security-Policy header was not included in the HTTP response headers.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by confirming that the "Content-Security-Policy" security header was added to both the AIC and the web server in version 11.6 and later. Customers were advised to upgrade to this version to ensure the implementation of CSP.

## Notes
- It is crucial for future implementations to ensure that CSP is enabled to mitigate security risks associated with cross-domain scripting.
- Always verify the response headers after updates to confirm that security policies are correctly applied.
