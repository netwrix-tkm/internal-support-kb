- **Case Number:** 433539
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Catharine Coleman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a security vulnerability related to clickjacking, an attack that exploits browser bugs to capture sensitive information from legitimate users of the application. The attacker manipulates the browser to navigate users to a malicious web page that loads a third-party page in an HTML frame, allowing JavaScript on the attacker's page to steal data.

## Environment Details
- The issue was identified in versions prior to 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the reported clickjacking vulnerability and its implications.
2. Investigated the behavior of the application in various browsers to confirm the presence of the vulnerability.
3. Checked the application configuration and dependencies on IIS.
4. Verified if the issue persisted in the latest version of the software.

## Root Cause
The clickjacking vulnerability was due to a dependency on Internet Information Services (IIS) in versions prior to 11.6, which allowed the exploitation of browser bugs.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by upgrading to version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. In this version, the application no longer depends on IIS, effectively mitigating the clickjacking vulnerability.

## Notes
- Users are advised to upgrade to version 11.6 or later to avoid similar security vulnerabilities.
- Continuous monitoring of security concerns is recommended to ensure the application remains secure against emerging threats.
