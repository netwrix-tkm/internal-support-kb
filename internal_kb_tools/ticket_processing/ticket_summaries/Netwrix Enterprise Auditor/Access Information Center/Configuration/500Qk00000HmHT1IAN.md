## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000HmHT1IAN
- **Case Number:** 425827
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** International Motors, LLC
- **Contact Name:** William Dammeier
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The Access Information Center (AIC) service was unable to bind to any port, appearing stuck and requiring a taskkill command to restart. The service was not starting properly, leading to timeout issues.

## Environment Details
- The AIC was bound to port 481 using the same certificate as the Published Reports.
- The server had a large Active Directory (AD) inventory with over 338,000 users.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Attempted to bind the AIC to port 481 with the existing certificate.
2. Restarted the AIC service, which failed to start due to a timeout.
3. Rebooted the server, which allowed the AIC service to run.
4. Investigated the Active Directory Inventory (ADI) scan, which was erroring and causing "Unable to enumerate domain" errors in the AIC log.
5. Changed the ADI scan to use a different Domain Controller (DC) to resolve LDAP errors.

## Root Cause
The AIC service was unable to bind to the port due to a misconfiguration and potential conflicts with the ADI scan, which was not functioning correctly and causing service timeouts.

## Solution
1. Imported the certificate to the local machine store.
2. Executed the following command in Admin PowerShell ISE to bind the certificate:
   ```powershell
   $guid = "bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8" 
   $certHash = "%new_thumbprint_value%" # the 'Thumbprint' value 
   $ip = "0.0.0.0" # this means all IP addresses 
   $port = "481" # the default HTTPS port 
   "http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}" | netsh 
   ```
3. Adjusted the "BindingURL" value to "https://+481" in the configuration file located at `%Program Files%STEALTHbitsAccess Information CenterAccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config`.
4. Restarted the Netwrix Access Information Center service in Windows Services.

## Notes
- Ensure that the ADI scan is functioning correctly to avoid similar issues in the future.
- Monitor the service after configuration changes to confirm that it starts without errors.
- Consider the impact of large user inventories on service performance and scanning times.
