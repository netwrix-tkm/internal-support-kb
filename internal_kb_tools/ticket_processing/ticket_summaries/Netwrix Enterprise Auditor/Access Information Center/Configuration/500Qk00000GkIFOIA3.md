## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000GkIFOIA3
- **Case Number:** 423193
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.
- **Contact Name:** Connie Liang
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message stating "Sorry we are unable to complete this request right now" when attempting to add or remove computers from specific Active Directory (AD) groups using the Access Information Center (AIC). The groups affected were identified as:
- APCarbon Black Migration
- EUEU Carbon Black Migration
- USECarbon Black Migration
- USWCarbon Black Migration

The customer was able to modify other AD groups without issue, and the service account credentials worked correctly when using Active Directory Users and Computers.

## Environment Details
- **Service Account:** Used for AIC operations
- **AD Group Types:** The failing groups were identified as global groups, while the working groups were universal.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the error logs from AIC, which indicated a permissions issue when trying to add users to the failing groups.
2. Verified that the service account had sufficient privileges by testing modifications in Active Directory Users and Computers.
3. Suggested the customer create a test global group to replicate the issue and attempt to add users to it.
4. Advised converting the test group to a universal group to see if the issue persisted.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as insufficient permissions for the service account being used by AIC to modify the specific global AD groups.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the permissions for the service account were updated according to the documentation provided by Netwrix. This ensured that the service account had the minimum required permissions to make modifications to the AD groups in question. The relevant documentation can be found at:
[Netwrix AIC Permissions Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/AdditionalConfig/CommitChanges.htm)

## Notes
- Ensure that service accounts have the appropriate permissions for the types of AD groups they need to modify, especially when dealing with global vs. universal groups.
- Regularly review and update permissions as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
