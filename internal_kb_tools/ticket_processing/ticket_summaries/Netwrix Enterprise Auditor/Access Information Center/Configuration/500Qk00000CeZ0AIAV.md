## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000CeZ0AIAV
- **Case Number:** 414022
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** CPP Corp
- **Contact Name:** Benjamin Tanner
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported an error message "unable to validate your session" when attempting to access the "Access" tab in the Stealth Audit web interface from a remote machine. The issue did not occur when accessing the same tab directly from the Stealth Bits server.

## Environment Details
- The issue was specifically related to the Published Reports site on port 8082 and the Access Information Center on port 481.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. The support team requested details about the installed software using a PowerShell command.
2. The customer was asked when the issue started and if it had worked previously.
3. Clarification was sought on whether the issue occurred when accessing the Access Information Center (AIC) directly from a remote computer.
4. The customer was instructed to provide AIC logs for further investigation.
5. A remote session was scheduled to diagnose the issue in detail.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as an invalid certificate bound to ports 8082 (Published Reports) and 481 (Access Information Center).

## Solution
The immediate workaround was to access the AIC directly via the URL `https://+:481`. The customer was advised to obtain a new certificate and follow the instructions provided in the Netwrix knowledge base article to update the certificates bound to both ports 8082 and 481. This update would restore functionality to the Access tab.

## Notes
- Ensure that certificates are regularly updated to prevent similar issues in the future.
- The customer was informed that they would receive an automated confirmation of case closure and the option to reopen the case if related issues arise.
