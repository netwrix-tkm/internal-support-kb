## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000L34FxIAJ
- **Case Number:** 433564
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Catharine Coleman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the application was missing the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, which is essential for enforcing secure connections over HTTPS.

## Environment Details
- Affected Version: AIC 11.5.0.137
- HSTS is required to ensure all HTTP requests are forced over HTTPS.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the response headers of the application to check for the presence of the Strict Transport Security header.
2. Reviewed the web.config file for the AIC to identify if the rewrite section was uncommented.
3. Consulted past support ticket #368629 for additional context and guidance.
4. Escalated the issue to the R&D team for further investigation.

## Root Cause
The absence of the HSTS header was identified as a product defect in the AIC version 11.5. The issue stemmed from the configuration settings in the web.config file, which did not have the necessary rewrite rules enabled.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by updating the AIC to version 11.6 or higher, or the Webserver to version 11.0 or higher. These versions automatically include the "Strict-Transport-Security" header in the response when SSL is enabled. The necessary changes in the web.config file involve uncommenting the rewrite section, specifically lines 270 through 296 for AIC version 11.5.0.137.

## Notes
- Ensure that the web.config file is properly configured to include the rewrite rules for HSTS in future deployments.
- For any similar issues, check if the application is running on the latest version of AIC or Webserver, as updates may include critical security headers by default.
- Documentation regarding the changes and updates related to HSTS should be reviewed and updated as necessary to prevent future occurrences.
