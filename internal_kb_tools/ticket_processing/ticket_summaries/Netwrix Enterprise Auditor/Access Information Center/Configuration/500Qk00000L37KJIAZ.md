- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Netwrix Technical Support
- **Contact Name:** Catharine Coleman
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer reported a security vulnerability in version 11.5 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, specifically the absence of the security header "X-Frame Options." This vulnerability could allow attackers to perform clickjacking and phishing attacks, potentially compromising users' sensitive information.

## Environment Details
- **Affected Version:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.5
- **Security Concern:** Missing Security Header X-Frame Options

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the response headers of the application for the presence of "X-Frame Options."
2. Recommended implementing "X-Frame Options: SAMEORIGIN" to restrict framing to pages from the same origin.
3. Escalated the issue to the R&D team for further investigation and resolution.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a product defect in version 11.5 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which did not include the necessary security header "X-Frame Options."

## Solution
The issue was resolved in version 11.6 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, where the "X-Frame Options" header was implemented correctly. Users are advised to upgrade to version 11.6 or later to mitigate the security vulnerability.

## Notes
- It is recommended to always implement security best practices, including the use of "X-Frame Options" and Content Security Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors, to protect against clickjacking and other security threats.
- For future reference, ensure that all security headers are properly configured in web applications to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
