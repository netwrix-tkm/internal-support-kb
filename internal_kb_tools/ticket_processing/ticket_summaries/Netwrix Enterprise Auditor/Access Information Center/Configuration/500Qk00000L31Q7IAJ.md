## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue regarding the absence of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for their system, which is a security measure requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification to authenticate.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Issue Type:** Third-party system failure

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the MFA requirements and functionality within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
2. Investigated the integration with third-party systems to determine if MFA was supported.
3. Consulted documentation related to MFA and Single Sign-On (SSO) configurations.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a failure in the third-party system integration that supports MFA. It was determined that MFA is supported via SSO, which was not properly configured in the customer's environment.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by directing the customer to the relevant documentation that outlines how to configure MFA through SSO. The specific resource provided was:

This documentation includes steps for setting up MFA with Okta, ensuring that the customer could implement the necessary configurations.

## Notes
- Ensure that customers are aware of the need for proper configuration of third-party systems to utilize MFA effectively.
- Recommend regular reviews of security settings and integrations to prevent similar issues in the future.
