## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000OgY7VIAV
- **Case Number:** 443831
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Oak Hill Advisors
- **Contact Name:** Douglas Kupcha
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported an issue with auditing folder rename actions. While the Activity Monitor displayed both the old and new folder names after a rename event, the Access Information Center (AIC) only showed the old folder name, along with the time, date, and user details. The customer expressed concern about the retention period of 21 days in the Activity Monitor, questioning how to retrieve complete rename details if the event occurred outside this timeframe.

## Environment Details
- **Retention Period:** 21 days for events in the Activity Monitor
- **Platforms Used:** Activity Monitor and Access Information Center

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the rename event in the Activity Monitor, confirming it displayed both the old and new folder names.
2. Checked the AIC under Resource Audit for the same rename event, which only showed the old name.
3. Discussed the implications of the 21-day retention period for the Activity Monitor and the need for complete details in the AIC.

## Root Cause
The issue was identified as a product defect where the AIC did not display the new folder name after a rename event, limiting the information available for auditing purposes.

## Solution
To resolve the issue, the technician guided the customer to add the "Destination" column in the AIC. This was done by left-clicking on the Path and selecting the Destination path, which allowed the new folder name to be displayed alongside the old name.

## Notes
- It is important to remind users that the AIC may not show complete rename details by default. Users should be instructed on how to customize their views to include necessary information.
- Future audits should consider the limitations of the retention period in the Activity Monitor and the potential need for additional logging or reporting mechanisms to capture critical events beyond this timeframe.
