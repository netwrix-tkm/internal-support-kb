## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000LkQl4IAF
- **Case Number:** 435434
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** Oak Hill Advisors
- **Contact Name:** Douglas Kupcha
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6

## Problem Description
The customer reported a limitation in the resource audit section of the Access Information Center (AIC), where only 100,000 rows could be displayed in the activity details pane. They requested a way to extend this limit to export a complete report of all events, noting that filtering options caused the export functionality to disappear.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** Access Information Center

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified the default configuration settings of the AIC, which were set to a maximum of 100,000 rows.
2. Attempted to save report configurations but found that changes were not being saved due to the layout selection not being completed.
3. Modified the AIC configuration file to increase the row limit.
4. Restarted the AIC service to apply the changes.
5. Ensured that the finish button was selected when exiting the layout options to save report settings.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the default configuration of the AIC, which limited the display to 100,000 rows. Additionally, the failure to save report configurations was due to not selecting the layout before exiting the settings.

## Solution
The resolution involved modifying the AIC configuration file to increase the row limit from 100,000 to 150,000. The configuration file was located at:
```
E:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center\AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config
```
After making the changes, the AIC service was restarted. The issue with saving report settings was resolved by ensuring that the finish button was selected before exiting the layout options.

## Notes
- Future users should be aware that the default row limit can be modified in the configuration file, but changes require a service restart to take effect.
- Always ensure that the layout is selected and the finish button is clicked when saving report configurations to avoid losing changes.
