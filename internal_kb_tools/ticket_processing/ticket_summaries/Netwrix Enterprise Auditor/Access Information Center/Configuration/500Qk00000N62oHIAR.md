## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000N62oHIAR
- **Case Number:** 439304
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** SouthState Bank
- **Contact Name:** Angelia Fogle
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested to add additional access levels for internal audit purposes, specifically to allow users to have view-only access to certain resources without the ability to make changes.

## Environment Details
- **Platform:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Collector Code:** Access Information Center

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Initial communication established with the customer to clarify the access requirements.
2. Scheduled a meeting for March 26th to discuss the access levels in detail.
3. Reviewed the role-based access settings in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor during the meeting.
4. Investigated the possibility of creating custom roles to meet the customer's requirements.
5. Confirmed that existing roles do not support the requested view-only access without also granting modification permissions.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the issue was identified as a limitation in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's Access Information Center, which does not support custom roles. The existing roles that allow viewing of Resource Reviews also grant permissions to create, edit, and delete reviews.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by informing the customer that the desired level of access could not be granted due to the limitations of the current system. A feature request was submitted on behalf of the customer to potentially address this limitation in future updates.

## Notes
- It is important to communicate to customers that the current version of the software may have limitations regarding access control.
- Future requests for similar access configurations should be handled by confirming the capabilities of the existing roles and considering the submission of feature requests for enhancements.
