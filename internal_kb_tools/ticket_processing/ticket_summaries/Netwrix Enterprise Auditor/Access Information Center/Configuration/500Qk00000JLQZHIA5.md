## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000JLQZHIA5
- **Case Number:** 429473
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** ConocoPhillips Company
- **Contact Name:** Frank McNickle
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.5

## Problem Description
The customer requested assistance in configuring SSL access for the Access Information Center (AIC) in StealthAUDIT version 11.5.

## Environment Details
- **Product Version:** 11.5
- **Related Components:** NTM Reporting (for NEA/StealthAUDIT), NTM (StealthDEFEND)

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reviewed the SSL configuration requirements as per the documentation provided in the Netwrix Help Center.
2. Attempted to configure SSL access but encountered an error due to an incorrect "certhash" value.
3. Identified the error message from the `netsh` command: "The parameter is incorrect."
4. Investigated the "certhash" parameter for any discrepancies.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an extra character in the "certhash" value, which led to the `netsh` command failing to recognize the parameter as valid.

## Solution
- Corrected the "certhash" value by removing the extra character.
- Successfully configured SSL access to AIC, which resolved the "Not Secure" message by creating a valid certificate that matched the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
- Advised the customer to contact their IT department or security team to obtain a proper certificate from their internal certificate authority for future configurations.

## Notes
- Ensure that the "certhash" value is verified for accuracy before executing the `netsh` command to avoid similar issues.
- It is recommended to use certificates issued by a trusted internal certificate authority to prevent security warnings when accessing AIC.
