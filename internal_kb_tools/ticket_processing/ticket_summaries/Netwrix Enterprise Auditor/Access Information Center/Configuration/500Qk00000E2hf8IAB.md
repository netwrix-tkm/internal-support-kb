## Ticket Metadata
- **Ticket ID:** 500Qk00000E2hf8IAB
- **Case Number:** 417124
- **Status:** Closed - Resolved
- **Account/Company:** MISO Energy
- **Contact Name:** Patrick Sager
- **Product:** Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
- **Component:** Access Information Center
- **Feature:** Configuration
- **Version:** 11.6.0.75

## Problem Description
The customer reported that the StealthAudit application was keeping port 80 in use on their Windows server. They sought confirmation on whether any other jobs or functionalities required port 80 and requested guidance on disabling its use entirely, as their Cyber Security team wanted to shut down the port.

## Environment Details
- **Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA):** 11.6.0.75
- **Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC):** 11.6.0.14
- The server was running IIS, which was no longer utilized.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Checked the current version of the StealthAudit applications running in the environment.
2. Used the following commands to investigate port usage:
   - `netstat -abno | Select-String 80`
   - `Get-Process -pid ####`
   - `Get-Service -DisplayName *web* | FT -AutoSize`
   - `Get-Service -DisplayName *iis*`
   - `iisreset /status`
3. Confirmed that port 80 was linked to the no longer utilized IIS.
4. Removed the default web page from the IIS manager.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the IIS service, which was still configured to use port 80 despite being no longer utilized. This configuration led to the port remaining in use by the StealthAudit application.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:
- Identifying that port 80 was associated with the IIS service.
- Removing the default web page from the IIS manager, effectively freeing up port 80.
- Ensuring that no other applications or services required port 80 for their operations.

## Notes
- It is important to verify the necessity of any ports before disabling them, especially in environments where multiple applications may be running.
- Future configurations should ensure that unused services like IIS are properly disabled or uninstalled to prevent similar issues.
