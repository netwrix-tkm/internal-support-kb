"500Qk00000CsrjZIAR","00414616","Support Ticket","ADV-2024-002 Questions","Hello - Given the update to the security advisory ADV-2024-002 - Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify, I want to make sure our server has been upgraded to the correct version. We have a hosted environment and it is still running 5.9.2.0, additionally, our clients are running on 6.2.1.2. (second screenshot) I want to make sure the most recent patches were applied and if there is anything further needed on our end. 

Additionally, I am finding that in the reports/analysis>Content Aware Report, some events are capturing the wrong computer/user combination (first screenshot attached). For example, an event listed under my computer name (OMI-GCHILIGIRIS), is showing the username RaphelinaDeleon. Since Raphelina Deleon triggered this event, it should capture that her computer (OMI-RDLEON) was associated with the event, not my computer. This started happening after the latest hotfix. Please advise.","","","","The update was applied","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts - Other","","","64.0","Closed - Resolved","Outcomes Matter Innovations","George Chiligiris","2024-07-10T12:43:36.000Z","2024-09-12T13:07:04.000Z"
