"500Qk00000LXfQ5IAL","00434823","Support Ticket","[Bank Aladin] Email Alert not Received by Customer from Endpoint Protector Server","Hi Support,

Our customer is not receiving email alerts from their Endpoint Protector Server for the Device Control and Content Aware Report since 25/01/2025.

We have verified that there are no configuration changes in the SMTP settings and Alert configuration that previously worked. Additionally, we conducted a manual test by sending an email from the EPP server  E-mail setting to the customer's admin, and the test email was successfully received.

Given the customer's concern regarding this issue, could we schedule a remote session on Monday, 10 February, at 2 PM Indonesia time to further investigate?

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,","","SMTP settings are fine. (Test email is going through)
