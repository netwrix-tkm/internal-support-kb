@Botond-Robert Biro, please follow the next steps:



	 - 	 Check if the SMTP config is set properly; (Recheck the Test email, save the settings, and ask the customer to check if he received the test email);

	 - 	 If the customer doesn't receive the test email, delete the SMT config (empty all the fields and save it), and configure the email again.
	 - 	Check again if the email test was sent. If yes, you can go to the next steps.
	 - 	Regenerate the alerts cache;

	 - 	 login to MySQL

	 - 	drop table old_alert;
	 - 	drop table old_cf_alert;
	 - 	run the cron to regenerate the alert cache: php /opt/eppworker/build_alerts_cache.php
	 - 	 Check the size of the mailer

	 - 	du -sh /var/eppfiles/exports/

	 - 	If the mailer directory size is big, clear it.

	 - 	How to clear:

	 - 	stop the services:

	 - 	service cron stop
	 - 	service nginx stop
	 - 	service php-fpm stop
	 - 	rm -rf /var/eppfiles/mailer/*
	 - 	Login to MySQL and empty the mailer table:

	 - 	DELETE FROM mailer;
	 - 	Start the services:

	 - 	service cron start
	 - 	service nginx start
	 - 	service php-fpm start

Hi, 

Alerts have been set up for the 'File Copy' event on USB storage devices and internal CD/DVD drives. However, the export logs indicate that the 'File Copy' event occurred on a 'Network Share' instead.

A similar issue exists with the 'File Read' event, where no events are being generated, meaning no alerts will be triggered.


It seems that the alerts may not be set up correctly on the customer's side. Please conduct some tests with the customer for the defined events and device types to ensure the alerts are functioning properly.

Additionally, kindly confirm if the SMTP service is working correctly.

Regards, 

Augustina
