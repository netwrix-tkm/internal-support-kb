As explained during the remote session, the reason for which you should use the export as a .csv button from the bottom of the screen of the Reporting instead of the PDF is the following:

1) The PDF button will export only the logs which are displayed on the page and not the entire list of logs that you filtered for;
2) A second reason and more important would be the fact that when you filter for so many results of logs (thousands) these should be exported as .csv due to the structure of that file type which permits a high number of lines written inside, while the .pdf are designed more for documents not for logs.
