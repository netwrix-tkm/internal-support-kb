When using the credentials, did you use your account password or did you use an app password?
For Gmail to work correctly you need to set up 2-factor authentication and create an app password to use on the server. This is a requirement from Google.
Can you please try it and let me know the outcome?

Hi Olivier,

When using the credentials, did you use your account password or did you use an app password?
For Gmail to work correctly you need to set up 2-factor authentication and create an app password to use on the server. This is a requirement from Google.
Can you please try it and let me know the outcome?

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Mo1U9:ref
 

Hello,

 

Thank you for your reply.

 

- What is the impact of the issue on your business?

I am unable to use the DLP solution as it does not produce alerts.
- What are the steps to reproduce?


Test email does not get sent.
- Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried?

Tried switching multiple ports and switching from SSL to TLS and vice-versa.
- When did this issue start?

Since the start of using the tool.
- Can you please let me know the Server version (if not already known) on which the issue is encountered?

Version 5.9.4.1

- On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, GCP, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS)

Hosted by EPP
- If you have not, can you provide screen shots of the smtp configuration?


 

 

Kind Regards,
