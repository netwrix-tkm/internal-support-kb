We cleared the alerts cache and then did a rebuilt of the alerts cache via the Endpoint Protector Server's backend.
We checked the configurations of the Alerts, and then selected the customer's administrator profile in the alerts.
The customer set their custom no reply email in the SMTP configuration and sent a test email, the test email was received.
We then set a Deny right for the USB storage device type on the customer's endpoint computer.
We tested the scenario of Alerts by connecting a USB storage device to the customer's endpoint computer
We observed that the Alerts started to work as expected and the alerts were received into the customer's email Inbox
The issue was resolved in today's remote session.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-20T16:38:13.000Z"
