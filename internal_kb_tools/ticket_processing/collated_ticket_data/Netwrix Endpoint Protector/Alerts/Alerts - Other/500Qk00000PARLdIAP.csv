We swtiched to cloud hosted earlier this year and it worked then.   I just checked the alert history, there are none. See screenshot.  I went to the mail set up and sent a test email.  that worked fine.  And then we started getting random email alerts of the kind we should have been getting all along. The alerts are from April.","","We updated some alerts that were stuck in processing and deleted + rebuilt the alert cache. The alerts should be working now.
