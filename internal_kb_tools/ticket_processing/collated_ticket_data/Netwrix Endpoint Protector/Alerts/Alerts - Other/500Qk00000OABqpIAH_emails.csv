I’m Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I’ve been assigned to your case. Thank you for confirming that the new license appears to be applied under System Configuration → System Licensing → Licensing Status, showing an end date of April 19, 2028.

Hi Ramon,

Thanks for the follow up. We have not rebooted since importing the licenses, and I’ve attached a screenshot of the system licensing page.

I’ve scheduled a server reboot after hours today at 7pm PST. We have been receiving the license renewal notice email at 8am PST, so we will know whether this resolve the issue tomorrow morning, and I will follow up then.

Best,

Hi Ramon,

I rebooted the server last night, and we received another email for the license renewal this morning. I’ve attached another screenshot of the System License page after the reboot. How else can we avoid this notice email from being incorrectly sent out?

Best,

Hello Tyler,

I’m Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I’ve been assigned to your case. Thank you for confirming that the new license appears to be applied under System Configuration → System Licensing → Licensing Status, showing an end date of April 19, 2028. Could you please provide a screenshot of this page?

This issue often relates to a cron job that automatically updates the licensing status. If you have already rebooted the EPP Appliance, does the renewal notice still appear? If so, I would appreciate another screenshot of the Licensing Status page after the reboot.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Tyler,

Thank you for confirming the updated EPP license, which now reflects an expiration date in 2028, and that you are still receiving notifications about a required license change. Please rest assured that you have a 30-day grace period if, for any reason, the new license has not fully taken effect.

I’d like to schedule a remote session on Friday, April 25, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST to verify your configuration and ensure everything is operating correctly. Please let me know if this time works for you. I will be out of the office until April 23, but I will be available on Friday.

Thank you, and I look forward to assisting you further.

Hi Ramon,

11 AM CST doesn’t fit in my schedule today. I’m available in the afternoon hours on Pacific Standard Time, not Central Time, being from 1pm to 5pm PST.

In any case, we haven’t continued to receive the notification emails for the licensing since Sunday, where we received a final Default System Alert noting “Your Updates and Support has expired.” The System Licensing page still lists the correct end date of 2028, so do we have any reason for any additional concern?

Unless there are additional checks necessary beyond the License End Date being listed correctly, I would feel comfortable skipping the remote session as we are no longer incorrectly receiving the license expiration emails.

Best,

Hi Ramon,

I rebooted the server last night, and we received another email for the license renewal this morning. I’ve attached another screenshot of the System License page after the reboot. How else can we avoid this notice email from being incorrectly sent out?

Best,

Hello Tyler,

I’m Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I’ve been assigned to your case. Thank you for confirming that the new license appears to be applied under System Configuration → System Licensing → Licensing Status, showing an end date of April 19, 2028. Could you please provide a screenshot of this page?

This issue often relates to a cron job that automatically updates the licensing status. If you have already rebooted the EPP Appliance, does the renewal notice still appear? If so, I would appreciate another screenshot of the Licensing Status page after the reboot.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Since we've confirmed from the EPP UI licensing page that the license does not expire until 2028 and you are no longer receiving warning emails, there is no reason for concern.

The purpose of the remote session was to verify the license expiration date from the backend if the email warnings continued. I was also prepared to re-import the license and restart the EPP Appliance in case the emails persisted or if there was a discrepancy with the expiration date. However, as you are no longer receiving these emails and the license appears correct in the EPP UI, no further action is needed.

We can close this case, and if you encounter any further issues, it can be reopened. I will ensure to schedule any future remote sessions according to Pacific Time (1pm to 5pm PST).

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or if you would like me to proceed with closing this case.

Thank you.
Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ramon, 

 

11 AM CST doesn’t fit in my schedule today. I’m available in the afternoon hours on Pacific Standard Time, not Central Time, being from 1pm to 5pm PST. 

 

In any case, we haven’t continued to receive the notification emails for the licensing since Sunday, where we received a final Default System Alert noting “Your Updates and Support has expired.” The System Licensing page still lists the correct end date of 2028, so do we have any reason for any additional concern? 

 

Unless there are additional checks necessary beyond the License End Date being listed correctly, I would feel comfortable skipping the remote session as we are no longer incorrectly receiving the license expiration emails.

 

Best,

Hello Tyler,

Thank you for confirming the updated EPP license, which now reflects an expiration date in 2028, and that you are still receiving notifications about a required license change. Please rest assured that you have a 30-day grace period if, for any reason, the new license has not fully taken effect.

I’d like to schedule a remote session on Friday, April 25, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST to verify your configuration and ensure everything is operating correctly. Please let me know if this time works for you. I will be out of the office until April 23, but I will be available on Friday.
