Hello George,

I will ask you to apply the EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 which should be available in Dashboard -> Live update.
As I could see the hotfix version 1 was applied in 28 June and the hotfix 1.1 was release in July.

Once the patch is applied, please send me a screenshot of the applied updates, in order to confirm.

Thank you,
Emil

The 5.9.3.0 server update is not mandatory, in order to apply the hotfix, as it can be installed on any EPP Server version higher than 5.8.1.0.
If you don't want to update to 5.9.3.0, you can apply just the Hotfix 1.1 and the server should have the vulnerabilities fixed. (Click the tickbox on the left side of the Hotfix 1.1 -> click on Apply updates below the patch name)

If you also want to update to the EPP Server v 5.9.3.0 (which is recommended), I will ask you to apply the 5.9.3.0 update first -> wait until the patch is applied -> refresh the EPP UI -> apply the hotfix 1.1.
I will also recommend to take a snapshot of the EPP Server before you will apply the 5.9.3.0 update.

Best regards,
Emil

In this case you can apply the 5.9.3.0 server update right away.

Hello George,

I did not know that the server is hosted by us.

In this case you can apply the 5.9.3.0 server update right away.
Once the 5.9.3.0 server update is applied, you can apply the hotfix #1.1.

Let me know if everything works as expected after the server is restarted.

Best regards,
Emil

I will update the EPP server to v. 5.9.3.0 as recommended, but how do I take a snapshot of the server before I apply?

Since we are a hosted environment I was under the impression all of this would have been done for us, per the security notice. Please advise.

Hello George,

The 5.9.3.0 server update is not mandatory, in order to apply the hotfix, as it can be installed on any EPP Server version higher than 5.8.1.0.
If you don't want to update to 5.9.3.0, you can apply just the Hotfix 1.1 and the server should have the vulnerabilities fixed. (Click the tickbox on the left side of the Hotfix 1.1 -> click on Apply updates below the patch name)

If you also want to update to the EPP Server v 5.9.3.0 (which is recommended), I will ask you to apply the 5.9.3.0 update first -> wait until the patch is applied -> refresh the EPP UI -> apply the hotfix 1.1.
I will also recommend to take a snapshot of the EPP Server before you will apply the 5.9.3.0 update.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello George,

I will ask you to apply the EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 which should be available in Dashboard -> Live update.
As I could see the hotfix version 1 was applied in 28 June and the hotfix 1.1 was release in July.

Once the patch is applied, please send me a screenshot of the applied updates, in order to confirm.
