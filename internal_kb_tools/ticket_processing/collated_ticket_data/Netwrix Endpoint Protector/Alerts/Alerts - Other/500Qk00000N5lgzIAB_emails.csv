In the meeting we have verified the EPP console and found that the EPP server version is at 5.7.0.0 .

As we discussed we recommend you to upgrade the server to the latest version. Here are the steps that can be use for the upgrade:

	Take a SNAPSHOT from your virtualisation environment
	Login to the EPP UI with and Admin user.
	Navigate to the dashboard menu -> select Live Update
	In the new window click on the Check for Updates
	Under the button you will find the update, check the checkbox next to it and below press the Apply Updates 
	Wait for the progress bar to finish and then refresh the entire tab
	Redo the steps starting with the Snapshot

Once you reach the latest version, please check if the situation persist.
