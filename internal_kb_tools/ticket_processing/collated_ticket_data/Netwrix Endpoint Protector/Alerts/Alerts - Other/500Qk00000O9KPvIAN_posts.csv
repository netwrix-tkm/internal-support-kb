I am writing this email to share an issue that we are encountering in EPP environment. We are not able to block upload over Cloud Drives. I request your help in resolving this issue. Note that all the other policies are working fine. It would be most appreciated if you could assign an engineer for a remote session with us. 

Thanks for your kind support. 

Regards,
Vikram Solanki","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-17T07:01:35.000Z"

In our remote session today we learned that the customer configured DPI Monitored URL Categories, this means that Endpoint Protector enforced the CAP Policy only on the domains included in the URL categories.  We informed the customer that because URL category was enabled the policy was not enforced on other domains.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-17T18:18:57.000Z"
