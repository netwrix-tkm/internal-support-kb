"500Qk00000CLPpMIAX","00413169","Support Ticket","We are not receiving most alerts","We noticed today that we are not seeing any alerts for USB related activity as we previously had.   We have not altered the alerts. The device control alerts are still configured as they were, but no alerts have been coming through, 

we HAVE gotten alerts related to licensing.


I am not sure what i am supposed to select for OS","","","","Took a look over the alerts that you did not receive in your inbox and we at first recreated the ""Artifact Received"" Alert. After that we tried to trigger it and it worked. We then re-created the rest of the Alerts and we asked if you could please try to trigger them on your end to see if they work now.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts - Other","","","152.8","Closed - Resolved","Chapman and Cutler LLP","Veronica Yessa","2024-06-26T20:12:08.000Z","2024-11-26T15:53:03.000Z"
