Our customer is not receiving email alerts from their Endpoint Protector Server for the Device Control and Content Aware Report since 25/01/2025.

We have verified that there are no configuration changes in the SMTP settings and Alert configuration that previously worked. Additionally, we conducted a manual test by sending an email from the EPP server  E-mail setting to the customer's admin, and the test email was successfully received.

Given the customer's concern regarding this issue, could we schedule a remote session on Monday, 10 February, at 2 PM Indonesia time to further investigate?

Thank you for your assistance.
