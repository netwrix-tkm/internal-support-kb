""
I just wanted to reach out today to see if you, or someone in your organization, could advise if there is a method within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Appliance running version 5.9.4.0 for setting up an alert when a file hash on a file that is located on an internal hard drive is changed. At current we see many different alerts we can create, but don’t appear to see an option for a file hash modification. Additionally, with the File Hashes option enabled on the appliance, the only files we are seeing hashes generated for are those associated with a removable storage device, is it possible to have hashes generated for files located on Network Shares and internal storage?
""
We tried to enable file Hash from the Global Settings, but this did not return anything on the customer side when logs were generated.","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-01-13T20:19:01.000Z"
