"500Qk00000OABqpIAH","00442445","Support Ticket","Email Alert for License Renewal After Importing","We imported our new licenses yesterday, on 4/17/2025, but we received another email alert this morning with the subject ""Action Required: Subscription License Renewal Notice - Endpoint Protector"". Our previous license expiration date was 4/19/2025, and the correct date is now listed in the web interface, being 4/19/2028. 

Are there any additional steps we need to take to avoid any service interruptions? Also, why would we still be receiving the renewal notice after importing the new licenses?","","4/25/2025
