To respond to your inquiry related to the port, by default, Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) throttles instances on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) port 25 to prevent spam from being sent out. AWS blocks outbound traffic on port 25 for all EC2 instances and Lambda functions on elastic network interfaces.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Marian, 

I have received a query from customer. They are asking if Netwrix can enable port 25 for them, is it possible?

I have replied then that, ""I will confirm and netwrix might need a written consent from you to do this, due to possible security threats"". 

Kindly advise on this.

Thank you for getting back to us.

As we have mentioned before, port 25 is not blocked by Netwrix but by AWS directly.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) often restricts traffic over port 25 to prevent misuse and to ensure security compliance, therefore it is out of our reach in this case.

Let me know if you have further inquiries.

It is understood that port 25 can pose certain security concerns, and the consideration of those risks is appreciated. 

However, port 25 is primarily used for customer's SMTP traffic. Could Netwrix request AWS to allow port 25 for specifically for their use?

Thank you for your patience on this case. As of right now, our internal team have already made and sent over the request to the AWS team to whitelist the port 25 but since this specific port is closed and restricted on their end, it will take some time for the AWS team to open it accordingly.

Could you also let us know what is the IP address that you have for the Symantec Gateway? Is it the one mentioned in the previous emails:
210.3.132.50 

Or is it another one?

Looking forward to your response.

Can we ask you to please try to do the following steps:

1. Verify the SMTP Configuration, make sure the SMTP configuration is correct and functional.

I recommend deleting the current SMTP settings (simply clear the fields and save the configuration). Then, go back to System Configuration → System Settings, re-enter the SMTP details, and check the option ""Send email to my account."" (A printscreen with the configuration will be helpful)

This option triggers a test email. (Ask the customer to check if received the email)
- If the customer receives the test email, it means the SMTP configuration is working correctly. 
- If the customer does not receive the test email, the configuration is still incorrect. In that case, they will not receive any email alerts.
Currently, this is the reason why a ""Failed"" status appears in the Alert History page.

2. Please ask the customer also to check the message queues from Symantec Messaging Gateway to see if the email is not blocked there.

After completing the above steps, please let me know and I will collect the latest mail logs from our end.

Hi Support,

Thanks for the information and the reminder.
I have shared the information with them. They have also not responded any concerns of this anymore. Also, most of the questions were already discussed on a remote session with Netwrix support.
For now, customer is good. I think you can proceed to mark this ticket as CLOSED.

I will raise another ticket in future, if needed.

Thanks!

Hi Support, 

 

Thanks for the information and the reminder. 

I have shared the information with them. They have also not responded any concerns of this anymore. Also, most of the questions were already discussed on a remote session with Netwrix support. 

For now, customer is good. I think you can proceed to mark this ticket as CLOSED. 

 

I will raise another ticket in future, if needed. 

 

Thanks!

 


Best Regards,

Hi Milan,

I trust you are well.

I wanted to follow up on this case as I haven't received a response from you since my last email.  Did you have an opportunity to discuss / test with the customer yet?


Kind regards

Hello Milan

Can we ask you to please try to do the following steps:

1. Verify the SMTP Configuration, make sure the SMTP configuration is correct and functional.

I recommend deleting the current SMTP settings (simply clear the fields and save the configuration). Then, go back to System Configuration → System Settings, re-enter the SMTP details, and check the option ""Send email to my account."" (A printscreen with the configuration will be helpful)

This option triggers a test email. (Ask the customer to check if received the email)
- If the customer receives the test email, it means the SMTP configuration is working correctly. 
- If the customer does not receive the test email, the configuration is still incorrect. In that case, they will not receive any email alerts.
Currently, this is the reason why a ""Failed"" status appears in the Alert History page.

2. Please ask the customer also to check the message queues from Symantec Messaging Gateway to see if the email is not blocked there.

After completing the above steps, please let me know and I will collect the latest mail logs from our end.



Kind regards
