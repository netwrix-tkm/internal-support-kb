Our customer told us that EPP server is not sending alerts via SMTP anymore.

Kind Regards,
Baris","","In our session we covered the following:
We cleared the alerts cache and then did a rebuilt of the alerts cache via the Endpoint Protector Server's backend.
We checked the configurations of the Alerts, and then selected the customer's administrator profile in the alerts.
The customer set their custom no reply email in the SMTP configuration and sent a test email, the test email was received.
We then set a Deny right for the USB storage device type on the customer's endpoint computer.
We tested the scenario of Alerts by connecting a USB storage device to the customer's endpoint computer
We observed that the Alerts started to work as expected and the alerts were received into the customer's email Inbox
The issue was resolved in today's remote session.","Case can be closed","The issue was resolved in remote session.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts - Other","NONE","","79.3","Closed - Resolved","Amerikan Hastanesi","Erdem Baris Yabansu","2024-12-03T08:53:07.000Z","2025-02-20T16:39:11.000Z"
