Details:

Customer is aware of where to check all the records.

He would like to know how long it takes EPP to send an email once a user triggers an alert.

He observed inconsistencies:

Some email alerts report 1 activity detected.

Some email alerts report up to 10 activities at once.

Request:

Please confirm:

What is the expected delay (if any) between the alert trigger and email notification?

Customer is requesting clarification on the above points. Please advise.","","15.04
- customer is asking about the delay/timer for email alerts
- told them how they are sent (bulk or timed, depending on which criteria gets fulfilled first)

16.04
- scheduled a RS on the 17th as per the customer's request

17.04
During the RS we did the following
- explained the customer how the alerts are being sent - time wise
- went over alerts and tested  File Copy alerts during the call
- answered their other questions regarding alert times
- told the customer they can change client-server communication time, but not too low, because that will cause resource usage. I recommended to set it to 60 seconds
- the customer had more scenarios for alerts that should be sent and we went over them","16.04
- waiting on RS to take place to test email alerts

17.04
- waiting on further questions or ticket closure","after providing the answers to the customers quiestions during the remote sesssion, they confirmed the ticket can be closed","Advanced Configuration Change","Botond Biro","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts - Other","","","7.9","Closed - Resolved","Averis Sdn Bhd.","Sharnitha Seethaiah","2025-04-14T07:19:45.000Z","2025-04-22T06:01:51.000Z"
