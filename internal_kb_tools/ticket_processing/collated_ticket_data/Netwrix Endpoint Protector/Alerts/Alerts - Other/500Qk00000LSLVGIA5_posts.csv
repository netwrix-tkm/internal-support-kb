I am reaching to see what are the options we have for alerting when an admin make changes on the server - 
1. Can we configure an alert when a change is done in EPP to create alert ? 

2. Can we  create a custom admin role to only be able to apply changes to existing rules, but not add new features.

3. is it possible to have 2 admins to approve a Global change to get published. 

4. Additionally I would to know if we can use the same license to setup a test environment ? (replica of the production)

Reg,
