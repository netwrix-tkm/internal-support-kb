I hope this message finds you well.

I am experiencing troubles sending email alerts from endpoint protector. I am using Google Mail as my email host. I've applied the recommended email settings, including creating SMTP relay, but I am not receiving any test emails from Endpoint Protector.


Kind Regards,
