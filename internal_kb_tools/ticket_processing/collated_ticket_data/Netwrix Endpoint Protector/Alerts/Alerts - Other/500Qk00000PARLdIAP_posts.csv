This has been a constant issue.  We swtiched to cloud hosted earlier this year and it worked then.   I just checked the alert history, there are none. See screenshot.  I went to the mail set up and sent a test email.  that worked fine.  And then we started getting random email alerts of the kind we should have been getting all along. The alerts are from April.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-14T18:57:01.000Z"
