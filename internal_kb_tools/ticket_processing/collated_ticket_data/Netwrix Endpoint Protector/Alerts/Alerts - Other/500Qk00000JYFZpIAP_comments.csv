Hi Flaviu,

As a workaround, please advise the customer to delete the alert and recreate it.

 A new ticket has been created and forwarded to the product team for prioritization.

The customer has re-created the alerts, but the issue still persists. 

Please advise.

Note: Another customer has mentioned that in the past they deleted and re-created the alert but the issue persisted for them too, so this may not be a an isolated case where this procedure doesn't work.

Thank you!

Hi,

In this case, the setup alert is not a Device Control alert as mentioned in the print screens.

This is about the Transfer Limit Alert from the Global Setting Page, which is sent to all the super administrators.
The only workaround here is to delete the administrator from the database or to disable the alerts from the Global Setting page (or any other entity page like Group/User /Computer ) by switching the ""Transfer Limit Reached Alert"" setting to OFF.


	 - 	select id from sf_guard_user where username = 'jspidcock@pidcockcompany.com';
	 - 	delete from sf_guard_user_profile where user_id = prev_user_id;
	 - 	delete from sf_guard_user where id = ...;

If an error is displayed, it indicates that the administrator has multiple database relationships.
Observe the error, identify the associated table, and attempt to delete the corresponding record from that table.


Additionally, a new ticket will be created and forwarded to the product team for prioritization.
