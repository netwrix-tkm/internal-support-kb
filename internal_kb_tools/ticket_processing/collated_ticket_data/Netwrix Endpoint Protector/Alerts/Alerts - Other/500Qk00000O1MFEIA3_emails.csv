Thank you for your patience!

I found out the following information about alerts.
Alerts are being triggered either when a specific threshold is reached or at predefined intervals.
They are sent in bulk once a threshold (100 logs) is reached, or, alternatively, alerts are sent on a timed basis—every 2 hours—regardless of volume, after they were processed on the server.

Hi Support,
Good day to you!

Thank you for the information provided.

I have shared the details with the customer, and they have a few concerns and questions as outlined below:

  *   Is it possible to configure the 100 logs threshold or the 2-hour threshold? If so, could you kindly share the steps or documentation on how this can be configured?
  *   Is there any reference document or URL available for further details?

The customer has expressed a need to receive email alerts more promptly. Their concern is that if the 100-log threshold is not met, they may not receive any alerts, or may only receive them after two hours-delaying their ability to take immediate action.

We would appreciate your assistance in addressing these queries and concerns.

Also, please let us know if we can have meeting with customer, if so kindly let us know your availability for 16th or 17th April Malaysia Time (after 11:30 AM). Please share 2-3 time slots.

Thank you for your continued support.

I apologise, we made a small mistake previously and sent you the wrong information.

The job that gathers and sends the logs via email, runs every 2 minutes, not hours. It checks for all unsent alerts and sends them, either when there are 100 events, or every two minutes, even if there are only 4 events for example.

We can't configure this job, because the limits were imposed to not overload the server.

Does the customer still want to have a remote session? I am available on the 17th, from 3 or 4pm Malaysia time.

Hi Milan,

I apologise, we made a small mistake previously and sent you the wrong information.

The job that gathers and sends the logs via email, runs every 2 minutes, not hours. It checks for all unsent alerts and sends them, either when there are 100 events, or every two minutes, even if there are only 4 events for example.

We can't configure this job, because the limits were imposed to not overload the server.

Does the customer still want to have a remote session? I am available on the 17th, from 3 or 4pm Malaysia time.

Hi Support, 

Good day to you!


Thank you for the information provided.

I have shared the details with the customer, and they have a few concerns and questions as outlined below:


	Is it possible to configure the 100 logs threshold or the 2-hour threshold? If so, could you kindly share the steps or documentation on how this can be configured?
	Is there any reference document or URL available for further details?


The customer has expressed a need to receive email alerts more promptly. Their concern is that if the 100-log threshold is not met, they may not receive any alerts, or may only receive them after two hours—delaying their ability to take immediate action.

We would appreciate your assistance in addressing these queries and concerns.

Also, please let us know if we can have meeting with customer, if so kindly let us know your availability for 16th or 17th April Malaysia Time (after 11:30 AM). Please share 2-3 time slots. 

Thank you for your continued support.

Hi Sharnitha,

Thank you for your patience!

I found out the following information about alerts.
Alerts are being triggered either when a specific threshold is reached or at predefined intervals.
They are sent in bulk once a threshold (100 logs) is reached, or, alternatively, alerts are sent on a timed basis—every 2 hours—regardless of volume, after they were processed on the server.
