Details:

Customer is aware of where to check all the records.

He would like to know how long it takes EPP to send an email once a user triggers an alert.

He observed inconsistencies:

Some email alerts report 1 activity detected.

Some email alerts report up to 10 activities at once.

Request:

Please confirm:

What is the expected delay (if any) between the alert trigger and email notification?

Customer is requesting clarification on the above points. Please advise.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-14T07:19:45.000Z"

During the RS we did the following
- explained the customer how the alerts are being sent - time wise
- went over alerts and tested  File Copy alerts during the call
- answered their other questions regarding alert times
- told the customer they can change client-server communication time, but not too low, because that will cause resource usage. I recommended to set it to 60 seconds
- the customer had more scenarios for alerts that should be sent and we went over them","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-04-17T09:50:28.000Z"
