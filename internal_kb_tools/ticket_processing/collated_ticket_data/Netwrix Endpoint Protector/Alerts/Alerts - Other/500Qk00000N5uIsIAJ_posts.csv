Partner shared our feedback and steps with the customer. Customer has not responded with any concerns of this anymore. Also, most of the questions were already discussed on a remote session with Netwrix support.

For now, customer is good. We can proceed to close this ticket.  Partner will raise another ticket in future, if needed.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-24T06:57:07.000Z"
