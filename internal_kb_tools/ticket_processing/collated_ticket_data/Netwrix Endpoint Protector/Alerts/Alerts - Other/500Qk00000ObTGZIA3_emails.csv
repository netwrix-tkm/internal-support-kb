Thank you for reaching out.

In order to prevent the EPP Client to show any notifications you can switch the client mode to ""Silent"".
This mode is similar to Normal mode the one which should be active now, except that pop-up notiﬁcations are not visible to the user
Selecting this mode will:


	
	Display the system tray icon
	
	
	Not display system tray notiﬁcations
	
	
	Apply all set rights and settings as per their conﬁguration
	

The client mode can be modified at Global, Group, Computer or User level.
In order to change the client mode you should access Device Control -> Global Settings -> Search for Client Mode -> Select the desired mode.
Also, it can be set at group level -> Device Control -> Groups -> Click on the Actions button on the right side of the desired group -> Manage Settings -> Set the client mode.

More details regarding the Client Mode can be found here:

Also, regarding the Content Aware Protection reports that the users can see, you can Disable the Client Notifications and the EPP Client will not show any reports generated by the policy.
In order to disable the Client Notifications for a Content Aware Policy you should access Content Aware Protection -> Content Aware Policies -> Edit the policy where you want to disable the notifications -> search for ""Client notifications"" and then switch them off.

Please note that each policy has it's own notifications and you will have to disable the notifications manually for all the Content Aware Policies where you don't need the notifications to be shown.

Let me know if this helps and if there is something else that I can help you with.

Thank you,
Emil
