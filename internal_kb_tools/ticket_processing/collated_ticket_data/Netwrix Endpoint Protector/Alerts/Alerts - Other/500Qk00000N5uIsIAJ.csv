Hope this email finds you well. 

Averis wants to integrate their SMTP server with EPP, in order to receive email Alerts. 
We have tried multiple things, although, we are not able to achieve the goal. 
I request a remote session with you and customer. 
Please confirm your availability for the below time slots, along with your email id, for invite of the meeting. 

1.20 March 2025 (Thursday), 2pm-3pm MYT
2.20 March 2025 (Thursday), 4pm-5pm MYT

Do let me know, which one works best for you and we will send you invite. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","Sent an e-mail to product security asking to allow the port 25 on our side.
They replied back confirming we can create an ADO to the DevOps.

2025.04.11 - Partner provided an update stating that the customer is now able to receive email alerts.
however there are few email alerts that fail and have requested our assistance in investigating and finding the reason why some alerts fail.","Will need to create an ADO.

2025.04.11 - update was relayed to R&D team, waiting on their response on next steps to take.

2025.04.16:
R&D team provided some steps for the customer to follow by clearing the SMTP configuration and setting it up again. I have relayed this feedback to the partner and will update the ticket after receiving their response.

2025.04.24:
Partner shared our feedback and steps with the customer. Customer has not responded with any concerns of this anymore. Also, most of the questions were already discussed on a remote session with Netwrix support.

For now, customer is good. We can proceed to close this ticket.  Partner will raise another ticket in future, if needed.","2025.04.24:
