@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Marian, the request has been sent over to AWS, it will take some time for the ports to be opened as this is a special request (normally the 25 port is closed and access is restricted). In the meantime could you also reach out to the customer in order for them to provide the IP address that we need to also ad in the Security Group for the Server? The IP The IP Address of the Symantec Messaging Gateway.

Thank you

Hi Marian,

We have received the confirmation from AWS that the port is now open. We have added the NACL rules for outbound and inbound communication. Could you please verify from the instance if you can telnet to the customer ip from port 25. And if that is successful then you can let the customer know that the port is open and they can configure the mailing part.

Thank you,
Bogdan

Hi Andre,


Please try to do the following steps:



	 - 	Verify the SMTP Configuration

Make sure the SMTP configuration is correct and functional.

I recommend deleting the current SMTP settings (simply clear the fields and save the configuration). Then, go back to System Configuration → System Settings, re-enter the SMTP details, and check the option ""Send email to my account."" (A printscreen with the configuration will be helpful)

This option triggers a test email. (Ask the customer to check if received the email)

	 - 	If the customer receives the test email, it means the SMTP configuration is working correctly. 
	 - 	If the customer does not receive the test email, the configuration is still incorrect. In that case, they will not receive any email alerts.

Currently, this is the reason why a ""Failed"" status appears in the Alert History page.


        2. Collect the logs

Please provide the latest logs from /var/log/mailer.log file.

Please ask the customer also to check the message queues from Symantec Messaging Gateway to see if the email is not blocked there.


Regards,
Augustina
