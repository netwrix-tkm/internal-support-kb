Hi Veronica,

We can take a look together. Normally you should receive the alerts even after going over 90%.

Please let me know if you have availability next week for a remote session.

I do see that I am no longer getting the licenses warning alert.   We are well over the 90%. 

 

 

Is that still broken?

Hi Veronica,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we took a look over the alerts that you did not receive in your inbox and we at first recreated the ""Artifact Received"" Alert. After that we tried to trigger it and it worked. We then re-created the rest of the Alerts and we asked if you could please try to trigger them on your end to see if they work now.

We will wait to hear back from you on this.

Hi Veronica,

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session this week(Tuesday-Friday) so we can fix the boot space / security upgrade issue. Please let us know some time intervals when you have availability.

In the meantime we have already asked our devs for assistance for the alerts issue. Once we receive an update from them we will get back to you and we will schedule a remote session.

I do see that I am no longer getting the licenses warning alert.   We are well over the 90%.


Is that still broken?

Hi Veronica,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we took a look over the alerts that you did not receive in your inbox and we at first recreated the ""Artifact Received"" Alert. After that we tried to trigger it and it worked. We then re-created the rest of the Alerts and we asked if you could please try to trigger them on your end to see if they work now.

We will wait to hear back from you on this.

Hi Veronica,

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session this Friday so we can fix the boot space / security upgrade issue. Please let us know some time intervals when you have availability.

In the meantime we have already asked our devs for assistance for the alerts issue. Once we receive an update from them we will get back to you and we will schedule a remote session.

I have spoken with my colleagues from the dev team and they asked us to raise a separate ticket for the System License Alert issue. We have raised the below ticket and I will keep you posted after I receive updates on it and starting with the 19-20th of December, as requested.

00428173 - System alerts for licenses not triggering when reaching 70% or higher(previously it was 90%).

We are closing this ticket as after we recreated the rest of the alerts it seems to have resolved the issue.

Please let me know if you have availability next week for a remote session.

I do see that I am no longer getting the licenses warning alert.   We are well over the 90%. 

 

 

Is that still broken?

Hi Veronica,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we took a look over the alerts that you did not receive in your inbox and we at first recreated the ""Artifact Received"" Alert. After that we tried to trigger it and it worked. We then re-created the rest of the Alerts and we asked if you could please try to trigger them on your end to see if they work now.

We will wait to hear back from you on this.
