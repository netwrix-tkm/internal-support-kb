"500Qk00000FeJPtIAN","00420752","Support Ticket","Setting an alert when a file hash on a file that is located on an internal hard drive is changed","Good Afternoon,


I just wanted to reach out today to see if you, or someone in your organization, could advise if there is a method within the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Appliance running version 5.9.4.0 for setting up an alert when a file hash on a file that is located on an internal hard drive is changed. At current we see many different alerts we can create, but don’t appear to see an option for a file hash modification. Additionally, with the File Hashes option enabled on the appliance, the only files we are seeing hashes generated for are those associated with a removable storage device, is it possible to have hashes generated for files located on Network Shares and internal storage?


Thank you,","","There is no available method to receive an alert when a file's hash is modified.

We tried to enable file Hash from the Global Settings, but this did not return anything on the customer side when logs were generated.","21Jan: Communicated to customer: there is no available method to receive an alert when a file's hash is modified. Asked if there is any other info we can provide.
