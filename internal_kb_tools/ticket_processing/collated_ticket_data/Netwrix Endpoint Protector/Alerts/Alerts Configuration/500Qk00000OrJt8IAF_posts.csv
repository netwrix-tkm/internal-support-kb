I'm requesting your support regarding the following situation.

I've been using ENDPOINT PROTECTOR for some time without any issues, but about 20 days ago, I stopped receiving email alerts. I checked the settings in System Configuration > System Settings > Email System Settings, and everything is the same as before. I performed the available software update to version 5.9.4.1 to see if the problem was resolved. The update was successful, but it did not resolve the issue.
Could you help me correct the problem so I can continue receiving email alerts?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-06T18:53:56.000Z"
