Customer did not use the App password, an APP password is mandatory for the SMTP service to authenticate via Endpoint Protector. 
We have set the hostname to: ""smtp-mail.outlook.com""

Customer confirmed that the SMTP issue is resolved.   I will close this case.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-06T16:54:10.000Z"
