I would like to know if it is possible to configure the DLP alerts to be received via email, since I have tried but I do not see the alert. If possible I would like to schedule a session for Thursday, January 30 at 9 am Colombia time (Bogota time zone (GMT-5)).

I remain attentive to comments.
Thank you","","","","Closing ticket per last comment.","","Zachary Roy","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts Configuration","","","63.2","Closed - Resolved","JAIME TORRES","Juan Cortes","2025-01-29T14:31:24.000Z","2025-04-02T19:27:41.000Z"
