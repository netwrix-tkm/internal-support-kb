Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Please let us know your availability and suggest three time slots between Tuesday - Friday for a remote session.

For the issues with mac policies, could you please open a separate case for this as we need to track the cases separately.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.



Kind regards

Hi Karthik,

Please let us know your availability and suggest three time slots between Tuesday - Friday for a remote session.

For the issues with mac policies, could you please open a separate case for this as we need to track the cases separately.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Please let us know your availability and suggest three time slots between Tuesday - Friday for a remote session.

For the issues with mac policies, could you please open a separate case for this as we need to track the cases separately.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?


Kind regards

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.

Hi Vamshi,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As we discovered on our call earlier that EPP are reporting file transfers via webmail but even through the file shadows feature is enabled for Content Aware Protection there were no file shadows present under the Content Aware Report > event logs.  For this we captured the epp client log files (debug logging), please do send to us the artifact uploaded to the EPP Server today.  Our Dev team will need these logs in order to investigate the root cause.

We also discovered that you were not able to enable ""Report v2"" under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"" as it is greyed out.  I am consulting with the team internally today and will get back to you with feedback soon.



Kind regards

Hi Karthik,

Please let us know your availability and suggest three time slots between Tuesday - Friday for a remote session.

For the issues with mac policies, could you please open a separate case for this as we need to track the cases separately.

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for confirming.  The configuration settings for a Google email account are as shown below in the screenshot.  Please note that you will need to create an App password for the Google email account being used.  You can create one here by following this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords





Unfortunately I don't have available slots today for a remote session, could you let us know your availability for tomorrow or during the week if you are unsuccessful with setting up the SMTP service with the above configurations?


Kind regards

Hi Karthik,

Could you give us a little more detail on the email account which you want to configure on EPP please?
Is the email server Microsoft 365, Google or your own native e-mail server?
The configuration settings will differ depending on the e-mail service provider being used.

Kind regards
