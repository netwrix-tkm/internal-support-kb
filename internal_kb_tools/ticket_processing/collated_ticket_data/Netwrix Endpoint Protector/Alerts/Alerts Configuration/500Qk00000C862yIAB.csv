"500Qk00000C862yIAB","00412620","Support Ticket","E-mail Server Settings","Hi,
I'm trying to configure email server settings (see ""<a href='https://EmailServerSettings.png' target='_blank'>EmailServerSettings.png</a>"") to receive alert notifications. I sent test mail to my account but but I donâ€™t get the mail. 
Through ""Libraesva email security"" I see that the email has the status of ""Invalid Sender"" (see ""<a href='https://InvalidSender.png' target='_blank'>InvalidSender.png</a>""), what should I do? Do I need to change the configuration?

Thanks in advance!
