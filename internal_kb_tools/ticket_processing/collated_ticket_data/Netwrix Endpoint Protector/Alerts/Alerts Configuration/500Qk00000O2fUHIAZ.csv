"500Qk00000O2fUHIAZ","00441982","Support Ticket","SMTP Configuration Needs to Be Updated","The initial POC testing configuration form March 2024 does not appear to be working. We are not receiving any of the alert we should. Please advise!","","Asked the customer to add an email address to the used epp admin and retest.

The customer changed the SMTP configuration to use a different provider, but it is not working. They asked us to check it from the server's backend.

We checked the connection between EPP and Mimecast SMTP servers, and it's OK. We recommended that the customer set a custom email sender address and check if TLS 1.3 is also used by their SMTP server.

The customer is investigating internally the Mimecast logs for denying the epp connection, and they asked for more details about the password limitation in epp(complexity and allowed special characters), which we asked the engineering team about.

13 May '25 - Waiting for Engineering to provide the answer to this. It was sent on May 8th

We had a remote session with the customer and the Mimecast team, and after resetting the SMTP account password to a shorter one, the issue was resolved. The customer tested and confirmed that the 25-character limit is indeed enforced. We are still not certain if this limitation is on our side or specific to Mimecast.","Waiting for the customer's feedback.

Waiting to get AWS backend access.(this has been requested on EPP-hosted-environment-access teams chat)
