This morning, we’re still encountering email alerts/report(attached)  for Transfer Limit events being sent to addresses other than the system administrator we had configured  previously.
Additionally, is it possible to disable Transfer Limits report  other than the options daily, weekly, and monthly as available in Device control -> Settings ?

As we agreed you will monitor the situation after you will whitelist the email address and let us know if the issue persist .

Looking forward for your response.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel, after whitelisting the email from the EPP server, we found that the alert email is not sent to the recipient address that we previously removed from the EPP server. However, the email is still sent to all administrators who are still listed as System Administrators.

We would like to confirm whether there is a way for only one super administrator to receive the transfer limit report/alert (in this case it.security@prodia.co.id)?
Or can the transfer limit report to email be disabled while the EPP server still logs the transfer limit in the report & analysis?

Thank you,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

I have checked internally and the Transfer limit alert once is enabled it will send to all super admins setup in your console. 

If you disable the Transfer limit alert from the Global settings, but you complete all the other fields, the alert will be sent as you specify in the Transfer Limit Reached Report (daily, weekly, monthly). 

If we disable the alert completely it will not be generated in the Reports either.

The recommendation is to set the Transfer Limit Reached Report to weekly and remove the super administrator option for the users that should not receive the alert.

Please check and let us know what you decide.

Have a nice day! 

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

The transfer limit report to the email is functioning as expected, sending the weekly report only to the root account email.
However, the customer has still inquired if it is possible to completely disable the email report function for the transfer limit, while still keeping the transfer limit feature enabled. In this case, the customer would still be able to view the transfer limit reached events through Log Reports. This request stems from the fact that a large number of emails are being sent to the mailbox at once for the transfer limit report.
Thank you.

Thank you for getting back to us.

I'm glad to hear that the alerts are in place now. 

Regarding the customer question, as I mentioned in my previous replies if you disable the Transfer limit alert from the Global settings, but you complete all the other fields, the alert will be sent as you specify in the Transfer Limit Reached Report (daily, weekly, monthly). 

If we disable the alert completely it will not be generated in the Reports either.

Presuming that the customer, would like to have this feature, then I would recommend you to open a new case that we can use as a Feature Request and send it to our Management team for further analysis.

Have a nice day ahead!
