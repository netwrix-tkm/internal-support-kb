Hi Botond,

Yes it looks like all Administrators are getting them.
I didn’t see it before as most of the Admin accounts don’t have a mailbox itself.
Whats a bit weird is that the Daily report is send multiple times day ?

If I would disable this in the global settings would I still be able to setup alerts for the Transfer Limit ?

Best regards
Benjamin

Hi Benjamin,

It should be sent out to all EPP administrators.
Does the alert get sent to all of them?

Hi Benjamin,

You can find the alerts that were set up in Alerts -> Device Control Alerts, and there you can edit them and check who was set up to receive the alert in the Administrators box.
It should look something like this:

Hi Botond,

 

I thought so too but there are no alerts setup yet.

But still one of our admins does get the daily report.

 

Best regards
Benjamin

Hi Benjamin,

You can find the alerts that were set up in Alerts -> Device Control Alerts, and there you can edit them and check who was set up to receive the alert in the Administrators box.
It should look something like this:


On the bottom of the page you can see who was selected to be monitored:

Hi Botond,

 

Thank you. I’ve found the setting. Can you explain where the recipient of the Transfer Limit Report is set ?

 

Best regards

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for reaching out!
The transfer limit settings can be configured in Device Control -> Global Settings, or for each computer/user individually:


You can check which files were transferred in Reports and Analysis -> File tracing, where you can filter them to only show you the relevant entries:

Hi Benjamin,

You can still create an alert for transfer limit even if you disable it in the Global Settings.

Hi Botond,

Yes it looks like all Administrators are getting them.
I didn’t see it before as most of the Admin accounts don’t have a mailbox itself.
Whats a bit weird is that the Daily report is send multiple times day ?

If I would disable this in the global settings would I still be able to setup alerts for the Transfer Limit ?

Best regards
Benjamin

Hi Benjamin,

It should be sent out to all EPP administrators.
Does the alert get sent to all of them?

Hi Benjamin,

That feature has its own alert which is not configured from the alert menu, that is why it has the report option within the setting itself.

Hi Botond,

I am sure that in this case the reports will stop coming but eventually we will use this feature in the near future and I think we should find out why they are send without a configured alert.

Could you please check in Device Control - Global or Computer settings, depending on how you set up the users' configurations, if Transfer Limit Reached Alert is turned on or off?
