Hello Karthik,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have created a test policy to monitor the file transfers, for which we have created a CAP alert. 

We have made multiple tests, but none of the successful. Please check if the email settings are setup correctly and try to send a test email. 
In this way we can verify if the alerts are being received or not. 

I have also scheduled a new session for tomorrow at 12:30 IST and sent you the meeting details in a separate email.

Have a nice day ahead!
