Hi,

Have you checked if the alerts are configured properly? (in the future, some printscreens will be helpful )
> check the event of the alert (it is the same as the policy event)
> check the entities (machines/users) that are checked in the alert; Are they also checked in the policy?

If alerts are configured ok, please try to follow the next steps to regenerate the alerts cache:

	 - 	Login into MySQL and run the following commands:

	 - 	DELETE table old_alert;
	 - 	DELETE table old_cf_alert;
	 - 	Exit from MySQL;
	 - 	Rebuild the alerts cache:

	 - 	php /opt/eppworker/build_alerts_cache.php
	 - 	Check if the alerts cache was created:

	 - 	ls -la /run/shm/mcache/
	 - 	Seach after cf_alerts and/or dc_alerts directories

  
​Try to generate a new event and check the alert_flag.




FYI @WaitingOnEngineer
