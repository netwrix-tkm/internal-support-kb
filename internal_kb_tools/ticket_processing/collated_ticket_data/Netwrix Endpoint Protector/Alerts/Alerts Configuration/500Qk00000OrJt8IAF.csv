I'm requesting your support regarding the following situation.

I've been using ENDPOINT PROTECTOR for some time without any issues, but about 20 days ago, I stopped receiving email alerts. I checked the settings in System Configuration > System Settings > Email System Settings, and everything is the same as before. I performed the available software update to version 5.9.4.1 to see if the problem was resolved. The update was successful, but it did not resolve the issue.
Could you help me correct the problem so I can continue receiving email alerts?","","","","The issue was that there were a lot of alerts that were pending to be processed and this caused them to be stuck. We cleared the alerts and recreated the alert cache. It should now work.

We strongly recommend reducing the number of alerts that you are generating as this may cause future blockages.","High Load/Scalability Limitation","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts Configuration","","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Caaliope","Ernesto Ortega","2025-05-06T18:53:54.000Z","2025-05-13T18:58:52.000Z"
