We received an escalation from the customer regarding an issue with email alerts being sent to an Active Directory administrator's email address that has already been deleted from the EPP server.

They have also disabled the SMTP server configuration but are still receiving email notifications from the EPP server.

Can we have a remote session to check pending emails from the EPP server to the SMTP server?

Thank you, 

Regards,
