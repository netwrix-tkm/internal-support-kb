Hi Andrei,

We found the reason why we cannot access the Endpoint Protector server.
Our Endpoint Protector server is receiving a lot of logs from clients. Hence CPU usage of our server is very high and cannot maintain the session from remote.
That’s why we cannot try the solution that you told me.

Could you please me how can I reduce the number of logs that Endpoint Protector server receives?

Best Regards,
Juinchi
