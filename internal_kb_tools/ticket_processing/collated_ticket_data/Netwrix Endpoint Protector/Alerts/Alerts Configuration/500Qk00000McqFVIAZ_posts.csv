Seems like they are having issues adjusting the SMTP settings within System Settings->Email Server Settings as they might not have the proper configuration done on the Exchange Side as Adrian mentioned during the meeting.
He sent them an e-mail with instructions on how to configure the settings there and try again after that and let us know how it goes.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-13T14:41:14.000Z"

Connected to the backend and did a ping to the mimecast and office65 host.
Eventually Tumelo took a look at the exchange site and did some tests and he came up with a way to create the connectivity through a relay.
Will follow up with him to let us know if he needs further assistance.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-25T14:35:58.000Z"
