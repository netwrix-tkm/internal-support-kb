Hi Marian

The IP address has not been blocked on our firewalls, but we are not seeing any traffic to or from it. The primary objective of this session is to test connectivity to the Mimecast smart host. However, I am unable to proceed as I do not have SSH access to the machine.

Could you assist by initiating an SSH session and verifying the connectivity?

Hello Tumelo,

We've joined the remote session at 2 PM SA time but couldn't get ahold of you.

As we have mentioned in the previous replies, the IP 111.33.33.111<http://111.33.33.111> does not have an impact on the SMTP configuration and also please do not attempt to block it as it may affect the functionality of the EPP(the IP is used for internal routing).

Looking forward to your response.

Good day Marian

I have an issue determining if the server is trying to reach the O365/Mimecast host. So far we cannot see any interaction with the smtp hosts.
Will you be able to use putty to test connectivity to the smtp hosts?

I have an issue determining if the server is trying to reach the O365/Mimecast host. So far we cannot see any interaction with the smtp hosts.
Will you be able to use putty to test connectivity to the smtp hosts?
