Flaviu is on leave until Monday and until then I will try to assist you, unless you prefer waiting for Flaviu to return on Monday.
There is no reason for our server to block any SMTP servers unless you are using a relay instead of an SMTP server and are hosted by us, in which case port 25 is not open due to security reasons.
Can you share a screenshot of the SMTP settings?

Hi Vatsal,

Flaviu is on leave until Monday and until then I will try to assist you, unless you prefer waiting for Flaviu to return on Monday.
There is no reason for our server to block any SMTP servers unless you are using a relay instead of an SMTP server and are hosted by us, in which case port 25 is not open due to security reasons.
Can you share a screenshot of the SMTP settings?

Thank you,

Hello,
We are not going to be able to use gmail or O365. Is there a way for it to work with Postmark?

 

Best Regards
