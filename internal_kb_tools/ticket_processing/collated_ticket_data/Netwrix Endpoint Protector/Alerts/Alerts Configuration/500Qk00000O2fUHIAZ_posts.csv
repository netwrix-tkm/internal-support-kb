We had a remote session with the customer and the Mimecast team, and after resetting the SMTP account password to a shorter one, the issue was resolved. The customer tested and confirmed that the 25-character limit is indeed enforced. We are still not certain if this limitation is on our side or specific to Mimecast.","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2025-05-15T16:23:44.000Z"
