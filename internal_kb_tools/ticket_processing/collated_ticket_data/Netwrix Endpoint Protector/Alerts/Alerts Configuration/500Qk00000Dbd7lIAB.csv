"500Qk00000Dbd7lIAB","00416269","Support Ticket","Email is not sent to the admin","Hi team,

We are in a POC with this prospect: Airpak. We have added the email server details in System configuration. We have also followed these steps in Gmail:
a. Go to Gmail - Manage your Google Account - Security - Apps Password 
b. Use your Gmail password to get access to this section 
c. Go to Select App - Other (Custom Name) - type ""EPP"" and click Generate 
d. A one-time password will be generated and the password will be used in the EPP server (write it down) 
e. Go in the Endpoint Protector Server at System Configuration - System Settings - E-mail Server Settings and enter the right information 

However, the admin is not getting the test email. What could be the reason?

We have scheduled a POC next steps meeting on Monday, 29 of July at 6pm Romania time. Could an engineer join to help with these settings?

Since the prospect does not speak Spanish it is important to be in the meeting for translation purposes. This is the reason I am inviting some of you to the meeting.

There is another issue. Besides this, once one of the computer was restarted the EPP agent disappeared and the mode was normal. Could you please help with this as well during the same meeting?

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","we set up alerting and gmail smtp","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts Configuration","","","3.0","Closed - Resolved","Airpak","Stefania Oltean","2024-07-26T16:49:28.000Z","2024-07-29T15:58:59.000Z"
