I need to know if we need to whitelist this IP to allow SMTP settings access to send mail to mimecast","","Connected remote along with Adrian to take a look and assist Tumelo.
Connected to the backend and did a ping to the mimecast and office65 host.
Eventually Tumelo took a look at the exchange site and did some tests and he came up with a way to create the connectivity through a relay.
Will follow up with him to let us know if he needs further assistance.","Will wait for their response.","Closing ticket as resolved.","","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Alerts","Alerts Configuration","NONE","","19.0","Closed - Resolved","JSE Investor Services (Pty) Limited","Tumelo Molefe","2025-03-06T14:14:51.000Z","2025-03-25T14:53:13.000Z"
