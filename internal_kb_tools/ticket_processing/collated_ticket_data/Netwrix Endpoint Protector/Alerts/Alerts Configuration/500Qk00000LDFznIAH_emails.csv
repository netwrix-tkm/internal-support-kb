Good morning

I would like to know if it is possible to configure the file transfer alerts with specific words in the DLP to receive them by email. If possible I would like to schedule a session for Wednesday March 02nd at 9 am Colombia time (Bogotá time zone (GMT-5)).

I remain attentive to your comments
