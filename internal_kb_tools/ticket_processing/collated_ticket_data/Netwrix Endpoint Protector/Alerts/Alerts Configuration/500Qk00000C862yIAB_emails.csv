Hi André,
thanks for the availability but I managed to fix the configuration and now the emails are sent, so the call is no longer necessary.
I just want to ask you for advice on notifications. I have set a Content Aware Protection Policy (policy action ""Block & Report"") and I would like to receive notifications.
In System Parameters > Device Types and Notifications, is it correct to create a new template in the section ""Custom Content Aware Protection Notifications"" and then in the policy in the "" Notification Template "" section select the new template created?
If yes, I configured the template as in the image. Do you have better examples of how I could configure the message?

Thank you for letting me know that the email alert issue is solved.  Regarding your question on notifications, the portion which you are referencing is for custom notifications that are shown on the user / endpoint side.  If you wish to set custom notifications then yes, you may use this method as shown in the screenshot that you sent.  Alternatively you can use the default notification.  For notification pop-ups to show on the user's side you would need to make sure that ""Notifications Pop-up"" is enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings""

Do you want to set your own custom notifications or did you want to enable the default notifications?  could you please confirm what type of notifications you require?

Hi André,
no sorry I was wrong. I thought that in that section you could change the message that comes to administrators when a policy is applied. Instead of what you told me, I changed the template for notifications to users. My purpose was instead to edit the message that arrives to the administrator (see image below) after enabling the Content Aware Alerts of the event ""Content Threat Blocked"":
[Immagine che contiene testo, schermata, Carattere, documento  Descrizione generata automaticamente]

I noticed that there are no attached files and the message does not provide specific information.

Two questions:
1- Can I edit this message by entering additional information?
2- Why is the attached file not present?

Thanks in advance!

Thank you for clarifying.  Regarding the questions which you have, please see below answers.

1- Can I edit this message by entering additional information? Unfortunately the alert emails are standardized and cannot be customized.

2- Why is the attached file not present?  Can I ask which email client are you using (is it Outlook?) and if the alert emails are located in the Inbox folder?

Hi André,

no sorry I was wrong. I thought that in that section you could change the message that comes to administrators when a policy is applied. Instead of what you told me, I changed the template for notifications to users. My purpose was instead to edit the message that arrives to the administrator (see image below) after enabling the Content Aware Alerts of the event ""Content Threat Blocked"":



 

I noticed that there are no attached files and the message does not provide specific information.

 

Two questions:

1- Can I edit this message by entering additional information?

2- Why is the attached file not present?

 

Thanks in advance!

 

Giulia Cavalleretto

Hi Giulia,

Thank you for letting me know that the email alert issue is solved.  Regarding your question on notifications, the portion which you are referencing is for custom notifications that are shown on the user / endpoint side.  If you wish to set custom notifications then yes, you may use this method as shown in the screenshot that you sent.  Alternatively you can use the default notification.  For notification pop-ups to show on the user's side you would need to make sure that ""Notifications Pop-up"" is enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings""

Do you want to set your own custom notifications or did you want to enable the default notifications?  could you please confirm what type of notifications you require?


Kind regards

Hi André,

thanks for the availability but I managed to fix the configuration and now the emails are sent, so the call is no longer necessary.

I just want to ask you for advice on notifications. I have set a Content Aware Protection Policy (policy action ""Block & Report"") and I would like to receive notifications.

In System Parameters > Device Types and Notifications, is it correct to create a new template in the section “Custom Content Aware Protection Notifications” and then in the policy in the "" Notification Template "" section select the new template created?

If yes, I configured the template as in the image. Do you have better examples of how I could configure the message?

 



 

Thanks in advance!

Hi Giulia,

Thank you for the details, so the attachments are still not visible after you moved them to your Inbox folder?
If this is the case, can we have a remote session so that I can observe the behavior on a call please? I have slots open for Thursday and Friday.

Hi André,
ok thanks for the first question.

For the second question, yes it is Outlook. Initially the emails arrived in the junk box, now they have been moved to the inbox folder.

Thanks!

Hi Giulia,

Thank you for clarifying.  Regarding the questions which you have, please see below answers.

1- Can I edit this message by entering additional information? Unfortunately the alert emails are standardized and cannot be customized.

2- Why is the attached file not present?  Can I ask which email client are you using (is it Outlook?) and if the alert emails are located in the Inbox folder?



Kind regards

Hi André,
no sorry I was wrong. I thought that in that section you could change the message that comes to administrators when a policy is applied. Instead of what you told me, I changed the template for notifications to users. My purpose was instead to edit the message that arrives to the administrator (see image below) after enabling the Content Aware Alerts of the event ""Content Threat Blocked"":
[Immagine che contiene testo, schermata, Carattere, documento  Descrizione generata automaticamente]

I noticed that there are no attached files and the message does not provide specific information.

Two questions:
1- Can I edit this message by entering additional information?
2- Why is the attached file not present?

Thanks in advance!

Hi Giulia,

Thank you for letting me know that the email alert issue is solved.  Regarding your question on notifications, the portion which you are referencing is for custom notifications that are shown on the user / endpoint side.  If you wish to set custom notifications then yes, you may use this method as shown in the screenshot that you sent.  Alternatively you can use the default notification.  For notification pop-ups to show on the user's side you would need to make sure that ""Notifications Pop-up"" is enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings""

Do you want to set your own custom notifications or did you want to enable the default notifications?  could you please confirm what type of notifications you require?


Kind regards

Hi André,
thanks for the availability but I managed to fix the configuration and now the emails are sent, so the call is no longer necessary.
I just want to ask you for advice on notifications. I have set a Content Aware Protection Policy (policy action ""Block & Report"") and I would like to receive notifications.
In System Parameters > Device Types and Notifications, is it correct to create a new template in the section ""Custom Content Aware Protection Notifications"" and then in the policy in the "" Notification Template "" section select the new template created?
If yes, I configured the template as in the image. Do you have better examples of how I could configure the message?
