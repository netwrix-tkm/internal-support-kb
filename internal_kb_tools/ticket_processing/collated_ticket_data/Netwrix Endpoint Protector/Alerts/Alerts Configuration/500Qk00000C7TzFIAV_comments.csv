SELECT * FROM sysinfo WHERE name = ""begin_updating_cflogs_vpsn"";

--- CODE ---

3. if there is an audit running:



--- CODE ---
SELECT count(*) as running_audit FROM audit_backup_status WHERE ((type = 'onetime' AND (status = 1 OR started = 1)) OR (type = 'scheduled' and started = 1));

4. please provide the results of:

Please run these queries:

--- CODE ---
UPDATE `sysinfo` set `value` = 1 WHERE `name` = ""show_cflog_vpsn"";
DELETE FROM sysinfo WHERE name = 'begin_updating_cflogs_vpsn';
--- CODE ---

After running these queries, the option ""Enable Reporting V2"" will not be greyed out anymore. You can enable it and File Shadows will be available.


Please advice the customer to run an Audit log and remove some of the logs as I see they have  70 partitions of CAP logs.

Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan Customer mentioned that this is a high priority for them and that they need to have file shadows working as soon as possible.
