"500Qk00000MtOpqIAF","00438711","Support Ticket","How to Perform eDiscovery Scanning Looking for Specific Content on Select file Types Only","Hello,

We need to perform eDiscovery scans on our file shares looking for tagged documents (i.e., custom content). Given the massive size of our file shares, and the time needed to run eDiscovery scans, we want to scan only specific file types (i.e., Word, PDF).

Reading the documentation, it sounds like adding the file types to the Policy Denylist will simply report every document. Is there a way to only report those file types that contain the specific custom content we're looking for?

Thanks,
Jaimie","","","","Provided information regarding eDiscovery and CAP","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","eDiscovery","eD Policies","","","29.2","Closed - Resolved","Canada Guaranty","Jaimie Trotman","2025-03-13T14:41:29.000Z","2025-04-11T19:59:04.000Z"
