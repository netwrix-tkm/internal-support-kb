"500Qk00000BhNaxIAF","00411604","Support Ticket","Content aware protection/ Ediscovery","Trying to get an idea of how to use the create custom policy wizard. We are needing to only detect credit card info and bank routing numbers. That policy should be in alert only. 
For Ediscvoery we are looking to view data at rest and one for data in transit. 

We also have certain folders and paths that we are wanting to take special care to scan and potentially only scan those folders. Not sure how to set that up. 

We did have these defined in our POC box but since the license has expired, we are no longer seeing that information. Is it possible I can get assistance in building out these requests. The user that worked with Cososys for the POC has left our team and I am learning as I go.

Thank you,","","","","The customers asked about eDiscovery and CAP","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","eDiscovery","eD Policies","","","2.0","Closed - Resolved","ACI Worldwide US","Adam Davis","2024-06-11T13:20:52.000Z","2024-06-13T13:39:21.000Z"
