Hi Daniel,

       The search  for the computer's scan results is done exclusively in the partition that is displayed under the filters.
        As a result,  you need to navigate through the partitions to locate the corresponding scan results.

       Computer VCPL-LP-13 does not have any items found as a result of the scan.
       Computer VCPL-LP-57 has 2 items identified, which can be located by searching through the partitions one at a time.

We had a new session with customer, and we found only results that are two months old. 

If they want to check or to find results from June last year, no matter what partition they select, nothing is displayed. 

How they can find those scan results ?","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-01-27T12:21:36.000Z","2025-01-27T12:21:36.000Z","false","false"

Hi,

Partitions are time labeled.  Partition with time label June last year should be selected for the search.

Keep in mind that when a new scan is started all previous scan results are lost. An Audit Log backup for eDiscovery is recommended before starting a new scan. A message with this recommendation is displayed in a popup when starting a new scan.
