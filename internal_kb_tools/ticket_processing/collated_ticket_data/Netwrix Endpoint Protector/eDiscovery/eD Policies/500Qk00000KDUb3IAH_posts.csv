Keep in mind that when a new scan is started all previous scan results are lost. An Audit Log backup for eDiscovery is recommended before starting a new scan. A message with this recommendation is displayed in a popup when starting a new scan.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-02-04T07:26:28.000Z"
