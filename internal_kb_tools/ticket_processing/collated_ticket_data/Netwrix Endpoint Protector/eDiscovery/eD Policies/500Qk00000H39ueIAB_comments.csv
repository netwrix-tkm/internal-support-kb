@WaitingOnEngineer

I've tested this in my environment and it works fine. I noticed also in the logs that the scan starts, threats are found and some logs are sent to the EPP server. I dont know what's in the logs, but most probably the eDiscovery results. So right now I think this looks more like a server issue. For eDiscovery logs, the EPP client sends along with the results the scanID. If by any chance the server doesn't ""know"" that ID, the logs are not added in the database. It might be something related to this, but best would be if someone from the serve team will take a look.Â
