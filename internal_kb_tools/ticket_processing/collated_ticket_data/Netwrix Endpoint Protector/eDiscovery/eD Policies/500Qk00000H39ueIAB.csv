I have created the eDiscovery Policy for MacOS and Linux devices as selected file type is PDF, Excel, JPEG and SQL.

On MacOS devices, I am able to get the result of PDF files but SQL file is not scanned where SQL file is resident on the MacOS device.

On Linux devices, There is no any results are found.

2. I have configured the Email server settings on the EPP console for the Alert but getting the message is test mail sent to the mentioned email address. but we have not received any test mail also.

Please consider this case as critical priority and resolve the reported issue asap.

Regards,
