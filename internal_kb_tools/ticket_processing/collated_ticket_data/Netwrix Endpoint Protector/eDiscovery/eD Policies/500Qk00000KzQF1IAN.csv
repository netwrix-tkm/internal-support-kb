"500Qk00000KzQF1IAN","00433365","Support Ticket","Departed Employee Reports","Hi there,

We just moved over to EPP from Forcepoint and I am being asked to replicate a number of departing employee reports for the HR team. They have provided the parameters that they would use to generate these reports. It would be helpful to book some time with an engineer to see how to replicate these within our existing environment. (I don't see anywhere to attach files here so I can do that in the followups)","","We asked for more details about the issue and after receiving the answers, we asked for a remote session.

During the remote session, we answered the customer's questions about DC and CAP Logs, Denylists and Allowlists, CAP Policy editing + User Remediation feature.

The customer asked if we have the full list of US States in CAP Predefined Content - here we suggested a feature request.
The customer has a list of policies that have to be created and asked about REGEX - we answered tot that we do not offer support in creating REGEX rules and made a suggestion to try the Contextual Detection feature and also provided the link to the online documentation for this.","We are waiting for the customer's reply regarding his availability for a remote session.

We are waiting for the customer's feedback and questions after he managed to implement all their old policies into EPP.

We are waiting for the customer's feedback on our latest recommendations.","In this ticket we have answered questions about the CAP good practice, using the Allowlists and Denylists, Contextual detection, and giving details about our current CAP PII + how to get more with Feature Requests.","","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","eDiscovery","eD Policies","","","17.9","Closed - Resolved","Advisory Solutions","Anoush d'Orville","2025-01-23T17:14:23.000Z","2025-02-10T15:19:30.000Z"
