We hope you are doing well.

eDiscovery works very similarly to the Content Aware Protection module, the difference is that one monitors upload traffic and the other one monitors/scans locally for specific content in files or file types.

If you want to target a specific sensitive content and not scan locally for all the files of a specific file type you can use this section from the eDiscovery module policy:


Here you will be able to scan for specific sensitive content, no matter the file type it is present in. You will however have to remove the file types already selected, if you were already scanning for file types, so it will return only the files containing the selected sensitive content on the end users computers and not all the files they have on their machines.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide. We can also have a quick call the following days to discuss this in more detail if you would like.

Apologies for the misunderstanding!

What you can do is add all the file types that you do not want to scan to the Allowlist, and leave only the ones that you want to scan not checked in the Allowlist.

Please be aware that selecting these file types in the MIME Type allowlists apply globally and not per Policy To edit File Types. This means that it will apply to all CAP policies as well as all eDiscovery policies.

This setting can be done from Denylists and Allowlists -> Allowlists -> MIME Type:

Everything that is selected in the above screenshot will not be scanned. The remaining file types will be scanned.

Hi Flaviu,

I appreciate the proposed solution, but it won’t work for us. Because the settings are global, we’d have to allowlist/denylist all the different file types which would impact our CAP protections, cause significant user impact while the scan runs, and potentially allow exfiltration of sensitive materials.

Is this currently the only option?

Ticket Number: 00438711
Ticket Subject: How to Perform eDiscovery Scanning Looking for Specific Content on Select file Types Only
Ticket Details: Hello,

We need to perform eDiscovery scans on our file shares looking for tagged documents (i.e., custom content). Given the massive size of our file shares, and the time needed to run eDiscovery scans, we want to scan only specific file types (i.e., Word, PDF).

Reading the documentation, it sounds like adding the file types to the Policy Denylist will simply report every document. Is there a way to only report those file types that contain the specific custom content we're looking for?

Thanks,
Jaimie

Thank you!

The only other solution that I think may/could help is to create a regex/a few regex which match your search criteria. After that you can add them to the eDiscovery policy in the section below:

Ticket Number: 00438711
Ticket Subject: How to Perform eDiscovery Scanning Looking for Specific Content on Select file Types Only
Ticket Details: Hello,

We need to perform eDiscovery scans on our file shares looking for tagged documents (i.e., custom content). Given the massive size of our file shares, and the time needed to run eDiscovery scans, we want to scan only specific file types (i.e., Word, PDF).

Reading the documentation, it sounds like adding the file types to the Policy Denylist will simply report every document. Is there a way to only report those file types that contain the specific custom content we're looking for?

Thanks,
Jaimie

Thank you!

Flaviu Moldovan

Hi Jaimie,

The only other solution that I think may/could help is to create a regex/a few regex which match your search criteria. After that you can add them to the eDiscovery policy in the section below:


Unfortunately we do not offer support to configuring regexes and we strongly recommend using as few as possible, because it may affect the performance of the EPP server.

Hi Flaviu,

 

I appreciate the proposed solution, but it won’t work for us. Because the settings are global, we’d have to allowlist/denylist all the different file types which would impact our CAP protections, cause significant user impact while the scan runs, and potentially allow exfiltration of sensitive materials. 

 

Is this currently the only option?

 

Thanks,

Jaimie
