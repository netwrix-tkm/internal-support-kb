My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case.

Will you please log into the EPP console and under Device Control > Global Settings page, scroll down to bottom of the screen and you will see Display Settings > Maximum no. of records returned in a report search:.

From here you can increase the number to the size you would like to see. After selecting the number you wish to set, select Save.




Then go back to the Device Control > Computers and select the amount of entries you would like shown.

As far as the unknown device you would like to add to allowlist, is this specific to just one computer/user/group or global?

Please let me know if this works out for you and if you have further questions. 

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello.  Thanks for that info, it partially helps with what we need.  We are looking to be able to run full reports on all machines/devices, without the hinderance of it being limited to what's being shown on a single page.

The other issue is that 10k is still lower than the amount of endpoints we have reporting, so we need a way to have that be able to show everything we have that has a client checking in, in both the console and in an exportable report.  

----------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the whitelisting of items, ultimately we would like to be able to allow ALL of a single VDI/PID, without the need to limit it to a serial number.  In this instance, we are specifically looking at external DVD/CD drives and items like cameras and other devices that are mis-identified as USB storage and blocked.  

The requests come in for a single machine at a time, but that process is extremely cumbersome to do ad-hoc one at a time, when we use potentially hundreds of identical pieces of that hardware around the hospital that all need to be allowed without people needing to call the helpdesk one at a time.","Netwrix Support Ticket #439388 - Issue with client visibility of only 200 items in console and issues with bulk allowances of devices","bpthomps@hs.uci.edu","Brandon Thompson","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-20T17:11:05.000Z","true"

1. Please go to Device Control > Global Rights > Specific Devices, then select add



2. Using Device Wizard, Select device type, allow, Device Serial Number Range then select next.



3. Device Wizard (step two): enter VID and PID and for first serial number in the range enter 0 (16 times) and enter F (16 times) then select save



When you enter serial number ranges from 0000000000000000 and FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, you are including all possible serial numbers for the VID/PID.
