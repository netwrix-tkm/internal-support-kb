We have given the Device control and Enforced Encryption demo to the customer.

They need to encrypt the External storage devices automatically. and they have to use that pendrive after encryption process completed only.

When user is connected any external storage device into their laptop. One wizard will open automatically and that wizard will take to the encrypting the pendrive.


The existing Solution is Drive Lock.

Can we achieve this on our solutions. 

Regards,
