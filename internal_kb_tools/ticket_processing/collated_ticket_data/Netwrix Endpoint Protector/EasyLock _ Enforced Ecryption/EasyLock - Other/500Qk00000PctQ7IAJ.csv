He has been given the password for it but when he clicks EasyLock application gets message ""The EndPoint Protector Client is missing. EasyLock will now close."" 
Does not get the chance to put the password in. 
Looks like something needs to be installed. 
Are you able to help with this ?","","27/05/2025

Client contacted us stating that he's having issues with the EasyLock feature  as they keep getting the message ""The EndPoint Protector Client is missing. EasyLock will now close."" .

We could not find the contact account at all as they come up as a prospect.
Spoke with Sales and they could not find it either.","27/05/2025
