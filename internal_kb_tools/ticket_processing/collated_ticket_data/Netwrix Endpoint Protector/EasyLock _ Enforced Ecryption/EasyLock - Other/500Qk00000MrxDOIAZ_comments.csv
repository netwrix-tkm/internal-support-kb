@WaitingOnEngineer

This is how Easylock works.
!! Easylock allows ONLY one file to be opened at a time.
How it works?

	 - 	each file is decrypted into a temporary location
	 - 	the file can be modified or left unchanged by the customer
	 - 	when the user presses the OK button on the pop-up, the file is re-encrypted to save any modifications (if the file was modified) (please read the message box:
press ok after you made the modifications and close the file)

What the customer does?

	 - 	open the file
	 - 	press the OK button – this means the file is re-encrypted at this moment, even if no modifications were made


What happens with Notepad and why it doesn't work with Adobe Reader (for PDF files)?

Notepad opens the file with shared mode -> this allows the file to be opened by other processes at the same time.

Adobe Reader, on the other hand, opens the file without shared mode. This prevents other processes from interacting with the file

 => As a result, when the file is opened by Adobe Reader, it cannot be modified or re-encrypted by Easylock because Adobe Reader locks the file, preventing other processes from manipulating it.

This is why Easylock cannot re-encrypt the file when it's opened by Adobe Reader. (and a message appers). When the customer close the PDF file from Adobe adn the user click on ""retry"" button the pop-up disapear.
