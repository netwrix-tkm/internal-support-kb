We are experiencing an issue with the Easylock application at the customer. Even though the master password is correct, it is not being accepted and shows an ""incorrect password"" error. We successfully update the master password from the panel, but when we attempt to use it, we still encounter the same error.

Additionally, when we encrypt a new device, we can access it using the User password set during the initial encryption. However, after updating the user password from the panel, we are unable to access the device using either the old or the new password.

How can we resolve this issue?

Best Regards.","","","","f","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EasyLock / Enforced Ecryption","EasyLock - Other","","","23.7","Closed - Resolved","Alfa Elektronik Turkey","Faruk SarÄ±","2024-11-18T14:13:29.000Z","2024-12-12T07:31:12.000Z"
