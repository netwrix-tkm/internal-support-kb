Hi Lusine

We want to know what happens when an EY user copy files from an EY mac machine installed with EPP to a USB and tries to open the copied files from another EY Mac machine installed with EPP.

Will the users be prompted for password even if the EPP agent is installed and healthy.

We are performing this for testing purposes.


Thanks & Regards

Hi Jasir,

As your question is related to Endpoint Protector, I'll be happy to help here.

The user is required to input the password defined for a specific USB device regrdless if the EPP client is present or not (in the case you choose to allow users to access encrypted data on computers where the EPP client is not present by turning off the Endpoint Protector Client presence required setting available for the Global level under Device Control > Global Settings > ""Easylock Settings"" section or granular at Group/ Computer/ User level under Device Control > Groups/ Computers/ Users > right click in the entity > Manage Settings > ""Easylock Settings"" section).

Please let me know if I can help with other details.
