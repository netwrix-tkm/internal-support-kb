Let me know if we can schedule a remote session in order to investigate this issue again.
As we discovered, the issue might be related to the serial number of the storage device.

Hello Agustina,

The issue seems to be related to the device where we tried to deploy the EasyLock.
In order to ensure the compatibility with the devices we will have a new EasyLock test build which should be working fine on the device.

I did not receive the test build yet, but I will forward it to you as soon as it will be available.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

 

I remember you were part of the troubleshooting call with the affected user, but I was not able to join due to a conflict. Do you remember if this issue was specific to a specific to a USB that the user is using? And what are we actually investigating on this issue?
