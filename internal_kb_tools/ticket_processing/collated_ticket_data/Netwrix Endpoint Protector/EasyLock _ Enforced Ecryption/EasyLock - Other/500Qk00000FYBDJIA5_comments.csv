We informed our Korean partner of the procedure 56 which can be applied to fix the issue with EasyLock,  The challenge is that many of the affected customers are in closed network environments where remote sessions are not possible. So the only option is for them to wait on the release of the ISO image.  

They confirmed that they do not have root credentials to access the back-end via SSH so they won't be able to apply the procedure from their side either.

They are asking for the new ISO installation image to have the qemu guest agent and no EasyLock issue.
Here is an excerpt from the last correspondence, can we ask for feedback from the product team regarding their requirements of the new ISO image please?

Netwrix Support: 
""Do you have SSH root credentials for these appliances?""

CoSoSyS Korea: 
""Currently, all EPP products being shipped in the Korean market are running the EPP VM on a Proxmox hypervisor. Therefore.the qemu guest agent is required for the new ISO installation image your team is now building. We cannot access the SSH root account of the EPP image. The command ""apt-get install qemu-guest-agent"" needs to be executed via EPP SSH - the SSH root account for the EPP image is held by your team.""

Netwrix Support: 
""Can we also get the name of the end customer that this request is made for please?""

CoSoSyS Korea: 
""All customers using Proxmox, such as Dunamu and Hana Bank, are affected by this one. Going forward, once the new ISO installation file with the qemu guest agent included is completed and provided, we plan to proceed with the migration using System Backup v2. This is because the majority are operating within closed networks.""

Netwrix Support: 
""We have an existing procedure which was implemented to fix a master password reset issue that was identified for Enforced Encryption.  I have applied this same procedure on the test EPP appliance deployed from the Korean installation ISO and can confirm that it also solves the issue reported in this case where EasyLock opens without a password being entered.  To apply this fix, remote sessions will be needed with the end customers and the procedure perform via SSH to the backend of the EPP appliance.  Please be also informed that new install images based on 5940 resources (with above fix included) are currently in development.""

CoSoSyS Korea: 
""As mentioned above, many of the affected customers are in closed network environments where remote sessions are not possible. Once the new ISO installation image with the qemu guest agent and no EasyLock issue is provided, we plan to address this issue via the migration using System Backup v2.""","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-09-13T12:29:48.000Z","2024-09-13T12:29:48.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Backend procedure will be eliminated in two approach:

	 - 	5.9.4.1 patch will fix the issue (backend procedure most probably will be no longer needed - still being test by QA)

	 - 	New Ubuntu22 5940 image migration, where backend procedure is already hardcoded.

I can't offer you fix both deadlines, but 5941 is expected ~2nd part of November, new Ubuntu22 5940 images for OVF, AWS, AWS hosted next week, and for Azure, GCP, Hyper-V ~3+ weeks from now.
