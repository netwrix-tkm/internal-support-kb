When connecting an encrypted USB device while the rights are set to Allow TD1+/TD1 the auto-run functionality is started. It should be the same as launching it manually.

I assume the auto-run functionality is just the Endpoint Protector client launching EasyLock instead of the user. Do you know what part of the client does that, is it the Endpoint Protector service, EPPNotifier.exe or EasyLockLauncher.exe?

Hi Sean,

It should be EasyLockLauncher.exe.

EasyLockLauncher.exe - Launches the EasyLock application.

EPPNotifier.exe - is related to the EPP client icon and its functionalities.

Thanks Flaviu,

 

I assume the auto-run functionality is just the Endpoint Protector client launching EasyLock instead of the user. Do you know what part of the client does that, is it the Endpoint Protector service, EPPNotifier.exe or EasyLockLauncher.exe?

Hi Sean,

Unfortunately we did not yet receive an update on the Easylock issue.

I have chased internally with my colleagues and asked them to provide an update. I will get back to you as soon as I hear back from them.

When connecting an encrypted USB device while the rights are set to Allow TD1+/TD1 the auto-run functionality is started. It should be the same as launching it manually.

I have received the below explanation regarding the last question you raised:

EasyLockLauncher detects when EasyLock is on a USB and then launches it. This can be done through the ""Send To"" / ""EasyLock"" action our product makes available in Windows Explorer. It works in conjunction with TD Level 1 Rights.

I will keep you posted as soon as I receive updates on the case with the USB Rights not applied on Windows 11 computers.

Thanks Flaviu,

 

Does the EasyLockLauncher detect when EasyLock is on a USB and then launches it or does it use another method? Like having the EPPNotifier do the detection and call the EasyLockLauncher to launch it.

Are you able to send me some more detailed steps for how the EPPService notices and automatically opens EasyLock on a USB when the TD1 or TD1+ right is used? When using the TD1+ otherwise Read Only right I get prompted to launch EasyLock by EPP, but with the TD1 or TD1+ right I'm not getting any prompt or auto launch of EasyLock.

I have some Process Monitor captures but I'm trying to look for where the EPPService or EPPNotifier actually detects and launches EasyLock when using the when TD1 or TD1+ right. Since I want to know if its even attempting to launch EasyLock or if something is interfering with or bugging out.

I can also do another meeting with you or the engineering team if you want to take a deeper dive/collect more data.

Thanks Flaviu,

 

Are you able to send me some more detailed steps for how the EPPService notices and automatically opens EasyLock on a USB when the TD1 or TD1+ right is used? When using the TD1+ otherwise Read Only right I get prompted to launch EasyLock by EPP, but with the TD1 or TD1+ right I’m not getting any prompt or auto launch of EasyLock.

 

I have some Process Monitor captures but I’m trying to look for where the EPPService or EPPNotifier actually detects and launches EasyLock when using the when TD1 or TD1+ right. Since I want to know if its even attempting to launch EasyLock or if something is interfering with or bugging out.

 

I can also do another meeting with you or the engineering team if you want to take a deeper dive/collect more data.

Hi Sean,

I have received another update on this from our engineers:

On Windows when TD1 or TD1+ right is used the root of the device cannot be accessed, ONLY the Easylock can be accessed. The Easylock app will prompt to the user(will be open) when the USB device is connected and the USB is available ONLY using Easylock.

Regarding the question: Does the EasyLockLauncher detect when EasyLock is on a USB and then launches it or does it use another method? Like having the EPPNotifier do the detection and call the EasyLockLauncher to launch it.

Answer: The epp agent will detect the Easylock if it is on USB device, NOT the EasyLockLauncher.

Please let me know if this helps.

Hi Sean,

I have received a question from my colleagues regarding this issue.

They asked if the USB stick has multiple partitions(multipartition). Please let me know if this is the case, or if it is a normal single partition USB.
