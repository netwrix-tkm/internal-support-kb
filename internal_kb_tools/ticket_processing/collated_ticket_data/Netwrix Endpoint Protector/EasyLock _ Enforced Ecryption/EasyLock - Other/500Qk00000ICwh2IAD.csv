"500Qk00000ICwh2IAD","00426809","Support Ticket","Master Password Issues","Currently in a trial of Endpoint Defender's device control. EasyLock installs and sets up just fine on a USB drive and I'm able to unlock a drive with the user created password, however any time I try to unlock a drive using the master password that was set up in the EasyLock configuration, I get a message saying the incorrect password was entered. Any insight into this would be appreciated. Thanks.","","","","Closing ticket as resolved.
