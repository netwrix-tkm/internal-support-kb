Our users are reporting that the default functionality of EPP is restricting the work. 

When a USB recipient opens the EPP encrypted USB, they are only able to open 1 document at a time.  If they try to open another file from the EPP container - they get a warning message that please close the previous file.

Is there something we can do to avoid this behavior? This way, users will not have to copy everything to work on different documents at same time.

Regards,
Karan","","","Waiting on R&D.

testing internally to see if issue reproduces itself.","The behavior that happens with the PDF files is the way that Easylock works. Easylock allows only one file to be opened at a time.

Please find below the detailed explanation of the behavior:
 - each file is decrypted into a temporary location
 - the file can be modified or left unchanged by the end user
 - when the end user presses the OK button on the pop-up, the file is re-encrypted to save any modifications(if the file was modified; message box:
press ok after you made the modifications and close the file)

What we did:
 - open the file
 - press the OK button â€“ this means the file is re-encrypted at this moment, even if no modifications were made


What happens with Notepad and why it doesn't work with Adobe Reader (for PDF files)?
Answer: Notepad opens the file with shared mode -> this allows the file to be opened by other processes at the same time.

Adobe Reader, on the other hand, opens the file without shared mode. This prevents other processes from interacting with the file -> as a result, when the file is opened by Adobe Reader, it cannot be modified or re-encrypted by Easylock because Adobe Reader locks the file, preventing other processes from manipulating it.

This is why Easylock cannot re-encrypt the file when it's opened by Adobe Reader(and a message appears). When the end user closes the PDF file from Adobe and the user click on ""retry"" button the pop-up will disappear.","Best Practices Question","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EasyLock / Enforced Ecryption","EasyLock - Other","","","54.7","Closed - Resolved","Bennett Jones Services Limited","Karan Bhagat","2025-03-12T21:43:20.000Z","2025-05-06T15:10:48.000Z"
