"500Qk00000KjDthIAF","00432536","Support Ticket","Question about Enforced Encryption deployment","Hello,

We have questions about potentially using Enforced Encryption on some Windows hosts. We are not currently licensed for it and we only use EndPro for device control on Macs to enforce that users use FileVault on removable storage devices. In our transition from one removable storage device encryption product to another one, we discovered some limitations that are problematic and are looking for some alternatives for Windows edge cases. Specifically we would only use this on Windows hosts.

I cannot seem to find specifications and limitations of the product, in particular what the limitations are of the product in terms of single file size, max encrypted volume size, total number of files on an encrypted volume, and number of files in a folder on an encrypted volume.

Assuming the limitations of Enforced Encryption would help us overcome these Windows edge cases and we then purchased some licenses, what would this mean for our device controlled Macs? Since Enforced Encryption is a Trusted Device level 1 and we are managing our Macs to enforce FileVault with ""Allow Access if TD level 3+, otherwise read only"", that would mean downgrading the settings to ""Allow Access if TD level 1+, otherwise read only"" in order to use Enforced Encryption on Windows hosts, correct? What impact would that have on our Macs? Would this break the ability to enforce that the Mac users encrypt removable storage devices with FileVault?

Thanks very much,
Jacques","","- Customer cannot seem to find specifications and limitations of EPP.
