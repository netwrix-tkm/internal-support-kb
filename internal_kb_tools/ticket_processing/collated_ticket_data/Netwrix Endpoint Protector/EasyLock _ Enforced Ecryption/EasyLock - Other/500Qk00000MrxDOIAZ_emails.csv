Hello Cristian,
I think that was always the case. Is this not something you have heard before or something fixed with latest version of EPP agent?

We have 5.7x agent version which we working to upgrade across the firm this weekend to 6.2.4.1010

Karan

Hello Cristian,
I think that was always the case. Is this not something you have heard before or something fixed with latest version of EPP agent?

We have 5.7x agent version which we working to upgrade across the firm this weekend to 6.2.4.1010

Regards,
Karan

HI Karan,

If I understand this right, the behavior was not the same until now?

Can you please let us know what is the current version of Easy Lock that you are using and if you upgraded the EPP agents recently?

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Karan,

We have tested this use case internally and it seems to work as expected with the latest Easylock and EPP client version.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week and we will take a look together.

We would need access to the computer of an affected end user.
