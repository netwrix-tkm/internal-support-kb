I received the below question from the customer regarding Easylock: Does the EasyLockLauncher detect when EasyLock is on a USB and then launches it or does it use another method? Like having the EPPNotifier do the detection and call the EasyLockLauncher to launch it.

Please also advise on this.

@WaitingOnEngineer
I saw the uploaded video and “Trusted Level 1” and “Trusted Level 1+” works as expected.

On Windows when TD1 or TD1+ right is used the root of the device cannot be accessed, ONLY the Easylock can be accessed. The Easylock app will prompt to the user (will be open) when the USB device is connected and the USB is available ONLY using Easylock.

Does the EasyLockLauncher detect when EasyLock is on a USB and then launches it or does it use another method? Like having the EPPNotifier do the detection and call the EasyLockLauncher to launch it.
The epp agent will detect the Easylock if it is on USB device, NOT the EasyLockLauncher.


!!! Very important: I observed you tried multiple times to collect data in eppclient.log (if eppclient_append.log is available all the data will be write in eppclient.log file).

If you want to populate eppclient.log file you must to delete eppclient_append.log.

Thank you! I have provided the below answers to the customer.

The main reason the ticket was open is in the description of the ticket:

The customer noticed that after upgrading to Windows11 several machines no longer had the USB rights applied.

This affected mostly ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1"" and ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1+"" rights. Instead of these rights being applied the behavior was that USB devices with Easylock installed were mounted(seen in Windows Explorer), but when accessed they gave Deny Access message.

If the rights were set to ""Allow Access if TD 1+, otherwise Read Only"" it worked as expected.

Setup Details:
Rights: Use Both -> Computer prio
Checked Global -> Computer Group -> Computer and the USB device Rights. They were okay. No missconfiguration.

Made a recording of the issue and how we generated logs. There was an issue with generating the eppclient.log file(it got deleted after generation or was with size 0 kb) and we could only get a very large appended log file.

Video recordings + Logs + screenshots:
https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00425729

The customer would like the ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1"" and ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1+"" rights to work as expected.

Please advise.

""Are you able to send me some more detailed steps for how the EPPService notices and automatically opens EasyLock on a USB when the TD1 or TD1+ right is used? When using the TD1+ otherwise Read Only right I get prompted to launch EasyLock by EPP, but with the TD1 or TD1+ right I’m not getting any prompt or auto launch of EasyLock.

I have some Process Monitor captures but I’m trying to look for where the EPPService or EPPNotifier actually detects and launches EasyLock when using the when TD1 or TD1+ right. Since I want to know if its even attempting to launch EasyLock or if something is interfering with or bugging out.

I can also do another meeting with you or the engineering team if you want to take a deeper dive/collect more data.""

What the customer wants? I cannot understand if it is something wrong or just a curiosity of the customer?

What is the root problem if this item?


 In description we have the following expected result:
 The customer would like the ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1"" 
and ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1+"" rights to work as 
expected.

-> I explained, the rights works as expected

Are you able to send me some more detailed steps for how the EPPService notices and automatically opens EasyLock on a USB when the TD1 or TD1+ right is used?

What we can share related to these rights is:
when the USB device is connected to the computer, the agent checks if the Easylock executable is on USB device and verify the app signature to NOT start other executable which can be a virus (this is a security and mandatory check made by our agent). Only the rights EASYLOCK will be started by out EPP agent.

This is how these rights were implemented (these is how the rights works) and using this rights the USB device is available ONLY via Easylock (when the usb is connected physically to the computer the application (Easylock application) will start. The application is not opened by the EPP notifier (is opened by the EPP client).

When using the TD1+ otherwise Read Only right I get prompted to launch EasyLock by EPP

Related to this part, this is how the mentioned right works.
When a USB device is connected to the computer, the right will be read only.
Starting the Easylock application the device will have TD1+ rights (this means the root of the volume is NOT available).
When the Easylock app is closed => the device will be again on read only right (this is how it works).
The pop-up message box is displayed ONLY on this right because this was by design: using this right TD1+ otherwise Read Only, the user can choose the wanted right (read only or td1+).
Writing on the usb device can be made only using Easylock, but data can be copied from usb device (on read only right).

Please collect logs and send to us to see what is happening.

If I am not wrong, the problem is the Easylock is not started on a USB device with a single partition.

As requested we had another remote session with the customer and we replicated the issue again with the 5941 agent.

Issue: ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1"" and ""Allow Access if Trusted Devices Level 1+"" -> does not autorun/autostart the Easylock app when the USB is connected to the computer. If we set the right to:  ""Allow Access if TD 1+, otherwise Read Only -> we are able to explore the USB and also start Easylock from within the USB(so Easylock technically works, but when TD1 and TD1+ rights are set it doesn't autostart).

I think here is other problem with other app, related to Device Guard which is a security feature available in Windows.


This is from logs:

Error 4551 = Your organization used Device Guard to block this app. Contact your support person for more info.


The customer knows about this security feature?
This Device Guard was activated by the company administrator?
