@WaitingOnEngineer

We know about the problem and was debated multiple times in many other ticket. @Krzysztof Staszalek

This problem is related to Ubuntu 22 or PHP extension. IF you remember 2 solutions were delivered related to this bug:

	 - 	made the workaround installing ""locale"" on Ubuntu 22 (this method is ok and will work if the USB device will be format -- the USB device must to be formatted or newly installed on usb device). The steps were described in ""backend procedure"".


	 - 	I don't know in which version of patch the PHP extension will be available

If you have other questions related to this ticket please talk with PM. @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Krzysztof Staszalek

@WaitingOnEngineer backend procedure for this item is available since over the year. Please follow it, or wait for 5941 release which will contain hard fix for it. 

@Stacy Petruzzi is another example about wrong population of well known issues inside support team.

We have applied the steps from the Backend procedure in the session we had and the issue persist. 

The USB used was formatted, however, when the passwords are changed, it does not accept them.

It could be that this customer has a particular issue and need a look from one of our colleagues.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-12-09T12:34:36.000Z","2024-12-09T12:34:36.000Z","false","false"

Ticket can be closed: 

We have resolved the issue. We can close the ticket.

The problem was caused by the agents communicating via FQDN instead of IP addresses. Once we updated the agents to communicate using IP addresses, the issues were resolved.

There are no problems in general usage, but an issue arises with EasyLock passwords when used in this way. You may report this to the development team. The EasyLock password section needs to be checked. FYI.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-12-12T07:30:14.000Z","2024-12-12T07:30:14.000Z","false","false"
