Our users are reporting that the default functionality of EPP is restricting the work. 

When a USB recipient opens the EPP encrypted USB, they are only able to open 1 document at a time.  If they try to open another file from the EPP container - they get a warning message that please close the previous file.

Is there something we can do to avoid this behavior? This way, users will not have to copy everything to work on different documents at same time.

Regards,
Karan","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-12T21:43:22.000Z"
