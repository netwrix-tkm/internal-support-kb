I have noticed that the Easylock is in the Windows context menu.
We only have the Device Control module and this is currently causing confusion as it cannot be used either.
Please take a look at the screenshot.
The button has no function.
Can this entry be removed?

Thank you and best regards
Paul Eisermann","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-13T15:13:01.000Z"
