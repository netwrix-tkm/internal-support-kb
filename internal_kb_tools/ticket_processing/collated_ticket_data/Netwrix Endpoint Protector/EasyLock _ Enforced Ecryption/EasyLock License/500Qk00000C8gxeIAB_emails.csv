Thanks for reaching out!
You can try the following steps to see if they fix the issue, and if they don't, we can schedule a remote session to take a look together:

	Set the USB device on allow right under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Right Click on the device > ""Manage Rights"" (Be sure that the USB storage device is accessible).  Alternatively you can connect the USB storage device to a computer which does not have Endpoint Protector installed.
	Navigate to hidden folder "".EasyLock Settings"" and delete the file labeled ""cs14c7el.data"".
	Delete the executable file ""EasyLock.exe"" from the root of the USB storage device.
	Download the EasyLock utility executable from the following link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EasyLock_util.zip  ; Extract the file ""EasyLock_util.exe"" to the root location of the USB Storage Device and run it.
	Download EasyLock package from the Endpoint Protector Server and copy it directly to the root of the selected USB storage device, extract all files and overwrite existing files.
	Open the EasyLock ""EasyLock.exe"" from the USB Storage device and enter password.

Regarding the reset of the EasyLock master password, I can do it from my end, I would just like to ask for your permission to access the back end of your server.
