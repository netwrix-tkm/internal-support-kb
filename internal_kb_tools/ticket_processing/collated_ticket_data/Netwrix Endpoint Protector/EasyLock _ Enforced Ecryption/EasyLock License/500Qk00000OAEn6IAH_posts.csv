- When the user inserted the flash drive, EasyLock prompted a recovery process due to an expired license.

- We completed the recovery process and successfully retrieved the user’s file.

- The user then unplugged and reinserted the flash drive. They performed a reset to default settings and created a new password.

- The user attempted to save a PowerPoint file to the drive. After closing EasyLock and reinserting the drive, the application again prompted recovery and still indicated an expired license.

- The user then tried a second USB flash drive for encryption. This time, there was no license expiration message.

- We verified the second flash drive functioned correctly. The user was able to sign into EasyLock and access the PowerPoint file.

- Accessed the Endpoint Protector Management Console and confirmed that the user’s EP client is currently licensed.

Additional Information:
We recently experienced a shortage of Endpoint Protector licenses and were issued temporary licenses, which have been in use since last week. Our current license count is 11,801, with 11,524 in use.

Request for Clarification:
We would like to understand the expected behavior of encrypted devices when a license expires or is unavailable. Specifically:

- Do encrypted USB devices automatically reacquire a license once available?

- Or must the drives be re-encrypted in order to function properly again?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-17T16:13:28.000Z"
