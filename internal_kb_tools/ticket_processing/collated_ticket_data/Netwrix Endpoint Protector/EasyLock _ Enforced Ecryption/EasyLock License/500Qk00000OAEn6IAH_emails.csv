Hi Ramon,

Our EPP Appliance is currently on version 5.9.4.1

[image.png]

I will consult with my team on upgrading our EPP Appliance. Can you please provide detailed information on what the upgrade process entails? How should we prepare for it, and will the upgrade automatically update the agents already deployed in our environment? Additionally, what are the benefits of upgrading at this time?

Regarding the ticket submitted, is the licensing error in this scenario caused by the EPP Appliance?

Thank you,

Please refer to the following link: https://community.netwrix.com/t/version-5-9-4-2-released/3466

With EPP version 5.9.4.2, Easy Lock will use Enforced Encryption FIPS 140-3 Validated Engine, which introduces Netwrix Enforced Encryption Read-Only Mode for unmanaged computers. Please go to link above for further details.

The upgrade process begins with creating a snapshot of your current EPP Appliance. After that, please contact us to schedule a remote session during which we will assist you in downloading the EPP upgrade file. Once the snapshot is created and the upgrade package has been downloaded, we will log in to the EPP UI and start the installation.

The time required for installation can vary based on the size of your database; a backup of the EPP database is performed before the actual installation. Afterward, we can push the upgraded agent software to your devices by navigating to System Configuration → Client Software Upgrade in the EPP UI and selecting the computers to upgrade.

Upgrading to EPP 5.9.4.2 will enhance security for offline file tracing with enforced encryption.

Please review the link provided, and let me know if you decide to proceed with EPP 5.9.4.2.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Daniel,

Please refer to the following link: https://community.netwrix.com/t/version-5-9-4-2-released/3466

With EPP version 5.9.4.2, Easy Lock will use Enforced Encryption FIPS 140-3 Validated Engine, which introduces Netwrix Enforced Encryption Read-Only Mode for unmanaged computers. Please go to link above for further details.

The upgrade process begins with creating a snapshot of your current EPP Appliance. After that, please contact us to schedule a remote session during which we will assist you in downloading the EPP upgrade file. Once the snapshot is created and the upgrade package has been downloaded, we will log in to the EPP UI and start the installation.

The time required for installation can vary based on the size of your database; a backup of the EPP database is performed before the actual installation. Afterward, we can push the upgraded agent software to your devices by navigating to System Configuration → Client Software Upgrade in the EPP UI and selecting the computers to upgrade.

Upgrading to EPP 5.9.4.2 will enhance security for offline file tracing with enforced encryption.

Please review the link provided, and let me know if you decide to proceed with EPP 5.9.4.2.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ramon,


 

Our EPP Appliance is currently on version 5.9.4.1

 



 


I will consult with my team on upgrading our EPP Appliance. Can you please provide detailed information on what the upgrade process entails? How should we prepare for it, and will the upgrade automatically update the agents already deployed in our environment? Additionally, what are the benefits of upgrading at this time?

 

Regarding the ticket submitted, is the licensing error in this scenario caused by the EPP Appliance? 
 

Thank you,
