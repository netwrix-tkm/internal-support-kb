Here is an update on the progress of clearing space on your EPP Appliance. I have removed as much data as possible from the backend, reducing disk usage from 65% to 52%.

We recommend that you migrate to a newer appliance which will have more space to work with. 

Would you be interested in migrating to a newer EPP Appliance?

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Thank you.
