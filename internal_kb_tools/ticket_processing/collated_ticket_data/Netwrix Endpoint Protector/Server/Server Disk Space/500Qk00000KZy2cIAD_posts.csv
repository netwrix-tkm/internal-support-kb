The folder ""backup"" these are automatic backups (these backups are automatically created in the backend which can be used in emergency situations to restore a recent backup of the SQL databases). The older backups are rarely or never required.  We usually clean this folder up by deleting the older backups, but leaving the last three backups which are sufficient in case we need to do an emergency restore of your database.  Please let me know if I may proceed delete the older backups and leave the last three.

The folder ""mysql"", this folder contains your live database.  To reduce this size we recommend that you make use of audit log backups and delete older event logs which may not required or necessary to be present and accessible on the EPP Server's UI.  You can archive these older event logs and store them on an external storage location.  We can discuss this into more detail in a remote session and decide on what option would be best suitable for your organization.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-12T12:16:31.000Z"
