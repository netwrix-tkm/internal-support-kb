EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected."" 

We currently have audit backups scheduled automatically, and our understanding is there isn't anything else that can be done here to free up storage.

Botond ran some commands to reduce the used storage when he was remoted in for our license issue since we noticed the issue was happening then.  Since then, the remaining storage space is now smaller.

We would like assistance either expanding the partition to the remaining 2TB's of the disk, or another long term solution to the storage filling up.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-25T17:04:46.000Z"
