"500Qk00000GG04VIAT","00422122","Support Ticket","Log files not deleting - Disk space at 7%","Good afternoon,

Our hosted EPP server is alerting us on a disk space issue, this is due to log files according to the system. After heading to the log file backup section, I can see that I have all boxes for ""Keep backed up logs"" and ""keep backed up shadows"" UNCHECKED. For some reason, the logs are still not deleting...I am unsure of what I am doing wrong and I am afraid the system will fail soon. Can someone take a look at my tenant and let me know what I am doing wrong please?","","","","The disk space was occupied by the alerts emails not being sent from the server to the configured SMTP server due to firewall restrictions. The disk space was cleaned from the backend and the customer decided to delete the alerts until the SMTP-Firewall configuration will be fixed internally.","","Iosif Muntean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","12.0","Closed - Resolved","BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont","Elias LaCount","2024-09-25T18:48:31.000Z","2024-10-07T19:20:52.000Z"
