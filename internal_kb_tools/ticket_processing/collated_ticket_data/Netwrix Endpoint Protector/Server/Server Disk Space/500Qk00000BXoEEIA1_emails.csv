I apologize for the late reply as we have switched to the new ticketing system from Netwrix. Email 2 case will not work anymore so please use the new portal in the future. You should have an email regarding this.

I removed some old backup files but nothing seems in a critical state.
One thing I noticed is that there are a lot of syslog-ng files which an error with the SIEM integration could cause

Hi Zach,

I apologize for the late reply as we have switched to the new ticketing system from Netwrix. Email 2 case will not work anymore so please use the new portal in the future. You should have an email regarding this.
Per your issue, is it okay if I check the disk space in the backend in your absence?
I will get back with the findings.

Thank you,

The message that the appliance is running low on space is showing up again. A new audit log backup hasn't run so I am unsure of what could cause it.

That is good to hear. I have seen some large files regarding syslog-ng and I would like to see if they are expected by our server team or if they should be removed.

Hi Zach,

I apologize for the late reply as we have switched to the new ticketing system from Netwrix. Email 2 case will not work anymore so please use the new portal in the future. You should have an email regarding this.
Per your issue, is it okay if I check the disk space in the backend in your absence?
I will get back with the findings.

In that case is it okay if I remove the logs file for the SIEM from Nov? They will not be sent since they have the headers for the old Integration.

Hello Eduard,

 

Sounds good. We switched to a new platform for our SIEM earlier this year so we don’t have the logs for Nov 2023, but we have logs dating back to the change which was in March.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

I will submit an access request and will take a look. It might be due to those SIEM log files, and if you have all logs, I have already asked if they can be removed or emptied.
Please check in your SIEM server if you have logs from Nov 2023 and let me know.

Hello Eduard,

 

The message that the appliance is running low on space is showing up again. A new audit log backup hasn’t run so I am unsure of what could cause it.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

That is good to hear. I have seen some large files regarding syslog-ng and I would like to see if they are expected by our server team or if they should be removed.
Please let me check and get back to you next week with my findings, and then if all is okay I will close the case.

Hello Eduard,

 

I turned off the integration and then back on. We look to be getting all the logs still. The low disk space messaged has also disappeared. I think we are good to go. Many thanks.

Hi Zach,

I removed some old backup files but nothing seems in a critical state.
One thing I noticed is that there are a lot of syslog-ng files which an error with the SIEM integration could cause
Please turn the integration off and then on again and check to see if you have all the logs in there and let me know.

I have freed up some space and there still is a file that I cannot remove that is very large. I have asked about it and am waiting for a reply.
Will update you as soon as I can.

Hi Zach,

In that case is it okay if I remove the logs file for the SIEM from Nov? They will not be sent since they have the headers for the old Integration.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

Sounds good. We switched to a new platform for our SIEM earlier this year so we don’t have the logs for Nov 2023, but we have logs dating back to the change which was in March.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

I will submit an access request and will take a look. It might be due to those SIEM log files, and if you have all logs, I have already asked if they can be removed or emptied.
Please check in your SIEM server if you have logs from Nov 2023 and let me know.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

The message that the appliance is running low on space is showing up again. A new audit log backup hasn’t run so I am unsure of what could cause it.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

That is good to hear. I have seen some large files regarding syslog-ng and I would like to see if they are expected by our server team or if they should be removed.
Please let me check and get back to you next week with my findings, and then if all is okay I will close the case.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

I turned off the integration and then back on. We look to be getting all the logs still. The low disk space messaged has also disappeared. I think we are good to go. Many thanks.

Hi Zach,

I removed some old backup files but nothing seems in a critical state.
One thing I noticed is that there are a lot of syslog-ng files which an error with the SIEM integration could cause
Please turn the integration off and then on again and check to see if you have all the logs in there and let me know.

Thank you,

Hi Zach,

I apologize for the late reply as we have switched to the new ticketing system from Netwrix. Email 2 case will not work anymore so please use the new portal in the future. You should have an email regarding this.
Per your issue, is it okay if I check the disk space in the backend in your absence?
I will get back with the findings.

Thank you,
