We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom

 Hi Akash,

 

 We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

 Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

 https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

 

 As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
 This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 

 Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 -Putty
 -Zoom
 

 

 Kind regards

Hi Akash,

 

We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Hi Akash,

 

We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

 

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
 This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 -Putty
 -Zoom
 

 

Kind regards

Hello Team,

The customer was connected to the shared meeting, but unfortunately, no one joined from your side. The customer is now frustrated as the case has been open for more than a week, and the meeting has already been rescheduled multiple times. The customer is facing issues (LG) accessing the server.

Please prioritize this case and reschedule the meeting for today at 6 PM or tomorrow at 11 AM. We are looking for your prompt response and action on this matter.

Thank you for your attention.



Thanks & Regards,

Akash S.

Hello Team,

 

The customer was connected to the shared meeting, but unfortunately, no one joined from your side. The customer is now frustrated as the case has been open for more than a week, and the meeting has already been rescheduled multiple times. The customer is facing issues (LAG) accessing the server.



Please prioritize this case and reschedule the meeting for today at 6 PM (IST) or tomorrow at 11 AM (IST). We are looking for your prompt response and action on this matter.



Thank you for your attention.

Hi Akash,

 

We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

 

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
 This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 -Putty
 -Zoom
 

 

Kind regards

Hi Akash,

 

We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

 

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

 

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom

 

 

Kind regards

Hi Akash,

 

We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.

 

Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:

https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1

 

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

 

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom

 

 

Kind regards

Hi Akash,



 



We have arranged a remote session for today at 2:30 PM IST.



 



Click the link below to join the remote session at the specified time:



https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/89719271327?pwd=XtGz5iutMjJrsM14SzyF2DJFqaZZNZ.1



 



As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have customer prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of their Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.



 



Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom



 



 



Kind regards
