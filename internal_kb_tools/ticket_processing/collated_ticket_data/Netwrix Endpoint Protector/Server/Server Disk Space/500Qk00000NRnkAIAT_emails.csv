If your EPP appliance is hosted in our AWS, we can do some backend validation and cleanup, but we would need your written approval as a reply to this message.

Our server is hosted by you all so I have no clue which cloud provider is
being used. We approve any cleanup work that you believe is necessary so
long as we can maintain all log backups created in 2025 as well as any
shadow files that are associated with active endpoints.

We have completed the cleanup for the system partition, ensuring that no logs or shadows were deleted in the process. Please note that the EPP UI may take 15-20 minutes to update and reflect the actual disk space.

Once you've had a chance to verify the changes, please let us know if you need any further assistance or if we should proceed with closing the ticket.

Thanks for that, it looks like we're down to 58% utilization and the banner
message has cleared.  Is there any way to get a larger System partition or
are we limited on how much storage we can have on our instance?

Thank you for the update.

It's normal for the system partition to be occupied 40-60% of the time. However, in rare cases, the system logs rotation malfunction or other factors that can cause storage issues, triggering an alert in the UI. In such cases, you can always contact us, and we'll address it promptly.

Certain server disks can be increased, although this will incur additional costs. However, for the system partition specifically, you'll need to request a new server and migrate the data from the current one. Generally, it's not worthwhile to do so for the system partition, as space issues are very rare.

Yeah, that doesn't sound worth the effort to me either.  I'll just keep an
eye on it and if it ever starts to creep upward again I'll reach back out.

Thanks again and feel free to close this out.
