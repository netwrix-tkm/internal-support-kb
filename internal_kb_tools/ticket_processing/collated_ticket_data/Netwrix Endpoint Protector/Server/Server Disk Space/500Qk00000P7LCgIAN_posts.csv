We’ve noticed that disk space on our Netwrix Endpoint Protector server is being consumed at a rate of approximately 2-3 GB per day. This is occurring despite not having any recurring system backups scheduled. We're currently using up 72% of the available 50 GB disk space for the system.

Could you help us investigate what might be causing this continual growth in disk usage and recommend any steps to manage or clean up unnecessary files?

I’m based in the PT time zone if you’d like to coordinate a session.

Best regards,
Philip","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-13T17:20:14.000Z"
