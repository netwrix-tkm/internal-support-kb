We presented the two option that they have, either we can remote through a KVM or we can provide them an offline patch with an additional account where they can access the backend of their EPP server and do the modifications themselves but that would require for him to sign the disclaimer and we would not be responsible for the damages that might occur.
Hamad and us agreed to proceed rather with the KVM option and he said it will take some time to get the proper approval and we just agreed to close the case as soon as he replies back and will open a new one when the time comes.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-05T09:42:36.000Z"
