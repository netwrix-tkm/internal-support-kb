Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we rebooted the EPP server since it was not rebooted in over 500days.

The System Disk space had around 5.88GB free. This space is enough for the EPP server to work fine. We tried to ssh into the backend of the EPP server, but since it is hosted in AWS we would need port 62828 to be open for your IP(the IP of the computer from which we will connect to the backend). We asked that you make a request for the port to be open.

We scheduled another remote session from 01:00pm PDT next week on Tuesday. We will try to do the following in that remote session:
- check if the database is on the System Disk Partition and move it if needed
- archive the Server journal file
- clear caches
- clear other non-necessary files

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we rebooted the EPP server since it was not rebooted in over 500days.

The System Disk space had around 5.88GB free. This space is enough for the EPP server to work fine. We tried to ssh into the backend of the EPP server, but since it is hosted in AWS we would need port 62828 to be open for your IP(the IP of the computer from which we will connect to the backend). We asked that you make a request for the port to be open.

We scheduled another remote session from 01:00pm PDT next week on Tuesday. We will try to do the following in that remote session:
- check if the database is on the System Disk Partition and move it if needed
- archive the Server journal file
- clear caches
- clear other non-necessary files

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we rebooted the EPP server since it was not rebooted in over 500days.

The System Disk space had around 5.88GB free. This space is enough for the EPP server to work fine. We tried to ssh into the backend of the EPP server, but since it is hosted in AWS we would need port 62828 to be open for your IP(the IP of the computer from which we will connect to the backend). We asked that you make a request for the port to be open.

We scheduled another remote session from 01:00pm PDT next week on Tuesday. We will try to do the following in that remote session:
- check if the database is on the System Disk Partition and move it if needed
- archive the Server journal file
- clear caches
- clear other non-necessary files
