Hey Bharani,

When you go to Appliance -> Server Information, what do you see as the disk space?
If they are both green, please reboot the server from the hypervisor and check again after 20 minutes.

When you go to Appliance -> Server Information, what do you see as the disk space?
If they are both green, please reboot the server from the hypervisor and check again after 20 minutes.

Hi Edward,

The whitelist rule hasn’t helped yet. I still see traffic. Can we connect at 2pm PST to revisit it ?

 

Reg,

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Ticket Number: 00424726
Ticket Subject: Server low disk space
Ticket Details: Hi Team,
We came across this issue of low disk space on our newer server last day and we added an extra 20GB on GCP and that didnt seem to do the trick and we got prompted for a notification stating 3.4gb only available. Can we connect on a call to clear some older files from the backend please ?

Thank you!
