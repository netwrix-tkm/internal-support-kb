Hi Heather,

Thank you! We have cleared some pace in the backend. You should be now at around 52% disk space occupied from 80%. Please allow around 15 minutes for changes to replicare on the EPP server UI end.

Please be aware that I saw that the periodic database backups were occupying a lot of space, and as these are done every 3 or so days the issue may come back in a few weeks/months.

In order to prevent this please try:
- using the Audit Log Backup functionality -> it will archive the logs and remove them from the EPP server(you can apply this to old logs).
- this functionality can be enabled from System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup

Please let me know if we can close this ticket.

Hi Heather,

I checked and your EPP server is hosted on our end.

Please let me know if I have your approval to access it and take a look.
