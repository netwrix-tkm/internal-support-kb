""Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 6.71 gb free available from 19.52 gb (34%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.""

We saw the same message back in January and already have backups in place. Is there a way to prevent it from happening again? I'll attach a screenshot of the backup schedule we have in case there are any adjustments we should make.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-25T20:49:41.000Z"
