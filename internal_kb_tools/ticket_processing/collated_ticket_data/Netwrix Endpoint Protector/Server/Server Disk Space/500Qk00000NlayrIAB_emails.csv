Thank you for reaching out!!

Could you please let us know your availability for this week, so we can schedule a remote session ? 

 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.


Looking forward for your response.
