Hi Andre,

During our discussion regarding this ticket, we highlighted the challenges in downloading all the backup files at once.

[cid:image001.png@01DBA8AE.09A9F230]

Based on your suggestion, if we increase the backup frequency to monthly, then there will be more files than this. Downloading each file manually is tedious and time-consuming.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

In our last remote session we discussed that In effort to reduce the repetitive logs (300 million) under file tracing we recommended to you to exclude .uasset file extensions from file tracing, you will also decide on other file extensions to exclude from file tracing after internal discussions with your team.  Please let us know after you have decided which other file extensions to exclude from file tracing.  After we have received an update from you, we will assist you if required on how to configure audit log backups.  To reduce the size of your live database ""/var/eppfiles/mysql"" you will need to run the audit log backup making sure you uncheck ""Keep backed up logs"" and ""Keep backed up shadows"".

Hi Andre,

These trace files are part of one of our core products and currently, there is a new release being rolled out. Hence, we cannot do anything about that until this week.

For sure, I will get back on this on or before the end of next week.

Until that requesting your patience.

However, the follow-up call to check the disk space can still happen to check.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I wanted to follow up on this case, have you had time to check the uasset file yet and decide if they will be necessary to trace?  Could you please provide us with a status update and let us know if you refined the File Tracing by excluding these file types?

Hi Jafar, Naveen

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.

In our remote session we confirmed that currently the disk space looks good but the problem seems to be on the high number of file tracing 382 millions of logs for a retention period of only 1 week - which is huge! Please see below the screenshots taken in our remote session today.

[cid:image008.png@01DBA8AE.09A9F230]


[cid:image009.png@01DBA8AE.09A9F230]

We agreed that the uasset file logs will be analyzed by Naveen in the hope of a fine tuning the file tracing.  We also agreed to meet again in 1 week from now to see the numbers in terms of disk space and logs count.
We might need to delete all the logs from the appliance in order to clear the huge amount of repetitive logs for same file type after Naveen's analysis in order to retrieve the good functioning of the appliance and be able to store logs for a higher period of time.

This case is now placed on ""Postponed reply"" and deferred until 15th January


Kind regards

Dear Naveen,

Thank you for the update.

I encountered a similar issue and, as part of my testing in my lab for (Adjust the File Tracing settings to capture only the necessary information).

@alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com> @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com> @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com<mailto:stefania.oltean@netwrix.com> @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:natalia.ticu@netwrix.com>

Could you please provide suggestions on the points highlighted by Naveen regarding (configuring an Audit Log backup to reduce the number of logs) and (Adjust the File Tracing settings to capture only the necessary information) The concern is that backup data is deleted from the server, which does not meet the requirement. I recommend scheduling a call to troubleshoot this issue further.

@Naveen Kumar<mailto:naveen.kumar@avrioc.com>

Could you please share your time slots to have a session with the Netwrix team.

Dear @Mohammed Jafar<mailto:jafar@gulfitd.com>,

We recommend the customer to:
Configure an Audit Log backup to reduce the number of logs -  We have scheduled a fortnightly backup for the “Audit Log Backup” and ”Audit Content Aware Log Backup” to take backup of logs that are “Older than 1 week” without leaving the backup data on the server (Backup data are deleted from the server). Since it is not possible to bring back the backup data to the server, reducing this frequency to less than the current schedule will never suit our business requirements.

At least if I want to schedule different backups (separate frequency) for the “Audit Log Backup” and ”Audit Content Aware Log Backup”, I believe it is impossible to achieve it and the same has been confirmed by the support team. Refer to the image below that shows our current schedule.

[cid:image010.png@01DBA8AE.09A9F230]

Adjust the File Tracing settings to capture only the necessary information – How can be adjust the file tracing, I don’t see an option to adjust, I can only either enable or disable it. File shadowing is not enabled for now. Refer to the image below for better understanding.

[cid:image011.png@01DBA8AE.09A9F230]

For both points, please let us know how exactly we can adjust/change the configurations to achieve our business requirements and advise me if I misunderstood something here in configuring.

Thanks!

Hello Jafar,

I trust you are well and Happy New Year to you.

My colleague Andrei Pop is currently out of office so I will take care of this case during his absence.  We have received feedback from our R&D department, please see below the feedback on this case.

Based on the information provided, there doesn't appear to be an issue with disk space.  However, the large volume of logs in the database is causing the System Information page to hang, as it calculates the number of logs in real-time—a resource-intensive operation for the server.

We recommend the customer to:

- Configure an Audit Log backup to reduce the number of logs.
- Adjust the File Tracing settings to capture only the necessary information.


Can I ask that you please implement the suggested actions above and let me know if there is any improvement?


Kind regards

Hello,

Since you are able to log in to the server and navigate it the server is working with the features you selected.
The issue here is the server information page, which takes time to open because one of the tables has around 394 mil logs.
The recommendations I mentioned are to see if we can duce that number.

Kind regards

Dear @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com>, @Natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:Natalia.Ticu@netwrix.com>, @Stefania-Ioana Oltean<mailto:Stefania.Oltean@netwrix.com>,
Enabling all built-in features causes the server to be unable to process requests, this raises a significant concern. It is crucial that the server is optimized to handle such scenarios seamlessly, especially if it becomes unresponsive due to parsing the entire file tracing table.

We strongly recommend reviewing the server's capacity and configuration to ensure it can handle these requests efficiently. Additionally, as this is a SaaS-hosted platform, we expect consistent and reliable performance without such limitations.

Kindly look into this matter promptly and share updates or corrective actions planned to address the performance concerns.

Dear Team,

That means if we are enabling all the built in features the server will not be able to process the same?

If the server is stuck because a command is running to parse the entire filetracing table, please make sure the server is capable to handle the request.

@Alexandra-Diana Bolfa<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com> @Aakif Khan<mailto:aakif@gulfitd.com> @Mohammad Jafar<mailto:jafar@gulfitd.com> this is not the response we are expecting from a SaaS hosted platform.

Hello,

The server is stuck because a command is running to parse the entire filetracing table. Due to it's size the command needs a lot of time to finish. Moving anywhere else on the UI will block it for s few minutes for the command to stop/finish.

My recommendation is to check what file tracing file types or location is noted frequently and confirm if any file type or location can be ignored to reduce the number of file tracing logs are generated.

There is also the recommendations regarding running the audit more often or setting up a SIEM to forward the logs to a SIEM server

Kind regards

Dear Alin,

We need to keep the logs as of now in EPP and at the same time the server information should be visible.

If its due to more logs and then we really suspect the system is not capable to handle that Load.

Please do needful on this.
