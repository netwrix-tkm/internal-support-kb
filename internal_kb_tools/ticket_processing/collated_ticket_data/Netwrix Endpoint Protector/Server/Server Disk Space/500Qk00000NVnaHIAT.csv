Please help me to clean up the space on my server.

<a href='https://b8sond5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/' target='_blank'>https://b8sond5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/</a>","","We've connected remote with Saikat and explained his two options.
Either he needs to set up the system back up with logs older than 1 month to run as currently he had older than 4 months(which had nothing) or he could try to increase the disk space size(for that he needs to contact his account manager to discuss because he's hosting the appliance on our AWS).

Currently we adjusted the system back up V2 to take logs older than 1 month as well as the scheduled back up.

Agreed to keep the ticket opened and let us know tomorrow if the space is cleared.","Will send a follow up note.","Issue solved after clearing space from the backend.","","Marian Ilies","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","6.9","Closed - Resolved","Genius consultants limited","Saikat Banerjee","2025-03-31T10:02:12.000Z","2025-04-07T08:48:59.000Z"
