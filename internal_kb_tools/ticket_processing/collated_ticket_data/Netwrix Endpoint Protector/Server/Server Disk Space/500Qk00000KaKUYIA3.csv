Customer is: Seluz Kimya
Server ID:WNLBBWVW

When the agent is removed, the process is incomplete. We cannot install or uninstall it again. It asks for a password and does not accept it. How can we uninstall this agent? We cannot uninstall it through the interface.

We also get a warning that the server disk is full. What should we do about this?

Screenshots are attached. We are waiting for your help.

Best regards.","","They want to uninstall 1 endpoint and free the disk usage of the EPP server","to close the case","Fixed in the remote session","","Daniel Anton","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","44.3","Closed - Resolved","E-Data Teknoloji Pazarlama","Yunus ICIN","2025-01-14T08:44:01.000Z","2025-02-27T15:24:07.000Z"
