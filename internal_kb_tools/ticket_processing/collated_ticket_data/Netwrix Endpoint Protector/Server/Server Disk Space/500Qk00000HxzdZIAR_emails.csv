We have raised this ticket in order to address the error and disk space issue described in your email.

I have requested SSH access from our devops team in order to access the backend of your EPP server.

As soon as I receive the access I will investigate the issue and get back to you.

We have checked and it seems that the disk got full because of logs and File Shadows(123 GB). File shadows are copies of the files uploaded/copied that are saved on the EPP server.

Please let me know if I can delete the File Shadows and reboot the EPP server.

In order to prevent this in the future what we recommend is:
- creating Audit Log Backups to save the logs from the EPP server in an archived format and clear space
- only setting File Shadows at a Computer or Group level instead of all the computers

Thank you!

We have done the following:

	Deleted the file shadows – now you should have sufficient space
	Rebooted the EPP server


Please let me know if after the EPP server restarts you have access to the EPP server.

Happy to hear that the issue was resolved.

In order to prevent this in the future what we recommend is:
- creating Audit Log Backups to save the logs from the EPP server in an archived format and clear space
- only set File Shadows at a Computer or Group level instead of all the computers, only for the computers that need this functionality enabled.

What File Shadowing does: it creates copies of each uploaded/copied file(for the monitored computers) and stores it on the EPP server. This is the reason why over 120+ GB of space was occuppied.

Please let me know if we can close this ticket.

I went on ahead and turned off File Shadowing. But we have this error message again and now I can't do a back-up.

Hi Nathan,

Happy to hear that the issue was resolved.

In order to prevent this in the future what we recommend is:
- creating Audit Log Backups to save the logs from the EPP server in an archived format and clear space
- only set File Shadows at a Computer or Group level instead of all the computers, only for the computers that need this functionality enabled.

What File Shadowing does: it creates copies of each uploaded/copied file(for the monitored computers) and stores it on the EPP server. This is the reason why over 120+ GB of space was occuppied.

Please let me know if we can close this ticket.

We have taken a look and cleared some additional space on the EPP server.You should have over 50% free space now on the disk. You should be able to run the Audit Log Backups now. Please allow about 10 minutes for changes to replicate in the UI.

Before we cleared space:


After:


What we deleted: 31 GB of file shadows and backups and patches that were no longer needed.

Please let us know if in about 10-20 minutes you are able to run the Audit Log backup again.
