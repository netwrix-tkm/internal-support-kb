- The inability to access the server terminal prevents the customer from performing necessary maintenance tasks.
- A remote session with support is required to address disk space issues when local access is unavailable.
- Deleting file shadows older than a certain threshold (e.g., 14 days) can significantly reduce disk usage and restore server functionality.
- There may be related issues regarding external storage that require separate follow-up.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-06-03T08:45:50.000Z"

2. If disk space issues persist or terminal access problems continue, customer should open a new support ticket.
3. Customer to follow up on the separate ticket regarding external storage with the assigned support engineer.
4. Support to provide documentation or automation options for regular disk cleanup if requested by the customer.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-06-03T08:45:57.000Z"
