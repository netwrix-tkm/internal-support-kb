@WaitingOnEngineer 
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf was incorrectly configured as such:


access_log off;
error_log off;


Should be:


access_log off;
error_log /dev/null;


OR



access_log off;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log crit;


This setting has never changed. 


The monitoring and escalation flow from the automated AWS DevOps monitoring to technical support ticketing is not working. This is being discussed between Paul and Bogdan.

@Mihai Rosca would the JPMC administrators have received low disk warnings via the Unify UI feature? Is this a banner notification in the UI, or an alert email? Does this feature work?

@Jonathan Micheal Orford There is a setting in System Status->HDD Disk Space and Log Rotation. Only if this setting enabled old logs will be automatically overwritten by the new ones when the Server’s disk space reaches a certain percentage (starting from 50% up to 90%, it's customizable).

Is this setting set on on the customer's environment?

Now, going further, a system alert can be set up for admins to be notified when e chosen disk space threshold has been reached. Alerts are being sent by email, they need the e-mail settings to be configured correctly.


To my current knowledge, the feature should work. Currently checking to see if there are any outstanding unknown issues in that area that we should be aware of.
