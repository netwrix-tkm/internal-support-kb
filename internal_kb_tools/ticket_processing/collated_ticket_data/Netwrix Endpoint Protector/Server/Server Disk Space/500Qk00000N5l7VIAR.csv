"500Qk00000N5l7VIAR","00439270","Support Ticket","Appliance is running on low disk space","We are having space issue which may affect the functionality of EPP server, Kindly let know how we can free space.","","Connected remote along with Adrian to assist Vignesh.
We logged into SSH to remove old backup files from /var/eppfiles/logbackup and /var/log/backups to remove backups older than 6 months. This allowed the client to clear more than 50% of their storage. Also, even though they had 89GB of shadows, due to the Audit Log Backup, they shadows will be removed as well freeing up more space.","Will send a follow up note and will wait for their confirmation.","Dispace cleared and turned off the shadowing option.

Client reported that the issue has been fixed after clearing up the disk space.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","NONE","","20.1","Closed - Resolved","Sodexo","Vignesh Haldankar","2025-03-19T08:46:27.000Z","2025-04-08T10:09:54.000Z"
