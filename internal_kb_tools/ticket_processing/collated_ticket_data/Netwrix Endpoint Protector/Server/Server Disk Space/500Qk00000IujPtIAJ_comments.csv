Hi Alin,

As Catalin is currently on PTO and he has the required knowledge I would propose that we postpone this until he is back from it. He will be back starting with the 30th of December 2024.

Thank you,

Bogdan

They had /dev/sda (1 TB) and /dev/sdb (1 TB) as disks, the second one being empty and the first containing EPPServer. They wanted to extend /var/eppfiles, which resided on /dev/sda5 so as to use, in addition, the 1 TB space on /dev/sdb

A new lvm group was created, and /dev/sdb1 was configured as lvm volume inside this group. The lvm volume was formatted as ext4 and the content of old /var/eppfiles (of course, after services were stopped) was rsync'ed to this new /dev/sdb1 derived volume.

Afterwards /dev/sda5 was configured as lvm volume and added to the already existing lvm group. Lvm volume configured from /dev/sdb1 was extended and also its filesystem was resized to fit ~2TB.  Now the ~2TB lvm volume is ~2TB.
