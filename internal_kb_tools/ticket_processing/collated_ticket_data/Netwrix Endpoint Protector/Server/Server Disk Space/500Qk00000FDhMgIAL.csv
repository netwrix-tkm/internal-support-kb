"500Qk00000FDhMgIAL","00419726","Support Ticket","[BDO] Appliance is running low on disk space","Hi Support, 

Customer is getting a notification for low system storage. I request you to please take remote session to take SSH, and check the partitions on Disk. Please suggest 2-3 time slots according to Malaysia Time. 
Also, the customer's server is Hosted By CoSoSys (SaaS model). I suppose, you can take remote from your side too and share us the summary of the steps performed at the backend. Below is the customer detail. 

Customer name: BDO Malaysia 
Server ID: R1T3W7I9

Refer to the attached screenshot - EPP Low Disk <a href='https://Space.png' target='_blank'>Space.png</a>

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","fixed","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","38.0","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2024-09-02T07:07:58.000Z","2024-10-10T07:56:58.000Z"
