Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.


Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.




The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Thank you for letting me know.
Since the EPP Server is hosted on our side, I can investigate this issue from my location, without having to remotely connect.

I will let you know as soon as I clear the alerts from the queue.

Emil

You host EPP for us, not sure what you're using.

 

I'm available this afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Hello Jamie,

We should schedule a remote session in order to clear the alterts from the queue.
Please let me know if your EPP Server is hosted on prem or if it is hosted on cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Thank you,
Emil

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

 

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is  5.9.3.0.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the  5.9.3.0 server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.


Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.




The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

Thank you for letting me know.
Since the EPP Server is hosted on our side, I can investigate this issue from my location, without having to remotely connect.

I will let you know as soon as I clear the alerts from the queue.

Best regards,
Emil

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

 

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is  5.9.3.0.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the  5.9.3.0 server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.


Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.




The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Best regards,
Emil

Server is not working.  I cannot log in.   I've been waiting about 5 minutes and I'm still stuck on the login screen after clicking ""LOGIN"".

Please advise and escalate as this is a critical component of our DLP program.

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0>.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0> server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Am I on the latest version?

Also, I noticed that I have not received an alert since 5/16/2024.  Can you look into this for me, please?

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.
[Image_2024-06-06_21-56-16.png]

Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.

[Image_2024-06-06_22-13-18.png]


The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Best regards,

Emil - 

 

Server is not working.  I cannot log in.   I've been waiting about 5 minutes and I'm still stuck on the login screen after clicking ""LOGIN"".

 

Please advise and escalate as this is a critical component of our DLP program.

Thanks - I've configured the settings below and will advise if I need further assistance.

Our version is Premium 5.8.1.0<http://5.8.1.0>

Am I on the latest version?

Also, I noticed that I have not received an alert since 5/16/2024.  Can you look into this for me, please?

Thanks,
Jamie

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.
[Image_2024-06-06_21-56-16.png]

Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.

[Image_2024-06-06_22-13-18.png]


The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

I would suggest to update all the existing machines from the EPP UI by accessing System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade -> Select the latest EPP Client version for Windows -> Next -> Select all the computers -> Next. (You will have to create another upgrade job for the Mac machines.)
This is going to update all the EPP Clients to the latest version once they will receive the update command from the EPP Server.

For the new machines you can download the EPP Client from System Configuration -> Client Software.

If the update fails for some of the machines, I will suggest to manually uninstall the old EPP Client and then to install the new EPP Client.

Please note that for the windows machines you will not be able to install the newer version of the EPP Client on top of the old one. So you will have to uninstall the old EPP Client first and then to install the new EPP Client.
For the mac machines, you can install the new version of the EPP Client on top of the old EPP Client version.

Best regards,
Emil

Last item on my to-do list is to update the clients, which some are still on 5.7.7.7 - how do I do that and how do I download the installer so I can push it out for new computer builds?

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

 

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is  5.9.3.0.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the  5.9.3.0 server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

We should schedule a remote session in order to clear the alterts from the queue.
Please let me know if your EPP Server is hosted on prem or if it is hosted on cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Thank you,
Emil

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0>.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0> server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.
[Image_2024-06-06_21-56-16.png]

Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.

[Image_2024-06-06_22-13-18.png]


The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

What happens if the client is installed on top of the old one - will the installer fail?

Hello Jamie,

I would suggest to update all the existing machines from the EPP UI by accessing System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade -> Select the latest EPP Client version for Windows -> Next -> Select all the computers -> Next. (You will have to create another upgrade job for the Mac machines.)
This is going to update all the EPP Clients to the latest version once they will receive the update command from the EPP Server.

For the new machines you can download the EPP Client from System Configuration -> Client Software.

If the update fails for some of the machines, I will suggest to manually uninstall the old EPP Client and then to install the new EPP Client.

Please note that for the windows machines you will not be able to install the newer version of the EPP Client on top of the old one. So you will have to uninstall the old EPP Client first and then to install the new EPP Client.
For the mac machines, you can install the new version of the EPP Client on top of the old EPP Client version.

Best regards,
Emil

Much better!

 

Last item on my to-do list is to update the clients, which some are still on  5.7.7.7 - how do I do that and how do I download the installer so I can push it out for new computer builds?

 

Thanks for all of your help!

Emil - 

 

Server is not working.  I cannot log in.   I've been waiting about 5 minutes and I'm still stuck on the login screen after clicking ""LOGIN"".

 

Please advise and escalate as this is a critical component of our DLP program.

I would suggest to update all the existing machines from the EPP UI by accessing System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade -> Select the latest EPP Client version for Windows -> Next -> Select all the computers -> Next. (You will have to create another upgrade job for the Mac machines.)

Emil -

Server is not working.  I cannot log in.   I've been waiting about 5 minutes and I'm still stuck on the login screen after clicking ""LOGIN"".

Please advise and escalate as this is a critical component of our DLP program.

Thanks,
Jamie

Emil - I'm also not receiving any email notifications from the server.  This happened once before - many emails were ""stuck"" in a queue somewhere and a technician had to clear it out for us.

I'm still having issues with space.  Can you help look at that as well?

Hello Jamie,

The latest EPP Server version is 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0>.
You can update the EPP Server from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Check now -> tick the tickbox on the left side of the patch name -> Apply update -> wait until the update process is complete -> Refresh the UI -> Check the server version on the bottom right corner again.

You will have to apply multiple updates until you will reach to the 5.9.3.0<http://5.9.3.0> server version.

Let me know if you will face any issues while updating the EPP Server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.
[Image_2024-06-06_21-56-16.png]

Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start.
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.

[Image_2024-06-06_22-13-18.png]


The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Hello Jamie,

For the windows machines, when you try to install the new EPP Client on top of the old EPP Client, the install will fail and it will give you a message like ""The product is already installed"".
For the mac machines, when you install the new EPP Client on top of the old EPP Client it will update it to the latest version.

Best regards,
Emil

Thank you for the detailed information.

 

What happens if the client is installed on top of the old one - will the installer fail?

Hello Jamie,

I would suggest to update all the existing machines from the EPP UI by accessing System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade -> Select the latest EPP Client version for Windows -> Next -> Select all the computers -> Next. (You will have to create another upgrade job for the Mac machines.)
This is going to update all the EPP Clients to the latest version once they will receive the update command from the EPP Server.

For the new machines you can download the EPP Client from System Configuration -> Client Software.

If the update fails for some of the machines, I will suggest to manually uninstall the old EPP Client and then to install the new EPP Client.

Please note that for the windows machines you will not be able to install the newer version of the EPP Client on top of the old one. So you will have to uninstall the old EPP Client first and then to install the new EPP Client.
For the mac machines, you can install the new version of the EPP Client on top of the old EPP Client version.

Best regards,
Emil

Much better!

 

Last item on my to-do list is to update the clients, which some are still on  5.7.7.7 - how do I do that and how do I download the installer so I can push it out for new computer builds?

 

Thanks for all of your help!

Thanks - I've configured the settings below and will advise if I need further assistance.

 

Our version is Premium  5.8.1.0

 

Am I on the latest version?  

 

Also, I noticed that I have not received an alert since 5/16/2024.  Can you look into this for me, please?

 

Thanks,

Jamie

Hello Jamie,

Regarding the log clean up, you can access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a one time backup which will clean up all the logs older than 6 months.
Once the backup is complete you can download the report from the Backup List, found at the bottom of the Audit Log Backup page.


Also, the backup can be scheduled to run automatically.
Access System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup -> Scroll down to ""Schedule Backup""
Select the log type that you want to include in the backup -> Choose the frequency for the bakcup -> Choose what logs to backup -> Start. 
The example below will create a scheduler backup which will run every month and clean up all the logs older than 6 months.




The current EPP Server version will be shown in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.
And the current EPP Client versions installed on the computers can be found accessing Device Control -> Computers.

Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.

Best regards,
Emil
