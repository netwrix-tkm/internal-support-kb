we’re really concerned about the storage allocated to our Netwrix DLP tenant. Right now, during the implementation phase and while testing a few policies, we’ve noticed that over 75% of our storage is already consumed.
 
This won’t be sufficient once we go live at full capacity. If this continues, we might have to start clearing logs every week, which isn’t ideal.

Please find the warning email below.

Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 43.03 gb free available from 237.54 gb (18%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.","","Due to repetitive logs (300 million) under file tracing .uasset file extensions the customer database have grown very big in size +120 SQL database. We recommended to customer to exclude .uasset file extensions from file tracing to reduce the number of entries of event logs under file tracing.","In our last remote session we discussed that In effort to reduce the repetitive logs (300 million) under file tracing we recommended to customer to exclude .uasset file extensions from file tracing, customer will also decide on other file extensions to exclude from file tracing after internal discussions with their team.  Customer will let us know after they have decided which other file extensions to exclude from file tracing.  After we have received an update from customer, we will assist them if required on how to configure audit log backups.  To reduce the size of their live database ""/var/eppfiles/mysql"" they will need to run the audit log backup making sure to uncheck ""Keep backed up logs"" and ""Keep backed up shadows"".","We advised the customer to refine their file tracing by excluding file extensions that are repetitive creating millions of event logs.
