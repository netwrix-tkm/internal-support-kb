Regarding Ticket Number: 00425889, I am opening this ticket in reference to the previous one. The customer's disk space was full, and it was increased via remote access provided by your team. However, the customer is still experiencing the same issue. Could you please provide remote access and check the situation on November 21 or 22? 

Thank you.","","","","Space cleared,
