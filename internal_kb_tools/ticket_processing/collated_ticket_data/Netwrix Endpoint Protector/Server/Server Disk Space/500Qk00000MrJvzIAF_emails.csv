Hi,

Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am - 5pm SAST.)

I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.

Regards

Shaun

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

Hi,  

 

Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)

 

I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.

 

Regards

 

Shaun

Hi,



Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)



I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.



Regards



Shaun

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

We apologies for making it appear that we won't support you during your local working hours.  Your case have been reassigned and I will be assisting you during your local business hours as we are both located in the same time zone, South Africa.
On Monday I have slots open at 12:30 PM SAST, 1:30 PM SAST and then from 2:30 PM SAST until 4 PM SAST.  On Tuesday and Wednesday my calendar is mostly open between 8 AM and 4 PM SAST.

Please let me know when you would like to have our remote session,  I will then schedule the meeting and send you the meeting invitation.


Kind regards

Hi Shaun,

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

My colleagues will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi,



Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)



I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.



Regards



Shaun

Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  I have freed up some disk space on your EPP Server by clearing some of  the Ubuntu system logs that have accumulated over time.  Can you log into your EPP Server's UI and check to see if you still have the low disk space message showing and let me know please?

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

We apologies for making it appear that we won't support you during your local working hours.  Your case have been reassigned and I will be assisting you during your local business hours as we are both located in the same time zone, South Africa.
On Monday I have slots open at 12:30 PM SAST, 1:30 PM SAST and then from 2:30 PM SAST until 4 PM SAST.  On Tuesday and Wednesday my calendar is mostly open between 8 AM and 4 PM SAST.

Please let me know when you would like to have our remote session,  I will then schedule the meeting and send you the meeting invitation.


Kind regards

Hi Shaun,

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

My colleagues will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi,  

 

Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)

 

I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.

 

Regards

 

Shaun

Hi Shaun,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  I have freed up some disk space on your EPP Server by clearing some of  the Ubuntu system logs that have accumulated over time.  Can you log into your EPP Server's UI and check to see if you still have the low disk space message showing and let me know please?

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

We apologies for making it appear that we won't support you during your local working hours.  Your case have been reassigned and I will be assisting you during your local business hours as we are both located in the same time zone, South Africa.
On Monday I have slots open at 12:30 PM SAST, 1:30 PM SAST and then from 2:30 PM SAST until 4 PM SAST.  On Tuesday and Wednesday my calendar is mostly open between 8 AM and 4 PM SAST.

Please let me know when you would like to have our remote session,  I will then schedule the meeting and send you the meeting invitation.


Kind regards

Hi Shaun,

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

My colleagues will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi,  

 

Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)

 

I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.

 

Regards

 

Shaun

Hi Andre

Sorry.  A bit hectic here.

Yes the low storage message has gone.

I have not really worked in the UI to check performance though but I assume it has improved

Thanks

You may close the call

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

I would like to follow up on this case since we had our remote session as we have not yet received feedback from you.  Could you kindly conform if the low disk space message is gone and also if performance improved after the EPP Server reboot as suggested in our call?

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

We apologies for making it appear that we won't support you during your local working hours.  Your case have been reassigned and I will be assisting you during your local business hours as we are both located in the same time zone, South Africa.
On Monday I have slots open at 12:30 PM SAST, 1:30 PM SAST and then from 2:30 PM SAST until 4 PM SAST.  On Tuesday and Wednesday my calendar is mostly open between 8 AM and 4 PM SAST.

Please let me know when you would like to have our remote session,  I will then schedule the meeting and send you the meeting invitation.


Kind regards

Hi Shaun,

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

My colleagues will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi,



Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)



I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.



Regards



Shaun

Hi Andre

 

Sorry.  A bit hectic here. 

 

Yes the low storage message has gone.  

 

I have not really worked in the UI to check performance though but I assume it has improved 

 

Thanks

 

You may close the call

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

I would like to follow up on this case since we had our remote session as we have not yet received feedback from you.  Could you kindly conform if the low disk space message is gone and also if performance improved after the EPP Server reboot as suggested in our call?

Hi Shaun,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  I have freed up some disk space on your EPP Server by clearing some of  the Ubuntu system logs that have accumulated over time.  Can you log into your EPP Server's UI and check to see if you still have the low disk space message showing and let me know please?

Hello Shaun,

I hope all is well.

We apologies for making it appear that we won't support you during your local working hours.  Your case have been reassigned and I will be assisting you during your local business hours as we are both located in the same time zone, South Africa.
On Monday I have slots open at 12:30 PM SAST, 1:30 PM SAST and then from 2:30 PM SAST until 4 PM SAST.  On Tuesday and Wednesday my calendar is mostly open between 8 AM and 4 PM SAST.

Please let me know when you would like to have our remote session,  I will then schedule the meeting and send you the meeting invitation.


Kind regards

Hi Shaun,

Apologies for the misunderstanding, I was not aware of your working hours. I am part of the US time zone shift.

I will ask my colleagues that cover your time zone to get back to you and schedule a remote session at a more convenient time for you.

My colleagues will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi,  

 

Sorry I am not able to do Tuesday.  I was under the impression that Netwrix had a 24/7 helpdesk assistance yet I am being requested to work after hours to get assistance.  This is really NOT what I expected from this company especially since, when the product was originally  in COSOSYS we got assistance during our standard work hours (8am – 5pm SAST.)

 

I can do Wednesday at the very latest.  If you cant do Wednesday then please hand over to another engineer.

 

Regards

 

Shaun
