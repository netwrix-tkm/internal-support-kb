Thank you for getting back to us with the requested details.

From what we can see you are getting a ''fsck exited with status code 4'' error.

To sort this out, please take first a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

After you take the snapshot, please run the below command:

e2fsck -f /dev/sda4

Then after the command completes, check again if you can boot up the EPP server.

Looking forward to your response.
