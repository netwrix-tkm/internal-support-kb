In our remote session we have deleted:
* File shadows older than 60 days as requested.

*The folder ""backup"" these are automatic backups (these backups are automatically created in the backend which can be used in emergency situations to restore a recent backup of the SQL databases). The older backups are rarely required.  We usually clean this folder up by deleting the older backups, but leaving the last three backups which are sufficient in case we need to do an emergency restore of your database.

After deleting the above customer have gained 31% of disk space, with 60% of their EPP Server's disk space utilized.

We have also scheduled audit log backups to run every 2 weeks and deleting file shadows and logs older than 2 months","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-21T15:12:30.000Z"
