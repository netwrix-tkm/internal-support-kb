Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- cleared the System Disk space from 38GB to 34GB by vacuuming the journal (4.1GB)
- cleared artifacts and cache and this took us from 34GB to 11GB occupied
- checked other settings that may have caused this.

Because you mentioned that this was fixed before and the issue came back, I will put this ticket on hold for about 2 weeks and check back with you after that to see if the issue with such large disk space being occupied by these files in such a small time frame happens again.

If it does we will investigate with our devops team to see if we can either extend the System Disk partition or set limits on how much space can be occupied by cache and journal files.
