"500Qk00000PtALRIA3","00446869","Support Ticket","Server disk space is 1% please help us to resolve this issue","Epp server disk space is full kindly help us to remove the older than 1 month data.

We are not able to access server terminal","","- The server's disk space can become critically low if old data, such as file shadows, is not regularly deleted.
- The inability to access the server terminal prevents the customer from performing necessary maintenance tasks.
- A remote session with support is required to address disk space issues when local access is unavailable.
- Deleting file shadows older than a certain threshold (e.g., 14 days) can significantly reduce disk usage and restore server functionality.
- There may be related issues regarding external storage that require separate follow-up.","1. Customer to monitor disk usage and schedule regular cleanup of old file shadows to prevent recurrence.
2. If disk space issues persist or terminal access problems continue, customer should open a new support ticket.
3. Customer to follow up on the separate ticket regarding external storage with the assigned support engineer.
4. Support to provide documentation or automation options for regular disk cleanup if requested by the customer.","During a remote support session, the support engineer deleted file shadows older than 14 days from the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server. This action successfully reduced disk usage, increasing available space from 1% to 21%. The immediate issue of critically low disk space was resolved, and the server returned to normal operation. The customer was advised to continue further actions regarding external storage in a separate support ticket with another engineer. No further action was required on this ticket.","Best Practices Question","Alin Anca","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","Samsung - SRI Bangalore","Christeen Das Fernandez","2025-06-03T05:25:04.000Z","2025-06-03T08:47:21.000Z"
