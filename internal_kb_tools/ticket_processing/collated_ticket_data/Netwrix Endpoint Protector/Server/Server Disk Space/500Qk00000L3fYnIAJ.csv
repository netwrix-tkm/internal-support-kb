"500Qk00000L3fYnIAJ","00433588","Support Ticket","Generated error about the database size.","When I log into the server, I see a generated error message ""Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 6.83 gb free available from 19.52 gb (35%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support."". 
I've removed all the logs from the host and nothing changes. I've changed our audit time frame from monthly to weekly and nothing changes. The interface can be slow to respond and sometimes freezes, particularly when I try and go to Appliance > Server Information. It may take 60 seconds to populate, sometimes longer.","","","","Closing ticket as resolved per last customer comment.","","Zachary Roy","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","10.7","Closed - Resolved","OHSU - Oregon Health & Science University","Jacques Perrolle","2025-01-24T23:30:11.000Z","2025-02-04T16:33:02.000Z"
