- rebooted the EPP server - was online for 180+ days
- checked policies
- checked resources - we recommend increasing the CPU core count from 2 to 4 and the GB of RAM from 4 to 8 in order to have a better performance
- spoke about Audit Log Backup - removes logs older than x days/months from the EPP server and archives them so you can locally download them. You can choose to keep the most recent 1-2 months of logs(what value you think is relevant here for you business) on the EPP server and archive the rest/older ones.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","6.9","Closed - Resolved","Timberland Bank","JJ Johnson","2025-03-03T22:40:16.000Z","2025-03-10T20:46:23.000Z"
