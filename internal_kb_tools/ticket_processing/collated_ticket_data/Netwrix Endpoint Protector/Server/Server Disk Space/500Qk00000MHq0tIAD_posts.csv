Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 6.56 gb free available from 19.52 gb (34%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.

I have run the audit log backup 4 times on ""Logs older than 1 year"" and that error message isn't clearing or the amount of consumed space getting smaller.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-25T16:40:17.000Z"
