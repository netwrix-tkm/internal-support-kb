A few days ago we started to update the tenant (v5.7.1), but we were facing an issue when we tried to update to v5.9, we get the following warning:

Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 82.27 gb free available from 267.07 gb (31%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.

Could you guide us to know what will the best path to backup or freed space from disk? We do not want to lose the historic events and we need to continue with the update.

Thank you in advanced.","","","","Solved during remote session","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","27.5","Closed - Resolved","Shield Force","Jose Luis Vera Garcia","2024-08-31T06:46:33.000Z","2024-09-27T18:44:25.000Z"
