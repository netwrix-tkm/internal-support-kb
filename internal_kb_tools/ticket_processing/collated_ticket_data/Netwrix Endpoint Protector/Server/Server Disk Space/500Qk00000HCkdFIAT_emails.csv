Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

Anything I'm at your service.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this.
The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Hello Emil, 

 

Thank you for your response, Jarek is away for a few days but has asked me to continue with this topic.

 

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

 



 

Thanks.

Hi Ivan,

We are still waiting for our R&D Team to let us know the next step here.

Emil is out of office until Monday, but I just followed up internally on this and will keep you posted on any update we get.

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

 

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil,

Thank you for your response, Jarek is away for a few days but has asked me to continue with this topic.

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Thanks.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this.
The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.

Hello Emil, 

 

Thank you for your response, Jarek is away for a few days but has asked me to continue with this topic.

 

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

We are still waiting for our R&D Team to let us know the next step here.

Emil is out of office until Monday, but I just followed up internally on this and will keep you posted on any update we get.

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

 

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this.
The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.

Best regards,
Emil

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it). 
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this.
The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it).
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:


Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it). 
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it).
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

Anything I'm at your service.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:


Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it). 
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

We have a different user that has to be used in order to SSH on the server.
Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow in order to investigate this again.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil, 

 

Thank you for your response, Jarek is away for a few days but has asked me to continue with this topic.

 

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

 



 

Thanks.

Hi Ivan,

We are still waiting for our R&D Team to let us know the next step here.

Emil is out of office until Monday, but I just followed up internally on this and will keep you posted on any update we get.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

 

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

 

Anything I'm at your service.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:

EXTERNAL EMAIL: BE VIGILANT

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it).
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it).
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:


Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it). 
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Hi Ivan,

We are still waiting for our R&D Team to let us know the next step here.

Emil is out of office until Monday, but I just followed up internally on this and will keep you posted on any update we get.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

 

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

 

Anything I'm at your service.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:


Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it). 
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Thank you for the file. I attached it to the internal ticket and I am waiting for the engineers to review the logs.
I will get back to you with an update as soon as I will have some news from the engineers.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil, 

 

Thank you for your response, Jarek is away for a few days but has asked me to continue with this topic.

 

About connecting through PuTTY, do I need a specific user for this?

Hi Ivan,

We are still waiting for our R&D Team to let us know the next step here.

Emil is out of office until Monday, but I just followed up internally on this and will keep you posted on any update we get.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Emil, I hope you are well,

 

I don't remember if a meeting is needed again to refine the final details. It seems to me that they were reviewing some things on their side, do you know what the next step is?

 

Anything I'm at your service.

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can have a remote session tomorrow in order to further discuss about this and setup the audit log backup together.

As the backup is set in your screenshot, it will backup and remove all the logs from the server.
I would recommend to backup only some of the logs. For example you can backup the logs older than 6 months instead of backing up all of the logs.

I would do it as in the following screenshot:

EXTERNAL EMAIL: BE VIGILANT

Hello Ivan,

We are still working in order to address this issue in one of the next server updates.

Until the issue will be addressed with a server update, my colleagues recommended to start an Audit Log Backup for the Content Aware Logs so the server will remove some of the old CAP logs.
When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will add some fields to the ""cf_log"" table in the database. After the script will update the table, the files can be manually removed.
The cron script should run automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for intervention in order to start it).
After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.

If you need to keep the logs and you don't want to backup and remove more recent logs, we can remotely connect again and I can remove the fileshadows from the backend.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Ivan,

I will need to use Putty or a Terminal in order to SSH on the EPP Server.
Also, since the server is hosted by you on AWS, you will have to open the port 62828 for your IP in order to be able to SSH on the server.

Thank you,

Hello Ivan,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this.
The shadows can also be removed from the server's backend if we will not be able to remove them from the UI.
