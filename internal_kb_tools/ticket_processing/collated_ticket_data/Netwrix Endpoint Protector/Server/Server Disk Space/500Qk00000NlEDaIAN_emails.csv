Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Can you please confirm the server version you are on? (In the UI in the lower right corner)
If it is lower that 5.9.4.1 please create a VM snapshot then try to update the server from Dashboard > Live Update to see if the error remains.
I will share updates for the offline server based on the current version.

If the issue remains after updating we can look into migrating the server to a vew VM.

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.

Hello Andrei,

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.








Best Regards,

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

/var/eppfiles/quicklogs 
It is far to big.
Please run
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/* | grep G


Before changing the disk size in ssh, please be sure to create a VM snapshot to be able to return in case of issues.

To extend the storage, you need to run a few commands.
1. Stop all required services
service nginx stop
service cron stop
service mysql stop
service php-fpm stop
service rsyslog stop
pkill -f run_workers.php

If rsyslog is not present  try
service syslog-ng stop

2. Unmount the last partition
umount /dev/sda5

3. Edit master boot record
parted /dev/sda
p - this will print the partitions
resizepart 5 100% – this will resize
quit

Run the command:
partprobe

4. Check the partitions for errors:
e2fsck –f /dev/sda5

5. Resize last partition
resize2fs /dev/sda5

6. Check they can be mounted successfully
mount -a
df -h

7. Restart the EPP Appliance:
reboot

8. Check the new size with the commands:
df -h

Kind regards

Hello,

/var/eppfiles/quicklogs
It is far to big.
Please run
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/* | grep G


Before changing the disk size in ssh, please be sure to create a VM snapshot to be able to return in case of issues.

To extend the storage, you need to run a few commands.
1. Stop all required services
service nginx stop
service cron stop
service mysql stop
service php-fpm stop
service rsyslog stop
pkill -f run_workers.php

If rsyslog is not present  try
service syslog-ng stop

2. Unmount the last partition
umount /dev/sda5

3. Edit master boot record
parted /dev/sda
p - this will print the partitions
resizepart 5 100% – this will resize
quit

Run the command:
partprobe

4. Check the partitions for errors:
e2fsck –f /dev/sda5

5. Resize last partition
resize2fs /dev/sda5

6. Check they can be mounted successfully
mount -a
df -h

7. Restart the EPP Appliance:
reboot

8. Check the new size with the commands:
df -h

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

 

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

 

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

 

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0 

 

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

Hello,

/var/eppfiles/quicklogs
It is far to big.
Please run
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/* | grep G


Before changing the disk size in ssh, please be sure to create a VM snapshot to be able to return in case of issues.

To extend the storage, you need to run a few commands.
1. Stop all required services
service nginx stop
service cron stop
service mysql stop
service php-fpm stop
service rsyslog stop
pkill -f run_workers.php

If rsyslog is not present  try
service syslog-ng stop

2. Unmount the last partition
umount /dev/sda5

3. Edit master boot record
parted /dev/sda
p - this will print the partitions
resizepart 5 100% – this will resize
quit

Run the command:
partprobe

4. Check the partitions for errors:
e2fsck –f /dev/sda5

5. Resize last partition
resize2fs /dev/sda5

6. Check they can be mounted successfully
mount -a
df -h

7. Restart the EPP Appliance:
reboot

8. Check the new size with the commands:
df -h

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.








Best Regards,

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards

Hello,

/var/eppfiles/quicklogs 
It is far to big.
Please run
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/* | grep G

Before changing the disk size in ssh, please be sure to create a VM snapshot to be able to return in case of issues.

To extend the storage, you need to run a few commands.
1. Stop all required services
service nginx stop
service cron stop
service mysql stop
service php-fpm stop
service rsyslog stop
pkill -f run_workers.php

If rsyslog is not present  try
service syslog-ng stop

2. Unmount the last partition
umount /dev/sda5

3. Edit master boot record
parted /dev/sda
p - this will print the partitions
resizepart 5 100% – this will resize
quit

Run the command:
partprobe

4. Check the partitions for errors:
e2fsck –f /dev/sda5

5. Resize last partition
resize2fs /dev/sda5

6. Check they can be mounted successfully
mount -a
df -h

7. Restart the EPP Appliance:
reboot

8. Check the new size with the commands:
df -h

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

 

Right now, I can't access the server through GUI.

 

When I raised a ticket with the support team, I can able to access it.

 

The server is running with Version 5.8.1.0 

 

We can't do the live update because isolated environment better shares the offline update along with step-by-step guide.

 

 

 

 

 

 

	Best Regards,

Hello,

Good morning.
Thank you for the information.

Please check the server space on the server from the UI at ""Appliance > Server Information""
If the space is occupied by the logs, you can enable the Audit Log Backup from System Maintenance and set it to delete the backed up logs.
If the space is occupied by the shadows you can remove them from System Maintenance > File Maintenance.
If the two above are not the issue please check in Audit Log Backup or System backup if there are several backups present, you can download them then delete them from the Epp server to free the space.

Kind regards
