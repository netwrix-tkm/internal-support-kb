Customer is: Seluz Kimya
Server ID:WNLBBWVW

When the agent is removed, the process is incomplete. We cannot install or uninstall it again. It asks for a password and does not accept it. How can we uninstall this agent? We cannot uninstall it through the interface.

We also get a warning that the server disk is full. What should we do about this?

Screenshots are attached. We are waiting for your help.

Best regards.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-14T08:44:01.000Z"
