Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.
techsupport     Office 365      agshealth.com
Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.
