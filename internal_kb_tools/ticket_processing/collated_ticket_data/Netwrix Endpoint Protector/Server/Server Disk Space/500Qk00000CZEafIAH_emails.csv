Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

To be able to display the maximum capacity of your disk, in the EPP web interface, we will need to extend the disk from the backend of the server .

Could you please provide us 2 3 timeframes with your availability for tomorrow, or for the next week so we can schedule a remote session, where we will perform the steps required? 

Looking forward for your response.


Best regards,
