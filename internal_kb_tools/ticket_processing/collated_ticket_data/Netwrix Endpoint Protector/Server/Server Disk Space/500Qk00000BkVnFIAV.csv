"500Qk00000BkVnFIAV","00411723","Support Ticket","Disk Space Issue","Hi,

We currently have an EPP server deployment VM running, and we have been receiving the following notification:

""Your appliance is running low on disk space. There is 87.7 GB free out of 257.28 GB (34%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce the incoming log count. For further assistance, contact Support.""

We have cleared all audit logs and database backups, but it hasn't made a difference. We cannot determine what else might be consuming space on the server. We increased the hard disk size to 500 GB, but this change is not reflected on the server. Even with SSH enabled, we are unable to SSH into the server to try increasing the disk size from the command line.

For further assistance, please advise on the next steps we should take.

Thank you.","","","","We expanded the main disk partition and made a change in the backend so that the log pertaining to events forwarded to your SIEM, gets archived.","","Alin Decean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Feral Interactive","feral feral","2024-06-12T13:23:22.000Z","2024-06-25T12:45:04.000Z"
