• What is the impact of the issue on your business? If the management server runs out of space it will become unusable.
• Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried? I have deleted a backup file to gain about 1.5GB back. The shadow files I'm unable to delete. The system crashes. I have had this issue for a long time. A support person generally gets on a zoom meeting with me, logs into the management console with elevated rights, and deletes the shadow files manually.
• What are you trying to do or accomplish? Redundant question
