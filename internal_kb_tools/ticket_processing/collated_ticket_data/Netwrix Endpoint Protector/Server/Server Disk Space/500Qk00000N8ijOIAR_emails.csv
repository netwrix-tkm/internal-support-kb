I checked the server and found the following:
The folder ""backup"", these are automatic backups (these backups are automatically created in the backend which can be used in emergency situations to restore a recent backup of the SQL databases) take up a lot of space. The older backups are rarely or never required. Please let me know how these backups are set up to run.

The folder ""mysql"", this folder contains your live database. To reduce this size we recommend that you make use of audit log backups and delete older event logs which may not required or necessary to be present and accessible on the EPP Server's UI. You can archive these older event logs and store them on an external storage location.

Hi Pravin,

I checked the server and found the following:
The folder ""backup"", these are automatic backups (these backups are automatically created in the backend which can be used in emergency situations to restore a recent backup of the SQL databases) take up a lot of space. The older backups are rarely or never required. Please let me know how these backups are set up to run.

The folder ""mysql"", this folder contains your live database. To reduce this size we recommend that you make use of audit log backups and delete older event logs which may not required or necessary to be present and accessible on the EPP Server's UI. You can archive these older event logs and store them on an external storage location.

Hi Botond,

 

While I wait for the customer's confirmation on permanently disabling system
backups, could you please delete all previous backups to free up space? The
console shows only 7 GB remaining.

 

Additionally, could you provide a breakdown of the current storage usage?
This will help me explain to the customer where the 50 GB of space is being
utilized.

Hi Pravin,

I checked the server and found the following:
The folder ""backup"", these are automatic backups (these backups are
automatically created in the backend which can be used in emergency
situations to restore a recent backup of the SQL databases) take up a lot of
space. The older backups are rarely or never required. Please let me know
how these backups are set up to run.

The folder ""mysql"", this folder contains your live database. To reduce this
size we recommend that you make use of audit log backups and delete older
event logs which may not required or necessary to be present and accessible
on the EPP Server's UI. You can archive these older event logs and store
them on an external storage location.

Server backups can be set up, modified or deleted, from System Maintenance -> System backup or System Backup V2.

You can set up the Audit Log Backup, to reduce the size of the Mysql logs, in System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup:


You can also schedule this to do it automatically:


You can than consult the backups at the bottom of the same page. They will contain all logs in a CSV format, and you can download them.

Other than that, everything is well within limits:


I deleted some more backups, I only left the first and the last one. Space is at 75% now:

Hi Botond,

 

While I wait for the customer's confirmation on permanently disabling system backups, could you please delete all previous backups to free up space? The console shows only 7 GB remaining.

 

Additionally, could you provide a breakdown of the current storage usage? This will help me explain to the customer where the 50 GB of space is being utilized.

Hello Botond,

 

The customer is using the cloud version, so there is no option to take a
System Backup. There is a snapshot option available, but it is not currently
configured.

 

Thank you for your support. You can proceed with closing this case. I will
reopen the ticket if any further assistance is needed.

 

Have a great day!
