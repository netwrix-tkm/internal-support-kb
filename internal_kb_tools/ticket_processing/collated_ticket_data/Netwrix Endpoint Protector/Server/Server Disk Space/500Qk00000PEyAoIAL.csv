Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 28.81 gb free available from 257.22 gb (11%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.

We try to liberate space in Audit log backup section without success. 
we need to delete information older than 6 months in endpoint protector

Client is having an issue with the allocated space for his EPP appliance as it is almost full and needs to free up some of it.

Connected remote along with Adrian to solve the issue the customer is facing.
We have checked the backend and from what we have found, client had around 168 GB of shadows occupying the disk.

He already had them copied through the external storage option so he agreed to have them deleted.
After deleting them, we went on and recreated the oshadow and capshadow files accordingly and tested on the UI side.
Everything was working as expected.

Agreed to keep the ticket opened for another day and he will follow up with us tomorrow.","16/05/2025
