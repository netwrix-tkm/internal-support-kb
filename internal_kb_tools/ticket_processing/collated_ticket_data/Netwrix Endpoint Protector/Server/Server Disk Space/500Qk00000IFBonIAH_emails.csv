Hello Komal,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00426863. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00426863

Ticket Details: We are getting below error.
Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 49.68 gb free available from 257.28 gb (19%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected.

Thank you for your response.  In order to delete event logs older than 1 year you will need to schedule an Audit Log Backup under ""System Maintenance"" > ""Audit Log Backup"".

See below the configuration which may be efficient for you.  You will need to select how often you would like the audit log backup to run.  Once the backup is completed it will be available to download at the bottom of the ""Audit Log Backup"" page.  Alternatively you can choose to automatically store the backups on an external shared location (network shared folder).  To do  this you will need to configure and map a shared location under ""System Maintenance"" > "" External Storage"", see the second screenshot below.








I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.



Kind regards
