"500Qk00000N7TL2IAN","00439414","Support Ticket","Low disk space","Hi,
We get a message that the server has low disk space. I wanted to check how to clear out old logs without causing any issues. We could maybe enable ""HDD Disk Space - Safety Logs Rotation. Click to enable Log Rotation"" option in System Status.","","","","The System Disk partition has about 20GB of space, around 7-10 GB(up to 50% of total disk size) are occupied by the ""vital"" components of the EPP server. If the Alert is set to trigger at 60% and display that message there, it will not affect the functionality of the EPP server. Most of the space that was cleared was related to alerts and journal entries.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","5.7","Closed - Resolved","Senior Helpers","Flakron Salihu","2025-03-19T21:20:16.000Z","2025-03-25T14:56:00.000Z"
