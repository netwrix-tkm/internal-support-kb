Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- cleared space
- rebooted the EPP server - was online for 180+ days
- checked policies
- checked resources - we recommend increasing the CPU core count from 2 to 4 and the GB of RAM from 4 to 8 in order to have a better performance
- spoke about Audit Log Backup - removes logs older than x days/months from the EPP server and archives them so you can locally download them. You can choose to keep the most recent 1-2 months of logs(what value you think is relevant here for you business) on the EPP server and archive the rest/older ones.

What I forgot to mention is to check if File Shadows is enabled, this may also generate/occupy space on the long run. This can be checked in the Device Control -> Global Settings section:


We are closing this ticket.
