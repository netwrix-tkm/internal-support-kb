I am having problems trying to purge old logs in the ""Shaow Files"" section within ""File Mantenance"", when trying to delete any logs in the list an error appears on display.

I tried to open DLP console on a new web browser, cleaning cache but it doesnÂ´t work, could you help me to investigate if this is a bug or just a problem in my environment?

Thanks a lot, keep pending on this.

Regards","","","","The shadow files were removed, we ran an audit log backup in order to keep less than 2 mil logs on the server and then the fileshadows could be removed manually from the server.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","59.9","Closed - Resolved","L'Oreal USA","Ivan Mejia","2024-10-18T14:46:02.000Z","2024-12-17T13:13:37.000Z"
