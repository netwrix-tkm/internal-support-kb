Hi Andrei,

Please provide the following information:


	 - 	Disk space
	 - 	Number of iNodes
	 - 	Number of CPUs
	 - 	RAM memory


Check if partitions were done for the logs table.

	 - 	show create table ofiletrace;
	 - 	show create table olog;
	 - 	show create table cf_log;


Check the number of logs for each log table:

	 - 	select count(1) from cf_log;
	 - 	select count(1) from olog;
	 - 	select count(1) from ofiletrace;


If partitions were created, please advise the customer to run an audit log backup and remove the logs.


Regards,
Augustina

Hi Andrei, 



Based on the information provided, there doesn't appear to be an issue with disk space.

However, the large volume of logs in the database is causing the System Information page to hang, as it calculates the number of logs in real-time—a resource-intensive operation for the server.

We recommend advising the customer to:

	 - 	Configure an Audit Log backup to reduce the number of logs.
	 - 	Adjust the File Tracing settings to capture only the necessary information.

Regards,
Augustina
