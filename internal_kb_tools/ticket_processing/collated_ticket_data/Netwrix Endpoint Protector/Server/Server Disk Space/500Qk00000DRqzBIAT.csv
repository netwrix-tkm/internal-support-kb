"500Qk00000DRqzBIAT","00415817","Support Ticket","Issue with Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800) Due to Insufficient Disk Space","Dear Support Team,

I am experiencing an error while attempting to apply the Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1. Although the update process completes with the status ""Patch applied successfully,"" the patch is not actually applied and remains available in the Endpoint Protector Server menu under Live Update - Available EPP Software Updates.

I suspect that the issue is due to insufficient disk space, as there is only 8.65 GB free out of 49.04 GB (18%).

Here is the current disk space usage:

Disk Space System: 38G used - 82% from 50G
Disk Space EPP Server: 582G used - 32% from 2.0T

We have a 2TB storage attached to the VM, and we would like to map this storage for other components/system logs to free up and increase the capacity of the 50GB system partition.

I would appreciate your assistance in freeing up space on the system to facilitate the application of this security update and any other necessary updates.

Thank you.","","","",".hotfix","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","NONE","","30.5","Closed - Resolved","FAN Courier","Danut Pirvu","2024-07-23T18:26:59.000Z","2024-08-23T06:04:00.000Z"
