From next time, will the logs be deleted automatically as per the server
configuration? Just checking so I don’t need to reach out each time. Also,
do you have any other suggestions to handle this automatically?

We took a look at what’s taking up the space and found out the following:


	There are over 30 million logs on the server, which is a really high number. These logs gathered from the last time you had disk space issues.
	Around 10 million of these logs are related to Unidentified file types


We would advise you to do the following:

	Run an Audit Log Backup to free up some extra space, if you wish, I can send you the steps.
	Go over the Content Aware Policies and only monitor what’s necessary.
	Limit, or stop monitoring Unidentified file types, since they take up around 33% of the logs.
	You can also create a File Location Allowlist if you want to skip monitoring a specific location.



We cleared some space from the Backups, but it will not last a long time, therefore, please run the Audit Log Backup as soon as possible.

Hi Ramesh,

We took a look at what’s taking up the space and found out the following:


	There are over 30 million logs on the server, which is a really high number. These logs gathered from the last time you had disk space issues.
	Around 10 million of these logs are related to Unidentified file types


We would advise you to do the following:

	Run an Audit Log Backup to free up some extra space, if you wish, I can send you the steps.
	Go over the Content Aware Policies and only monitor what’s necessary.
	Limit, or stop monitoring Unidentified file types, since they take up around 33% of the logs.
	You can also create a File Location Allowlist if you want to skip monitoring a specific location.



We cleared some space from the Backups, but it will not last a long time, therefore, please run the Audit Log Backup as soon as possible.

Hi Team,

From next time, will the logs be deleted automatically as per the server configuration? Just checking so I don’t need to reach out each time. Also, do you have any other suggestions to handle this automatically?
