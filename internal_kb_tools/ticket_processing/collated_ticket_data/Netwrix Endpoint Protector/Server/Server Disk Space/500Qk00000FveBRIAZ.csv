Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.
You will be automatically logged out in 3 minutes.","","","","The issue was resolved by cleaning the disk space in the backend. There was a big(+250GB) syslog file that we removed as the logs were already on SIEM and the customer only needed the logs from the last 3 months on the EPP Server, which were in place.","","Iosif Muntean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","DINERS CLUB PERÚ S.A.","Stephanie Santisteban","2024-09-18T14:26:55.000Z","2024-09-25T16:14:58.000Z"
