I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.


 

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi,

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.


 

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.


 

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.


 

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.

I believe things are much better. You'll have to verify usage on your end, but I've gotten significantly fewer results compared to before. We went from nearly 100,000 earlier this month to 1-2000 results now. I'm still tweaking, but we should be in much better shape.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Let's plan for 11:30 AM tomorrow if possible. It's still performing the backup supposedly and I'm stuck in little 3-minute windows.

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.

I believe things are much better. You'll have to verify usage on your end, but I've gotten significantly fewer results compared to before. We went from nearly 100,000 earlier this month to 1-2000 results now. I'm still tweaking, but we should be in much better shape.

I was finally able to get in and clear a larger number of logs, things are running more smoothly. It looks like the majority of my detections were due to it detecting us backing up files to Dropbox, and misunderstanding a lot of our documents.


 

I have turned off those detections for now, to help avoid filling the log files again. Are you free tomorrow to go through the Content Aware policies to figure out how we can reduce false positives?

I'm sorry, the system is throwing a 500 error again. I am happy to redesign any policies that need it, but right now I can't access anything, and everything I'm trying to do to reduce the amount of storage taken up is bringing the service down again.

I've finally been able to connect, but performance is slow, and it's giving me conflicting information about trying to kick off another set of logs to delete. I'm having certificate errors from some of my Mac users. Is that related to the client being able to phone back in?

Hi Cody,

Yes, it will involve screen sharing. We need to look together over the CAP policies as our developers suggested to refine them a bit as a lot of logs are generated by them.

I am able to get in and I've managed to successfully update my password, as well as started an Audit Log backup that I am currently waiting for it to finish.

 

What would we be covering in a screen share? I have a limited window today.

Hi,

 

I am getting 502 Bad Gateway errors and am still unable to get access. I thought the system was automatically deleting logs, I'll set something up as soon as I have access again.

Hi Cody,

Please try again to access the web console.

We have cleared up more space on the appliance. Our advice is to use scheduled audit log backup functionality to avoid this kind of issue with the storage.
Please let me know if the access is working now.
