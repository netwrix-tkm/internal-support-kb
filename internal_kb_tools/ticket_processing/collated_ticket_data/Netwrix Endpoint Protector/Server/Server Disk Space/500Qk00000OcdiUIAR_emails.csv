This is the ticket related to your second issue mentioned in #00443186.

In order to be able to assist you with your request, we would need more information from you.
Could you let us know how exactly you would like us to guide you through the process?
Here are the options:


	helping you in ssh to clean up the space occupied - in a remote session;
	free up the space using Audit Log Backup/File Maintenance and also check in System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup and System Backup to see if there is any list that could be downloaded and then deleted from the server - on your own/using the KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemMaintenance/Overview.htm#audit_log_backup
 

	configure External Storage (System Maintenance -> External Storage) - on your own/using the KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemMaintenance/Overview.htm#external_storage

Once you confirm which option is suitable for you, we will proceed further.

Looking forward to your reply.
