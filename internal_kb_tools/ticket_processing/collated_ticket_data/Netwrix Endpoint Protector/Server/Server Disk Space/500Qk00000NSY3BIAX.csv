Â 
'WEB
Spiralyze ID: undefined | Can not access our hosted endproint protector at https://tq9ta2b.hosted.endpointprotector.com'","","","","We have taken a look in the backend of the EPP server and saw that the log partition was full(100%). We cleared as much space as we could, but we saw that you have close to 15 million logs and 47 million file trace logs.

Please use the Audit Log backup functionality to archive these logs and remove them from the EPP server. This can be done from System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup.

Also please reduce the number of computers that file tracing applies to or disable this functionality as it also generates a lot of logs. This can be done from Device Control -> Global Settings -> File Tracing -> deselect it.

The UI of the EPP server should be accessible now.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","5.6","Closed - Resolved","Terry Hines & Associates","Norm Hayes","2025-03-28T22:09:47.000Z","2025-04-03T12:05:03.000Z"
