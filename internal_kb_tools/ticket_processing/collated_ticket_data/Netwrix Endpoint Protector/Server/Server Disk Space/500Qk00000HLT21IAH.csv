We came across this issue of low disk space on our newer server last day and we added an extra 20GB on GCP and that didnt seem to do the trick and we got prompted for a notification stating 3.4gb only available. Can we connect on a call to clear some older files from the backend please ?","","the disk space issue was caused by the audit log that created the backups. it was cleared two days later after it was done","we need to wait for the customer to get all the internal approvals for the optimizations proposed and will check back in 2 weeks from today (December 30 2024)","increased the partition size","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","120.1","Closed - Resolved","Arista Networks, Inc.","Bharani M","2024-10-22T17:17:25.000Z","2025-02-19T18:52:13.000Z"
