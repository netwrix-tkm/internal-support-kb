Hi,

In case of a large number of shadows it is possible that the server cannot handle deleting the directory.

Please try a more granular approach: click on the File Name and delete the directories inside one by one.

An alternative to remove the shadows is to make an Audit Log Backup. If options from Keep or delete logs from server when creating the backup are not checked the Audit will delete the shadows associated to the logs.

If this does not work for the customer then please send us a printscreen with :

--- CODE ---
show create table cf_log;
show create table ofiletrace;
--- CODE ---

Enable errors for the UI:

--- CODE ---
               vim /EPPServer/sieratool/web/index.php
--- CODE ---

        - search for line :

--- CODE ---
               define('SF_DEBUG',        false);
--- CODE ---


	 - 	edit it and set it to true (it should look like this :  define('SF_DEBUG',        true);)


	 - 	go to the UI and try to delete a shadow 


	 - 	make a printscreen of the error that shows in the UI


	 - 	!! go back to

--- CODE ---vim /EPPServer/sieratool/web/index.php--- CODE ---
    -> define('SF_DEBUG',        false);  and set the value back to false;

Thanks

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi,


I created a task with an improvement for this issue.

As a workaround , please advice the customer to start an Audit Content Aware Log to remove some of the old CAP logs.

When the CAP log number gets under 2 partitions (2 million logs) a cron script will  add some fields to cf_log table. The cron starts automatically at 23:00 (there is no need for user intervention to start it). 



After the cron script runs, there will be no more errors on the File Maintenance delete action.


If you have any questions please let me know.
