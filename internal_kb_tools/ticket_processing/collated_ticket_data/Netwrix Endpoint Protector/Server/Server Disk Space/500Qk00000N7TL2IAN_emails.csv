The System Disk partition has about 20GB of space, around 7-10 GB(up to 50% of total disk size) are occupied by the ""vital"" components of the EPP server. If the Alert is set to trigger at 60% and display that message there, it will not affect the functionality of the EPP server. Most of the space that was cleared was related to alerts and journal entries.

If you see that message/alert coming up in the future and it says that you still have 35% disk free, this is okay, and the server will function as normal. Issues may occur when it reaches 95-100% occupied.

You can always let us know and we will connect to the backend and clear some disk space, if needed.

I have raised your concerns internally regarding the size of the partition(20 GB) to be possibly increased in the future.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide, or if we can close this ticket.

Hi Flakron,

Please give us your approval to access the backend of your EPP server in order to clear space. We will then request access from our devops team.

After we have your approval we will access the backend of your EPP server and get back to you with our findings.

Best Regards,
