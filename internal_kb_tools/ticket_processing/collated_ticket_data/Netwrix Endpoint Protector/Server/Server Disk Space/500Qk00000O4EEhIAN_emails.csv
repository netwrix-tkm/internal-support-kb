Thank you for reaching out !

We have scheduled a remote session for today at 16:00 IST and the meeting details will be sent in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom


Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,
As we discussed during the call, we’ve increased the disk space on the EPP server. However, the updated space is not reflected in the UI console.
Could you kindly let us know if there’s anything we need to do on the server side to make the changes visible?
Best regards,

Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for reaching out !

We have scheduled a remote session for today at 16:00 IST and the meeting details will be sent in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom


Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

As we discussed during the call, we’ve increased the disk space on the EPP server. However, the updated space is not reflected in the UI console.

Could you kindly let us know if there’s anything we need to do on the server side to make the changes visible?

Best regards,

Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for reaching out !

We have scheduled a remote session for today at 16:00 IST and the meeting details will be sent in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom


Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Dina,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have scheduled the session for today at 13:30 IST and forwarded the details in a separate email.

In the meeting we will increase the disk space, so prior to the meeting please take a Snapshot from the virtualisation environment of the EPP VM.

Have a nice day ahead!

As we discussed during the call, we’ve increased the disk space on the EPP server. However, the updated space is not reflected in the UI console.
Could you kindly let us know if there’s anything we need to do on the server side to make the changes visible?

Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for reaching out !

We have scheduled a remote session for today at 16:00 IST and the meeting details will be sent in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom


Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

As we discussed during the call, we’ve increased the disk space on the EPP server. However, the updated space is not reflected in the UI console.

Could you kindly let us know if there’s anything we need to do on the server side to make the changes visible?

Best regards,

Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for reaching out !

We have scheduled a remote session for today at 16:00 IST and the meeting details will be sent in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom


Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
