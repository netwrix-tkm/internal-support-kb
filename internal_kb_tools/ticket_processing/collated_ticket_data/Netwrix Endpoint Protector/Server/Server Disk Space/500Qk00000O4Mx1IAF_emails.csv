Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

In order to extend the partition of the Endpoint Protector server appliance, we will need to have a remote session and access the server backend to perform the procedure.  Are you available tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST for a remote session?

Kind regards

Thank you for confirming.  I have scheduled the remote session for 2:30 PM IST tomorrow and sent you the meeting invitation.

As during the remote we will need to access the EPP Server via SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (Azure).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom


Kind regards
