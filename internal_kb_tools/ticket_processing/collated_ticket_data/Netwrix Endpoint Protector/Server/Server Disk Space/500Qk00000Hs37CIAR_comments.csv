Hi @WaitingOnDevOps,

We have an urgent case for NPI LLC:

""Description

Customer Name: NPI LLC
- ACV: 5,064
- Components: Web Console
- OS: NA
- EPP Server Version: 5.9.2.0
- Agent Version: NA
- Endpoints affected: NA


Hi Team,

The customer reported that the EPP server is down and cannot connect to the UI. The /var/eppfiles were occupying all the disk space and we performed a disk cleanup.

After this procedure, the 502 Bad Gateway error page is displayed.
The ifconfig command returned the following result:
root@eppserver:/usr/bin]$ ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163 mtu 9001

Seems that eth1 network is missing
The server is hosted by us: Production NPI - https://54.85.101.159/""

Could you please have a look?

Thank you,

Please make sure that the folder is correct. We get a 404 when trying to access it.

Hi Iosif, 

Please try to run the following command. This will clean the empty files from the workers directories.

find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/1/ -type f -size 0 -delete

find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/2/ -type f -size 0 -delete
find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/3/ -type f -size 0 -delete
find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/4/ -type f -size 0 -delete
find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/5/ -type f -size 0 -delete


Also, before and after running the above command please check the iNodes.

Thanks,
Augustina

@WaitingOnEngineer

more details on this machine:


Quicklogs workers folders are occupying most of the space:


there are no 0-sized files there:


quicklogs was empty one day ago, now disk is full again, so, we expect logs are not processed for any reason.
Need development investigation.

Notes: 
  - after reset, the server starts, UI is up, however, after a while, because of missing space, processes are freezing and the page can't be accessed anymore.

I connected to the server and noticed that the customer’s approach to using the policies could be improved.

The workers are functioning, but due to the way the policies are configured, a large number of logs are generated, leading to low disk space.

Solution:

	 - 	The customer should be advised to configure the policies to monitor only what is truly necessary, rather than checking all exit points and PIIs. 
	 - 	increase the resources on the server (the number of  CPUs and RAM);

We had today a remote connection with the customer but were unable to log into the web console to check the CAP policies, after entering the credentials the page stayed on loading until timed-out. The customer tried to log in multiple times today but is still getting timed-out or 502 errors.

I saw in the backend that the memory is just 2GB RAM and is always at 100% usage, is there a way to make the server accessible in order to refine the CAP policies?

@WaitingOnEngineer
We propose to increase, temporary, the hardware resources for this instance, so that can be enough room to do your reconfiguration, as @Augustina Sidor suggested.
After your part of the task is complete, we will revert the hardware resources to original state.
