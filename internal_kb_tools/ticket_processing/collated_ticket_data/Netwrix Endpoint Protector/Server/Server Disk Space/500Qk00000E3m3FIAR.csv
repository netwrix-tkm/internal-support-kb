"500Qk00000E3m3FIAR","00417168","Support Ticket","Support to extend VM disk space","Hi team,

Following up ticket #416461, we would like to clarify below information:
1. Persistent disk for the VM is set as 320Gb at very beginning.
2. Last zoom session shows the total disk space allocated by EP server is ~120GB only
So my question is, where is the rest 200 GB disk space?","","","","disk increased","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Disk Space","","","2.4","Closed - Resolved","TrustingSocial","Linh Hoang","2024-08-06T04:29:44.000Z","2024-08-08T13:52:46.000Z"
