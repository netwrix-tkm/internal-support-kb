Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend.

Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

I understand your request, and before any escalation, we should have a meeting to discuss what needs to be done to stop the issues you are having.
The mailer problems are not caused by the server but by an SMTP server issue which is out of our control. We need to check the settings and the connection with the SMTP server.
Since I do not have the availability of the customer or the timezone, here is my availability for today in the EST timezone: 1 - 2 PM and 4 -5 PM
If that does not work, please send me the timezone and availability of the customer so I can set it up.
I will connect again to the server and free up some disk space.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

Hi Marisela,

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

Hi Marisela,

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.

Thank you,

The disk space seems really stable right now. It is sitting at 33% used disk space and it doesn't seem to increase at the rate we have seen prior to the meeting on Monday.
Let me know what the customer is seeing in the console, and monitor it until next week and we see what we can do from there.

Thank you,

Hi Marisela,

That is an automatic procedure that closes tickets that are not replied to.
As I mentioned in my earlier emails, we need to set up a remote session with the customer to properly address the issue since it is not dependent on our server, but on the SMTP server that is not hosted by us.
So, again, can you please check with the customer and send me their availability so I can set up the meeting?
Please reply to this email so I know you received it.

Hi Marisela,

It should be accessible again. The main issue is that there are a lot of mailer items that are not delivered and they keep gathering in the server but are unable to be processed.
The SMTP settings and the alerts set on the server, need to be revised.
Let me know how you would like to proceed, set up a remote session to check it out or is it something you and the customer can handle?

Sure, you can review the backend. 
 

And we will wait for your comments or suggestions to avoid another issue.

Hi Marisela,

Do I have your approval to access the backend again and see what is causing the issue?
Since this is the third occurrence in a relatively short time that the disk space is filled, after I check and make sure they can access the console, we need to make sure it does not happen again, so I will have some pointers or requests.
