Thank you for your email.
Unfortunately we couldn't find a server that is hosted by us with the mentioned IP or server ID, can you please check if the server ID is the same one, maybe even to send us a screenshot of the server ID?
Can it be that the informations from the ticket are not accurate and that the server you are mentioning is not hosted on the Netwrix side?

Best regards,
