Client is facing issues with accessing the EPP Console.

2025.05.01
We had a remote session and in our remote session we discovered that the disk space usage for customer's Endpoint Protector appliance was 500GB which filled up the physical hard disk of their hypervisor leaving no free disk space, this created an issue whereby the EPP Server Appliance could not run and function properly and thus the reason why they could not access the web UI of their EPP Server.  Customer allocated 320 GB of the physical hard disk to their EPP Server Appliance but 500 GB was used.  This is because the other 180 GB was utilized by the 6 snapshots that were stored.
After they have deleted the older snapshots, they managed to free up the 180 GB and when they rebooted their EPP Sever appliance we observed that it resumed to operate normally as expected.","30/04/2025
