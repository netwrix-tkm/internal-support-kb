Do you have an audit log backup process scheduled ?
The first step is to make sure that you have an audit log backup process scheduled from server UI > System Maintenance > Audit Log Backup, as can be seen in the following example (e.g. frequency every week, target logs older than 1 month). 

This will archive periodically the logs/ events which are older than the configured threshold. Make sure to save changes by clicking the Schedule button:



Afterwards if the issue persists let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session using Zoom.

HI Alin,

I just enabled this, as shown in the attached image. When should I expect
to see the effects and notice the freed-up space?

Also how can we ssh into the server to expand the disk size ?

Once the backup process finishes to archive logs you will see a new entry under System Maintenance - Audit Log Backup - Backup List, where you will be able to download the log archive if you need it.
Only the support team has ssh acesss to the server. Once the audit log backup finishes, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session using Zoom if you'd like to expand the disk size.

Hi Alin,

My current time zone is BST (British Summer Time), based in London,
England. I believe scheduling a remote session to address the space issue
and potentially expand it would be beneficial. I will be unavailable next
week but will return on the 25th, so we can arrange a suitable time for the
session. Our working hours are between 8 am and 5 pm BST.
