• What is the impact of the issue on your business? If the management server runs out of space it will become unusable.
• Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried? I have deleted a backup file to gain about 1.5GB back. The shadow files I'm unable to delete. The system crashes. I have had this issue for a long time. A support person generally gets on a zoom meeting with me, logs into the management console with elevated rights, and deletes the shadow files manually.
• What are you trying to do or accomplish? Redundant question
• When did this issue start? two years ago
• Can you please let us know the Client, Server, OS version (if not already known) on which the situation is encountered? This detail is asked in the standard ticket questions and have already been answered.
• On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, Google cloud platform, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS). This has also already been answered in your standard ticket questions (on-prem)
• Screen shots, logs, other artifacts, etc.
