Customer BioCatch is doing a POC of Endpoint Protector, server hosted by us; version 5.9.3.0.

URL: https://t08um2j.hosted.endpointprotector.com/
Server ID: LEPPBBGN

They are facing an issue where Block & Report / Block & Remediate CAP policies are correctly applied and working, but the logs for those violations are not displayed in the admin console. It happens on two computers running on macOS Sonoma, that have the 3.0.2.2 agent installed.
On the server side, both vulnerability hotfixes were applied as well.

See attached client logs collected earlier today that captured violations when the policy was set to Report Only and then changed to Block & Report; as well as some screenshots.

Thank you!","","","","new VA","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","","","","6.1","Closed - Resolved","BioCatch","Daniel Itenberg","2024-07-17T09:08:36.000Z","2024-07-23T12:25:16.000Z"
