User getting error while running Framework from Terminal for Xcode Application on MAC. Four users are running the same work.

First user can run the code without error if EPP is disabled.

For second user even after disabling EPP, it does not work.

For third user, everything works properly without disabling EPP.

All Users are in same policy and same group. All users have same OS version on their MAC's. Intercept VPN is enabled for all users.

EPP version is also same for all users.

There is no CAP logs available on the Console. Also there is no EPP Block notification on user's computer.

User is using the following steps -

1.The user is building SPMReport (our/users) which will be available /deployed under Field Insights app

And Field Insights will(have tab of reports in their application)

 

2.For spm reports to be in Field insights- user is creating a framework first (where they run file script.sh file in their project folder path)- it gives error - archive failed

 

3.Then user create pod/dependences/packges of this spm reports and/to install in Field insight — when they archive this field insights or even build it…. it gives below error:

xcodebuild archive -workspace ${WORKSPACE}.xcworkspace -scheme ${SCHEME} -archivePath ""${ARCHIVE_PATH_IOS_SIMULATOR}.xcarchive"" -destination ""generic/platform=iOS Simulator"" -sdk iphonesimulator SKIP_INSTALL=NO BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES
