Based on the remote session from July 31, I observed that the server contains logs not saved into the database. However, the workers cannot process these logs due to insufficient server resources.

The customer should be advised to increase the server resources as soon as possible.
After the resources were increased the system should be rebooted.

"00aQk000008LusDIAS","500Qk00000DlXHBIA3","Hi Javaign,

I just left you a voicemail, as my call went unanswered. I wanted to let you know that I’m working with the Netwrix/CoSosys team to resolve the issues with your logs. We are planning to upgrade your backend environment tomorrow (Romanian Time), which DevOps/R&D suspects is causing the current log issue. We’ll have a clearer picture after the upgrade and some testing.

We’ll provide an update tomorrow morning following these steps.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
Stacy

"00aQk000008Lvl3IAC","500Qk00000DlXHBIA3","Paul Rooney approved and authorized a back end resource increase per Bogdan's suggestion. At this time, there will be no price adjustment for the customer and we will absorb the $480 per year fee. We will work to recoup these fee's upon renewal in 2026. I left the customer a voicemail with the plan and next steps. The customer was given my phone number should he want to reach back out to me.
Our next steps are:
1) Paul to engage DevOps to increase the size of their backend environment on 06Aug, morning Romanian time.
2) Testing to follow and we will engage DevOps/R&D if we do not see the results we are anticipating towards resolution.
3) Contact customer with any new findings tomorrow 06Aug.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-08-05T18:18:59.000Z","2024-08-05T18:18:59.000Z","false","false"

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan It was suggested by Augustina (R&D) that an increase in RAM would allow the logs to be processed on the server. So we had DevOps make that change on 06Aug. In testing after the backend change, the logs are still not being processed on the server. We need R&D assistance at your earliest convenience on 06Aug.
