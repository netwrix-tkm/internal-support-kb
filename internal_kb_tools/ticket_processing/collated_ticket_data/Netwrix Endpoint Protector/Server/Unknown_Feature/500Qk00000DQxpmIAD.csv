I'm opening current ticket on behalf of Booking.com team.
Can you please advise on the availability for a remote session on Wednesday, 24th July at 4:00PM Amsterdam time for assisting Booking.com team while applying hotfix 1.1. on EPP server version 5.9.3.0. (hotfix 1.0. was not applied here) and afterwards checking the custom port settings?
