Thank you for your email.
I have investigated this on the server side and I believe that because the initial hotfix(v1.0) was applied on the 5.9.1.0 version, after you've updated to 5.9.3.0, the new hotfix needs to be applied again (v1.1).
So I will ask you to please apply the 1.1 hotfix again, wait until it is 100% applied and then check if the logs are present.

Best regards,
Alin Anca
