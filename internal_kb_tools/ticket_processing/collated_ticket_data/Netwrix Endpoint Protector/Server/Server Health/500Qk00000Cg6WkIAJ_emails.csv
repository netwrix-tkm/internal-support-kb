The best option here would be to schedule a remote session with the customer and check connectivity and collect logs if we can't figure out why the clients are not connecting to the server.

I asked my colleagues where I can find their server so I can take a look in the backend to see what's wrong.
We can schedule the remote session, but if the console is unavailable, we can't do anything.
As a side note, the agents do their job even if they can't connect to the server.
I will get back to you as soon as I have access to their server.

Hi Lucas,

The best option here would be to schedule a remote session with the customer and check connectivity and collect logs if we can't figure out why the clients are not connecting to the server.

Hi Lucas,

If the server is hosted by us, the customer name is enough, but I can't find them in our list.

Hi Lucas,

I asked my colleagues where I can find their server so I can take a look in the backend to see what's wrong.
We can schedule the remote session, but if the console is unavailable, we can't do anything.
As a side note, the agents do their job even if they can't connect to the server.
I will get back to you as soon as I have access to their server.

Hello Botond,

Do you have availability for today to check with us about this point? If
not, let me know your schedule for tomorrow.
The costumer installed the 1.1 hotfix but we still can see some issues on
the server.

Unfortunately I can't today, but I'm free tomorrow from 12:00 - 15:00 Brazil time.
In the meantime, could you check if the server's IP is set correctly on the clients?
I had a similar issue yesterday, and I believe the customer just installed the agent they were sent by email, without modifying the server's address.

Hi Lucas,

Unfortunately I can't today, but I'm free tomorrow from 12:00 - 15:00 Brazil time.
In the meantime, could you check if the server's IP is set correctly on the clients?
I had a similar issue yesterday, and I believe the customer just installed the agent they were sent by email, without modifying the server's address.

Hello Botond, 
 

Do you have availability for today to check with us about this point? If not, let me know your schedule for tomorrow.
The costumer installed the 1.1 hotfix but we still can see some issues on the server.

 

Best regards,

Hi Lucas,

If the server is hosted by us, the customer name is enough, but I can't find them in our list.

Hello Botond,
 

What do you need to get the access to the SSH? i though the customers name was enough.

 

Best regards,

Hi Lucas,

I asked my colleagues where I can find their server so I can take a look in the backend to see what's wrong.
We can schedule the remote session, but if the console is unavailable, we can't do anything.
As a side note, the agents do their job even if they can't connect to the server.
I will get back to you as soon as I have access to their server.

Hello Botond,
 

Lets schedule for 13h BRT today, then, the costumer is getting error 504 already (bad gateway).

Hi Lucas,

The best option here would be to schedule a remote session with the customer and check connectivity and collect logs if we can't figure out why the clients are not connecting to the server.
