I'm wondering if we can have a sense check on our EPP product to make sure we have enough resource to run it without issues.

Reason being we have started to receive alerts some mornings showing a high CPU spike though it only lasts a few minutes, we have also noticed the EPP portal is pretty much unusable between 9:00 and 10:00am every day.

We are on the latest version of EPP - 5.9.4.0

The Azure VM resource we have that runs EPP is running under D4s_v3 that gives us 4 x vCPUs, 16 RAM (GiB) and 8 Data Disks.

We have 3150 licenses for EPP with around 2500 in use at one time, our current computer  device count is 3281.

Final query is there anyway to automatically delete machines that have not been connected for so many days at the moment we have to keep going in and manually deleting one's that are no longer active.

Many Thanks
