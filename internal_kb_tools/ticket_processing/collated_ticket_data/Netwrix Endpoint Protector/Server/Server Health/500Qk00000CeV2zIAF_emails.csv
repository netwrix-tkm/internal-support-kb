This issue initially occurred back in July of last year when we had to roll back a server change. Due to this change, some events seemed to occur out of date. I don't think this would've occurred since, so would it be alright to close this ticket out?

Thanks!
Andrew

Hello Lisa,

I am reviewing the tickets that are still open and this one you wanted to keep open to monitor. Did the issue reoccur, or can we close the case?

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
