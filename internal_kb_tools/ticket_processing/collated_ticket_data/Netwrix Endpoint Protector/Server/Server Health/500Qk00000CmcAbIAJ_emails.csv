Eduard,

The Cert was added/updated using these instructions:

[cid:12961ea8-706f-4119-b31a-63f99f5241bc]

It is a wildcard. I just checked and the server still indicates that the certificate has not been updated.

Access to the backend is not provided out of the box, that comes after a whole legal process. But I can upload and enable the certificate and key on the server. For that, I will need a .crt and .key files to overwrite the ones already there.
For copying, we will need an FTP client like Filezilla or CoreFTP.
Please make sure we have SSH access to the server and a snapshot of the appliance before we have our meeting.
Send me your timezone and availability for tomorrow and Friday and I will set it up.

Hi Stephen,

Access to the backend is not provided out of the box, that comes after a whole legal process. But I can upload and enable the certificate and key on the server. For that, I will need a .crt and .key files to overwrite the ones already there.
For copying, we will need an FTP client like Filezilla or CoreFTP.
Please make sure we have SSH access to the server and a snapshot of the appliance before we have our meeting.
Send me your timezone and availability for tomorrow and Friday and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

""When copying the certificate, did you also include the lines with ----- BEGIN----- and -------END------?
If not, please also include those as in the backend the process does not know to add them.""

 

 

These were included the first and subsequent attempts to update the certificate.

 

""Please let me know if you are still not able to see the certificate change after 5 - 10 minutes after you add them again.""

 

I even restarted the vAppliance but to no avail. Still has the old certificate. Are there CLI instructions for updating the certificate on the vAppliance? I am willing to try that if necessary.

 

Thank you,

Since it is a .pem file, it might contain the entire chain, so add all certificates from there not just the first one.
Please let me know if you are still not able to see the certificate change after 5 - 10 minutes after you add them again.

Eduard,

 

The Cert was added/updated using these instructions:

 



 

It is a wildcard. I just checked and the server still indicates that the certificate has not been updated.

 

Thank you,

Hi Stephen,

Can you provide more details, please?
Where did you add the certificate and is the certificate a wildcard or was it created particularly for the appliance?

Thank you,
