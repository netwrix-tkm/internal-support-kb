I'm not able to reach the service. The Server Response with a ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT Error. The url I try to open is <a href='https://ryp97b8.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>ryp97b8.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>.
Thats why I could fill in the Server ID and Server Version. 
Could you fix this behaviour ?
