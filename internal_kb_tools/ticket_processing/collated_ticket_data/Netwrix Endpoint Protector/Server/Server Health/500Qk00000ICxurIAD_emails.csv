The costumer asked if there is any log to check so we can see the reason of
the problem.
Is it possible to understand the problem without waiting for it to happen
again?

One possible cause for yesterday's error may be a log rotation issue that filed the system partition. At the restart the log rotation starts again clearing the space and so the EPP processes.
We can try to search in the system logs to see if there are errors. For this, we need to schedule a remote session.
