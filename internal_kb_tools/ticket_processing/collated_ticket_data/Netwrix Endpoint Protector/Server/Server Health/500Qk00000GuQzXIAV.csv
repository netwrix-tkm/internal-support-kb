"500Qk00000GuQzXIAV","00423637","Support Ticket","11078 Network Printers and no other Devices shown in Device Control","On the Device Control Tab we have currently 11078 almost identical network printers and it shows no other devices. We do not have that amount of network printers. When searched for a specific device like devicetype ""bluetooth"" it correctly lists all available bluetooth devices.
Since there are so many identical network printers we have no real overlook over the devices. Also the appliance is still on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS. How can we upgrade the server?","","","","ff","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","45.3","Closed - Resolved","Stadt Allendorf (Lumda)","JÃ¼rgen Rausch","2024-10-11T06:34:37.000Z","2024-11-25T14:16:28.000Z"
