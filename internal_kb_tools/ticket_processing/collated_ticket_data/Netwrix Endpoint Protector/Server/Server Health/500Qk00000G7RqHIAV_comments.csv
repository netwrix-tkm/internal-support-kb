For performance reasons, we will use the limit to set the deleted flag to 1.
The flag ""deleted"" indicates that this computer has been removed and will not appear on the Computers page.
If you have 10,000 computers, you will need to run this query 10 times.
I have included '2024-06-01' in the SQL query, but please note that the date can be changed.

We had a remote session with the customer today and ran the command which was give but it did not give the expected results.  According to the SQL result only 57 computers were deleted.  According to the computer count on the dashboard there were only 55 deleted.  Before there was a computer count of 15,842 and after we ran the command the count is 15,787

There are +10,000 computers that are ""unlicensed"" and ""Offline"" with last dates older than 1st December 2022.  You can see in the screenshot the filter which we applied and arranged by last seen date from the oldest to the latest, the latest being on the bottom of page 20.

We ran the following command:

--- CODE ---
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL AND (trialversion < 1 OR trialversion IS NULL) LIMIT 1000;
--- CODE ---

Could you please look at the screenshots of today with ""2024.10.03"" in the title and advise on how we should adjust the command to get the desired result of deleting computers that are ""Unlicensed"" and ""Offline"" with last seen date older than x amount of days?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-03T10:38:27.000Z","2024-10-03T10:38:27.000Z","false","false"

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Please try the following SQL command:

--- CODE ---
SELECT count(id) from clientmachine where where lastseen < '2022-12-01'; 
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;

I had a remote session with the customer today to run the SQL commands given.

The count on dashboard is 18,124 but when I ran --- CODE ---
SELECT count(id) from clientmachine where lastseen < '2022-12-01';
--- CODE ---
the count on live database showed 23,210

After I ran the update command --- CODE ---
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;
--- CODE --

the result returned with only 13 rows affected.

Please see the screenshots uploaded to attachments folder.

It will look bad if we have a 3rd remote session with the customer without a resolution.  
Can we request the intervention by a developer for the next remote session please? 

@Oana-Cristina Rus kindly confirm if you would be available to join in for short call wit the customer so that we may meet customer's requirements on call?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-04T12:47:22.000Z","2024-10-04T12:47:22.000Z","false","false"

After we reviewed all the informations that you provided us, it would be helpful for us if you could check the following:


--- CODE ---
select count(1) from clientmachine where deleted = 0 and lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL;

--- CODE ---

It will count all computers that have not been deleted and have last been seen before 2022-12-01.

After that, please run the following command:

--- CODE ---
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;
--- CODE ---

You must run the previous command x times.
x is being calculated in the following manner:
The number of client machines that are not deleted and have last seen older than 2022-12-01 (step 1) / 1000.
E.g. If you have 18k => 18000/1000 => 18
Please notice that if you run this SQL more than 18 times is not a problem.

--- CODE ---
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 2000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 3000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 4000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 6000;
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 7000;
....
UPDATE clientmachine set deleted = 1 where lastseen < '2022-12-01' and lastseen IS NOT NULL LIMIT 18000;

--- CODE ---


In case the above method doesn't work, please provide us with any additional information about the computers that were supposed to be deleted but haven't been.

Thank you for the feedback however since we already had three emote sessions with the customer, two of which the SQL commands did not work can we please request that dev resource to be on standby in the next remote session with the customer?
