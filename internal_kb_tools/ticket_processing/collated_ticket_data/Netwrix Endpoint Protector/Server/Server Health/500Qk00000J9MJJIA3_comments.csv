Hi, 

The dashboard information is taken from files located in the /EPPServer/appliance/dashbordData/ directory. Some crons update these files every day.


Check if dashboardData directory exists, and has the right owner and permission

	 - 	ls -la /EPPServer/appliance.
	 - 	make sure the permissions are set correctly: 

	 - 	chmod 0755  /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData
	 - 	chown www-data:www-data  /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData


Please check if the files exist on the server, and if the owner and permissions are set correctly.


	 - 	  cd /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/
	 - 	 ls -la

	 - 	three files should be displayed: 

	 - 	capDashboard.json (used for Content-Aware Dasbord ) - if the module is available

	 - 	eDiscoveryDashboard.json (used for eDiscovery Dashboard) - if the module is available

	 - 	dcDashboard.json - used for the DC dashboard and General dashboard

	 - 	make sure the permissions are set to 644 and the owner is www-data:www-data or just set them using the following commands:

	 - 	chown www-data:www-data  /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/file_name

	 - 	chmod 0644 /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/file_name


	 - 	replace the file_name with the appropriate file name
If the above steps, didn't fix the problem, please delete the files from  /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/, and run the following cron job to recreate them:

	 - 	rm  /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/dcDashboard.json
	 - 	php /EPPServer/appliance/operations/prepareDcDashboard.php



Regards,
Augustina
