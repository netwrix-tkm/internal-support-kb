⚠ Please check if the SMTP config is set and if it's working properly.  Please confirm if the customer is receiving the test email.

If the above statements are confirmed, please regenerate the alert cache, following the next steps:


	 - 	Stop the cron service: 

	 - 	service cron stop
	 - 	clear the mailer folder: 

	 - 	rm /var/eppfiles/mailer/*
	 - 	login to MySQL and empty the mailer table

	 - 	delete from mailer;
	 - 	Regenerate the alerts cache:

	 - 	delete the existing cache

	 - 	rm -rf /run/shm/mcache/cf_alerts/
	 - 	rm -rf /run/shm/mcache/dc_alerts/
	 - 	login to MySQL and delete the following tables (it's safe to delete them. They will be recreated once the rebuild alert cache cron runs)

	 - 	drop table old_alert;
	 - 	drop table old_cf_alert; 
	 - 	run the cron to regenerate the alert cache:

	 - 	php /opt/eppworker/build_alerts_cache.php
	 - 	check if the alerts cache was recreated:

	 - 	ls -la /run/shm/mcache/cf_alerts/
	 - 	ls -la  /run/shm/mcache/dc_alerts/
	 - 	start the corn service:

	 - 	service cron start


After all these steps are done, please generate an event to see if the email alert will be received.

If not, please provide us with more details, like:

	 - 	the size and the content of the mailer folder

	 - 	du -sh /var/eppfiles/mailer/
	 - 	ls -la /var/eppfiles/mailer/
	 - 	a print screen with the alerts cache

	 - 	ls -la /run/shm/mcache/cf_alerts/
	 - 	ls -la  /run/shm/mcache/dc_alerts/
	 - 	a printscreen with the content from the mailer table

	 - 	SELECT * FROM mailer;

Thanks,
Augustina
