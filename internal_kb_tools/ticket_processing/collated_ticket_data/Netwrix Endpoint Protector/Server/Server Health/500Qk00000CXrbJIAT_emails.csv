Is it hosted in a local VM or a cloud environment?
We should also set up a remote session and try to figure out if we can find anything on the server side.
Let me know your timezone and availability and I will set it up.

Hi Josh,

I apologize for today's meeting. I had a power failure and I was not able to connect to let you know.
Can we please reschedule for Friday or next week since tomorrow is a bank holiday for you?
