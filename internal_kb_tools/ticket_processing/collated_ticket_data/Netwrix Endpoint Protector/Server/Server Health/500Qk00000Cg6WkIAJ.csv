I suspect a bug is ocurring after the hotfix, the computers seems to be not comunnicating with the server after the hotfix was applied. I know of a bug that we are facing with another costumer and it reallys look like it.
Ciandt has the EPP hosted on cososys side, so if any need be, should be an easy fix. Let me know the approach.

Best regards,","","","","We changed the server's IP address on the agents and the issue was solved","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","7.9","Closed - Resolved","FcBrasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-07-04T19:49:38.000Z","2024-07-12T16:36:52.000Z"
