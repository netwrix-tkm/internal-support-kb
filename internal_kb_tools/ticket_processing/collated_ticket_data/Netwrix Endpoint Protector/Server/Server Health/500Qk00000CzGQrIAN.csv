"500Qk00000CzGQrIAN","00414855","Support Ticket","Error for failed to start a high performance web server during appliance boot","Hello,
as a Netwrix partner, i am trying to install on our systems the EP appliance using the version reported, but i cannot access the web interface: it seems the web server fails to start.
I can see the error for ""failed to start a high performance web server"" during the virtual appliance boot.

I tried both the VMWare and Hyper-v versions, and both have the same issue.

Please let me know what i can do to resolve.
Thank you.
Massimo.","","","","The VM did not have 2 network cards attached. Once the customer's attached the 2nd network card the EPP VM booted correctly.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","0.3","Closed - Resolved","SSI Sviluppo Sistemi Informativi srl - Dis","Massimo Chierici","2024-07-12T11:08:13.000Z","2024-07-12T19:01:02.000Z"
