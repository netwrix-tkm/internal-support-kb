During the remote connection, we optimized the server.
We also checked the external storage setting. Unfortunately, when running the mount command, we encountered an error stating that the file was not present.
My recommendation would be to open another ticket regarding this.
Also if the customer can confirm the mount point used on their External storage, as well as if the user connected has the right to write on the external storage location.

Kind regards
