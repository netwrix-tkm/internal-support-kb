"500Qk00000CeV2zIAF","00414020","Support Ticket","[Comerica] Content Aware Report is not ordered by date","Comerica's content aware report is not ordered descending by the ""Date/Time(Client)"" column when it is first opened. This can also be seen in the SE environment (8yx79ru.hosted.endpointprotector.com) where some events that took place on 7/2 appear after events that took place on 7/1.

Yesterday, Comerica's QA environment was rolled back to before the first hotfix was applied. The only logs that remain in the environment now were from before the first hotfix and after the second hotfix was applied. This would mean that the issue where logs got ""caught"" in the backend never occurred in this environment, yet the entries are still out of date.","","","Issue originally occurred due to rolling back a server version so some events were displayed out of date. Requesting permission to close.","Issue has not reproduced in a while. Maria will reopen if the behavior is seen again.","","Andrew Siemasko","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","259.9","Closed - Resolved","Comerica Bank","Maria De La Garza","2024-07-03T22:48:44.000Z","2025-03-20T19:30:51.000Z"
