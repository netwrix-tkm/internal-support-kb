Good day!
We have a customer that reported their EPP server having a warning showing the EPP Server's logs are full.
We have tried to get user to download the older Audit Log Backup files, and then delete the already downloaded files from the Audit Log Backup.

However, user states when they click on ""Download"" the Audit Log backup, they are unable to download the files, as there is no popup / no activity that happens when they start the download.

User has also informed their SFTP connectivity to their backup server has broken, and hence the audit log backup files weren't transferred to that backup server :(

We have gotten user's availability tomorrow and they are available at 4PM (GMT+8) for a remote call.
Please assign this ticket to someone as this is urgent for the user.

Thank you!","","Space is occupied by shadows.
