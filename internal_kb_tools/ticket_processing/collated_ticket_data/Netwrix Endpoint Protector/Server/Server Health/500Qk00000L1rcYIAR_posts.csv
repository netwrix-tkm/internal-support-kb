'Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 4.67 gb free available from 19.52 gb (24%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.'

Could this be resolved please as I believe this is something that needs to be resolved from support
