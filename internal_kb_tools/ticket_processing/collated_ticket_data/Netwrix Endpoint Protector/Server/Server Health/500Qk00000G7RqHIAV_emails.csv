Hi Dhanush,

A slot for 2:30 PM IST tomorrow was just made available after a client cancelled a scheduled session, can we schedule our session for this time tomorrow?  I'm afraid this is the earliest time that we can accommodate with a developer also joining in on the session.

Hi Dhanush,

Unfortunately I am not in office tomorrow.  I will first need to check internally the availability of our developer and also if one of my colleagues in the support team will be able to accommodate this time tomorrow before confirming with you.

Hi Dhanush,

I opened a case internally with our Dev team and requested them to provide us with SQL procedures which we can run on the live database to delete Unlicensed and Offline Computers from the backend.
I received an update earlier that our Dev team is currently looking into this, we will give you an update on this soon.

Hello Dhanush,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

This action can be done from the GUI by using the filters.  Apply a filter to show only ""Unlicensed"" and ""Offline"" computers, select all entries and then click on ""Delete"".



Please do let me know if you have any follow up questions or need any assistance.
