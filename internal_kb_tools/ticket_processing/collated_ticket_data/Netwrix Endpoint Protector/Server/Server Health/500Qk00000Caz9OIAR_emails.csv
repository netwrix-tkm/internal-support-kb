The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  *   When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  *   The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

We do not need approval for this. Our time zone is US Central. I would prefer to do this late in the afternoon like around 4 PM.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Hi Eduard,

We do not need approval for this. Our time zone is US Central. I would prefer to do this late in the afternoon like around 4 PM.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Thank you,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Eduard,

 

We do not need approval for this. Our time zone is US Central. I would prefer to do this late in the afternoon like around 4 PM.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Thank you,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Thank you,

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Joseph,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

That is a strange behavior and it should not happen, but once I get access I will check and let you know my findings.

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Thank you,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Hey Joseph,

Do you need to change anything in the console right now? I would like to hear back from engineering as I do not know how to prevent Mysql from stopping.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Joseph,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

That is a strange behavior and it should not happen, but once I get access I will check and let you know my findings.

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In that case can you please confirm the server version you are currently on so we can upgrade if needed, and after that I will mark for removal, all devices that do not have any rights set on them.

Thank you,

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

That is a strange behavior and it should not happen, but once I get access I will check and let you know my findings.

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

That is a strange behavior and it should not happen, but once I get access I will check and let you know my findings.

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Thank you,

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

 

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click ‘Devices’. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click ‘Devices’ and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

 

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

 

Here are the items I would like to discuss:

 


	When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
	The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the ‘Check Now’ button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.

Hi Eduard,

I wanted to check in and see how the cleanup was coming along.

I also wanted to confirm we are deploying the correct client version. Our server version was updated to 5.9.3.0, but the client version that is available for download is 6.2.2.1. Is this correct?

We have another urgent issue...all devices are currently being allowed. This means that anyone can plug in a flash drive and write to it.

Hi Joseph,

Let me know if it drops again. Until then I am removing duplicate devices. There are a lot of network printers to remove, around 12 million and this might cause some load so let me know if this is affecting the console access.

I can try rebooting again and once it's up quickly log in and change it before it crashes again.
Let me know if you want to try it or just wait for the server team.

Understood. I was trying to remove the duplicates and it seems the mysql service dropped.
Please allow me to send a reboot command to the server and you should be able to log in I will also let our server team know of what happened and will ask for their help here.
As an FYI, even if the server is not responding, the agents will still work as intended you just cannot edit or change rules.
Please let me know.

Hi Joseph,

In this case, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 and then I can perform the procedure.
Let me know if you need to have internal approval to upgrade or can you just upgrade when you can?
Once you have the approval let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session and I will set it up.

Hi Joseph,

After checking the server, the disk space looks great.
However, I noticed that there are a large number of devices, more specifically, duplicates created by the EPP server.
This might be the reason you cannot access the devices page. To solve this, we need to upgrade to 5.9.3.0 since it contains a fix for the device duplication issue, and after I can delete the duplicates from the server.
To best solve it, can you tell me if you are using any custom rights on any device?

Eduard,

It does appear that the disk space does actually fill up when we click 'Devices'. If we go to the Server Information section we can see that the system drive is at 28% capacity, but after we click 'Devices' and wait for a while it then goes up to 78% capacity.

You have my permission to access the database. Please let us know if you need anything else. I have added my colleague Steven Thomason to this email. Please reply to all going forward. Thank you.

Hi Joseph,

The disk space does not fill up when you just check the devices, but if there are a lot of them, you might see a long loading time. For this, I would like to check the number of devices in the database from the backend. To that end, can you allow me to ask for access from our server team and SSH into the server to check this?

As for the upgrade process, it is just as simple as clicking the check now, selecting the upgrade available, and then pressing apply updates. But as per the last notification from Netwrix, the vulnerability patch has been taken down for now as engineering has to apply another fix to it.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Thank you,

Eduard,

Here are the items I would like to discuss:


  1.  When you click on Device Control>>Devices the status just keeps spinning and nothing populates. If you let it spin long enough it starts to fill up the drive. We would like to be able to use this functionality.
  2.  The security advisory appears to suggest that we upgrade to version 5.9.3.0. We are currently running 5.8.1.0. Can you give us guidance on how to update our environment? Is it as simple as clicking the 'Check Now' button and applying any updates?

Hi Joseph,

The only relation between the low disk space banner and the devices menu is that if you have low disk space, some pages might load slower.
If you approve, I can ask for access to your back end and see what is taking up the disk space and remove some old patch files and older backup files that are not needed anymore.
As for the vulnerability patch, please send me your questions, and if I do not have the answer I will forward them to our engineering and get the answers.
