The disk space on the customer's server is full. After logging into the panel, the system logs the user out after 3 minutes.

Could we schedule a remote session to clean up unnecessary logs and increase the disk space? 
We're available tomorrow, either in the morning or between 1:00â€“2:00 PM (Turkey time), if that works for you.

Best Regards.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-20T13:50:14.000Z"
