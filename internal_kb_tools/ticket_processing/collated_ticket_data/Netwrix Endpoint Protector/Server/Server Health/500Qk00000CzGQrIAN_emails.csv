This issue might be realted to the EPP VM settings.
Please check and make sure that there are 2 Network cards attached to the VM and make sure that both of them are pointing to the same network.

Let me know if this would solve the issue.
Otherwise, we should schedule a remote session for Monday in order to investigate this further.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
you are right, the VM has only 1 NIC; adding the second one it works perfectly!

Thank you, have a great day.
