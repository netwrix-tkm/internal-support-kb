Betreff: RE: 00423637 - 11078 Network Printers and no other Devices shown in Device Control

 
Hello Jürgen,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00423637
Ticket Subject: 11078 Network Printers and no other Devices shown in Device Control
Ticket Details: On the Device Control Tab we have currently 11078 almost identical network printers and it shows no other devices. We do not have that amount of network printers. When searched for a specific device like devicetype ""bluetooth"" it correctly lists all available bluetooth devices.
Since there are so many identical network printers we have no real overlook over the devices. Also the appliance is still on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS. How can we upgrade the server?

Thank you!

Daniel Anton
Senior Technical Support Engineer
