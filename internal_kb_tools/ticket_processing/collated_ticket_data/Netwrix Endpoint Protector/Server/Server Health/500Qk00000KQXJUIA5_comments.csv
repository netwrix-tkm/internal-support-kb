Hi,


Please try to follow the next steps:

I. Check if tables are configured ok:

    Check the following value from the sysinfo table:
        SELECT * FROM sysinfo WHERE name = 'olog_epp_client_version';
    The returned value should be the same as the olog table field_4 position value.
         SHOW CREATE TABLE olog; (to check the fields from olog table)
    If the result from sysinfo is field_4, then the olog table should also present field_4.
    If the result from the sysinfo table is epp_client_version, in olog table, at the filed_4 position should be epp_client_version.
    If not, please update the sysinfo table:
        UPDATE sysinfo SET value = 'new_value' WHERE name = 'olog_epp_client_version';
            !!!  Replace new_value with the value from olog, from field_4 position

II. Apply the backend procedure:
     37. Audit Backup Debug Instructions

If these steps do not fix the issue , please provide some screenshots with the following information:

SHOW CREATE TABLE olog;
SHOW CREATE TABLE ofiletrace;
SHOW CREATE TABLE cf_log;

SELECT * FROM sysinfo WHERE name = ""olog_epp_client_version"";
SELECT * FROM sysinfo WHERE name = ""partitions_activated"";

SELECT count(*) FROM olog;
SELECT count(*) FROM ofiletrace;

Thank you.

Hi,

The audit_log_backup_status.png shows that all Audits have run successfully.

Can you please check if External Storage is enabled ? (System Maintenance - External Storage)

If it is enabled, search for the Audit file in the storage.

If it is not enabled, please send us this information:

   1. Enable debug for the Audit Log Backup


--- CODE ---
      touch /tmp/prepareAuditLogs.debug
      touch /var/log/epp/prepareAuditLogs.log
      chmod 777 /var/log/epp/prepareAuditLogs.log
--- CODE ---

      Start a new one time Audit backup and wait until it is finished
      Copy the /var/log/epp/prepareAuditLogs.log

      Very important: Remove debug log by running command:
                  rm /tmp/prepareAuditLogs.debug
   
    2. Execute query:
        SELECT * FROM parameter WHERE name = ""ex_storage_type"" OR name = ""sftp_ext_audit_log_backup"" OR name = ""ftp_ext_audit_log_backup"" OR name = ""ns_ext_audit_log_backup"" OR name = ""sftp_enable"" OR name = ""ftp_enable"" OR name = ""ns_enable"";


Thank you

Hi Iosif,


It appears that  ofiletrace table does not have partitions created, and I suspect  olog table may not have them either (as the olog.png does not display the full query result).

To provide accurate steps for creating partitions on these tables, we need to know the versions of MySQL and Ubuntu being used:

mysql -V
lsb_release -a


Please check all tables that should have partitions and try to make screenshots of the full query result:


SHOW CREATE TABLE olog;
SHOW CREATE TABLE ofiletrace;
SHOW CREATE TABLE cf_log;
SHOW CREATE TABLE cf_log_details;
SHOW CREATE TABLE dr_object;

Thank you

Hi Iosif,

Here are the steps to activate partitioning:

1. Make a system snapshot or a database backup
2. Copy script from  location smb://192.168.14.5/public/users/cilea/PARTITIONS/02-migrate.sql in the EPP backend in /home/epproot/ .


3. Run these commands to rename these files (in case they exist):


--- CODE ---
   mv /var/eppfiles/exports/export_olog.txt /var/eppfiles/exports/backup_export_olog.txt
   mv /var/eppfiles/exports/export_ofiletrace.txt /var/eppfiles/exports/backup_export_ofiletrace.txt
   mv /var/eppfiles/exports/export_cf_log.txt /var/eppfiles/exports/backup_export_cf_log.txt.txt
   mv /var/eppfiles/exports/export_capshadow.txt /var/eppfiles/exports/backup_export_capshadow.txt
   mv /var/eppfiles/exports/export_oshadow.txt /var/eppfiles/exports/backup_export_oshadow.txt
--- CODE ---

 

4. Activate the Base Partitions by running the mysql migration with the command:


--- CODE ---
   mysql -p eppdatabase < /home/epproot/02-migrate.sql
--- CODE ---

   This may take some time to execute depending on the number of logs.

5. Once the above script has finished running, execute the following mysql queries to verify the partitioning.

--- CODE ---
        show create table olog;
        show create table ofiletrace;
        show create table cf_log;
        show create table cf_log_details;
        show create table dr_object;
--- CODE ---

If the partitioning was a success, at the end of each query result you should see something like this:


--- CODE ---
         ....
         PARTITION `last` VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE ENGINE = InnoDB

--- CODE ---

6. Also check all log pages  and Audit:
      Reports and Analysis - Logs Report
      Reports and Analysis - File Tracing
      Reports and Analysis - Content Aware Report
      eDiscovery - Scan Results and Actions


7. Check if the partitions scripts exist in the crontab:


--- CODE ---
       crontab -e
--- CODE ---

  You should have these scripts:

     0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /opt/epptools/partitions.php -table=olog
     0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /opt/epptools/partitions.php -table=ofiletrace -clone=oshadow
     0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /opt/epptools/partitions.php -table=cf_log -clone=capshadow
     0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /opt/epptools/partitions.php -table=dr_object
      .....
     0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /opt/epptools/partitions.php -table=cf_log_details 2>/dev/null 2>&1

   If they are not present in the crontab please add them.

8. Remove script 02-migrate.sql from /home/epproot/

If you have any questions please let me know.

Regards,
Alina
