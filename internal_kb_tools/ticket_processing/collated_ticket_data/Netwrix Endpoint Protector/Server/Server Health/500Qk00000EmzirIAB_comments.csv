Please provide the following information: 

	 - 	MySQL version

	 - 	mysql -V
	 - 	check if partition are activated (partitions_activated flag is not enough ) 

	 - 	show create table cf_log;
	 - 	show create table olog;

Note: at the end of the table inforation the following info should be displayed:

| cf_log | CREATE TABLE `cf_log` (

.....

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci

/*!50100 PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp)

(PARTITION `last` VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE ENGINE = InnoDB) */ |


          3. review the log paths for each version to identify which patch the issue occurred in.


	 - 	vim /var/log/epp/update_HWA-EPP4-U00XX.txt (replace XX with the corresponding partition patch code.);

As a solution, if the customer has a snapshot available, revert the server to version 5.5.0.0. Afterward, apply each patch one at a time, checking the logs and UI after each application to ensure everything is functioning properly.

The upgrade is 

Depending on the MySQL version, it may not be possible to activate the partition. One possible solution is to use a new image. 

Or, to avoid all the above steps, try to convince the customer to use a new image.
