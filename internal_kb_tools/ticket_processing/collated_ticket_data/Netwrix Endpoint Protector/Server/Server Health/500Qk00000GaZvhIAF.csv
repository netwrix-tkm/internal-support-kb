"500Qk00000GaZvhIAF","00422836","Support Ticket","Inquiry about configuring SNMP monitoring for appliance","I would like to inquire whether it is possible to configure SNMP monitoring for our appliance. We need the appliance to send data about its status to our SNMP manager, where we can further process this information.

Specifically, I am interested in:

Whether the device supports SNMP (and which version of SNMP it supports).
If so, how and where we can configure this monitoring.
What data is available via SNMP (and if an MIB file is available for the device).
Whether it is possible to configure SNMP TRAPs to send alerts for important events.
Thank you in advance for your response and guidance.","","","","Info provided.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","NONE","","11.8","Closed - Resolved","T-Systems Slovakia","Jozef Fedak","2024-10-03T12:36:27.000Z","2024-10-15T06:52:53.000Z"
