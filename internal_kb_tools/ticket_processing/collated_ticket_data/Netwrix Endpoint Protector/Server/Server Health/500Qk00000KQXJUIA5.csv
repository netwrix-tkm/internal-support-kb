"500Qk00000KQXJUIA5","00431640","Support Ticket","Multiple Issues - Upgrade, Audit Log Backup, Logs Report Timing Out","Currently we have an EPP server that is having the following issues:
- When checking for a update it doesn't return the latest .1 that our other server can view. 
- The Logs Report page times out while loading and never results
- A manual Audit Log backup, even when setting for a 1 week retention, will run for 20 minutes and finish without producing a backup log which leads us to believe theres a process failing.","","We have had a remote session with the customer and collected the necessary information for raising an R&D escalation ticket.

We have received an answer from the R&D ticket and asked the customer for a new remote session to perform the suggested steps.

During our remote session, we were able to address the Log Reports page issue and now it loads properly.
The Audit Log Backup is still not working, we collected the requested info from R&D and will update the escalation ticket.

We have received more steps from R&D to debug the issue on the alert and asked the customer for a new remote session.

During our last remote session(6/2/2025) we collected the requested logs and query output for R&D to further investigate the Audit Log Backup issue.

During today's remote session(20/02/2025) we collected the MySQL and ubuntu versions along with the show create table for olog, ofiletrace, cf_log, cf_log_details, and dr_object. We have attached the screenshots to the sharepoint folder and commented on the R&D ticket.


R&D has provided the db script and the steps for creating the partitions, and we asked the customer for a new remote session.","We are waiting for a resolution from R&D.

We are waiting for the customer's answer on his availability for a new remote session this week.

A remote session has been scheduled for tomorrow 28.01.2025 12:00-13:00 MST.
