"500Qk00000HqVYzIAN","00425868","Support Ticket","Two Factor Authenticator does not work due to the incorrect server time","Hello,

Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that EPP admins cannot enter the console because the Two Factor Authenticator does not work due to the incorrect server time (time is forward for one minute).
Could you please make a remote session to correct the server time?","","","","The issue was that the customer hasn't allowed the pool.ntp.org (109.91.184.21) time server for the EPP appliance and therefor it can't sync correctly.
I have connected to the EPP backend and set up the time manually, remaining for them to allow the time server in their network.
Ticket will be closed with the customer's verbal confirmation.","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","2.3","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","Danylo Didenko","2024-11-04T07:27:07.000Z","2024-11-06T13:34:14.000Z"
