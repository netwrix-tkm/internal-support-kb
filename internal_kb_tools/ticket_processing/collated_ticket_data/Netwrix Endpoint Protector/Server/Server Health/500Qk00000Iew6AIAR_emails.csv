The server should be up now. Can you please try to log in to confirm you have access to it?
The issue seemed to be related to how the server was using the resources.
I have optimized the server to more efficiently use the available resources.

Can you also please confirm if the Client refresh time from ""Device Control > Global settings"" is at at least 300 second?

Kind regards
