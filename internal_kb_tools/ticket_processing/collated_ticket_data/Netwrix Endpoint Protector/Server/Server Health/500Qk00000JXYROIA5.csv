Customer name is PrivatBank.
They have installed a new EPP test server image and migrated all settings from production.
Can we please schedule the remote session to provide the optimization and clear all entries (Computers, Users, and groups) that left from the settings migration?
If possible, we might schedule it for 14:00 GMT+2 today.
Or if you are not available, we can schedule it for tomorrow or today later.","","","","f","","Daniel Anton","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Health","","","3.2","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-12-16T09:20:57.000Z","2024-12-19T14:02:43.000Z"
