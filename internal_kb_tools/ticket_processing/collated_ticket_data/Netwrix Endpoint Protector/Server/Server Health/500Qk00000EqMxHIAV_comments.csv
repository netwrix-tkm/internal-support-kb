Hey @Adrian Ivascu
When time allows, can you please have a look at the vulnerability list attached in the Attachments?
FYI @Krzysztof Staszalek, could we also double check these vulnerabilities against our internal list?
Thank you,
Cristi

@WaitingOnEngineer 
The list is confusing. Can you provide information which version of product/image were used for this vuln scan and if backed security fixes were applied prior the testing?

fyi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Adrian Ivascu

We really appreciate all the teams efforts in solving this case.
In order to be able to follow the company rules to close the ticket with status pending fix availability, we need to deliver to the customer an approximative quarter / version of EPP product for which we are aiming to introduce this fix. 
We would appreciate your efforts in this direction, as this will help both our teams in the common task in closing tickets /escalations .","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-05-19T11:56:21.000Z","2025-05-19T11:56:21.000Z","false","false"
