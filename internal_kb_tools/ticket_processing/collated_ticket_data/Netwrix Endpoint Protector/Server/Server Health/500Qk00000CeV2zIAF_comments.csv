Hi Support,
This seems to be natural behavior, especially now when current logs + old one processed after fixing vulnerability fix are processed.

On default view you see column ""Date/Time(Client)"" in chaotic order, but those logs are sorted out by ""Date/Time(Server)"" column not visible by default.
Please click on ""Show/Hide Column"" and enable ""Date/Time(Server)"", then you should be able see that this column has little purple arrow showing descent sorting. You can switch sorting to ""Client"" column and logs will be resorted.

Note1: If Server is still processing old logs - it will decrees performance of logs processing.
Note2: Sorting order option is not saved if admin leave this CAP report tab and will back to it later.
