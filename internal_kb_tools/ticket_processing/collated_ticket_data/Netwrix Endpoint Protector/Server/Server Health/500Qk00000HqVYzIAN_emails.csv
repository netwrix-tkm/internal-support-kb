I inquired about this matter and I received the information that this time server isn't being handled by the EPP appliance, it's an independend time server so you should research and see if that is the correct port.
I can share with you an unofficial list of other time servers as an example, that I found online:

Hello,
 

Sorry, I have an additional question regarding which port should customer allow for pool.ntp.org.

We found information that port UDP 123 should be allowed, is this correct?
Could you please confirm?
