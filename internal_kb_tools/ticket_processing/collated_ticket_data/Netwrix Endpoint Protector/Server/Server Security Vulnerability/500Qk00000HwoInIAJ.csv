Good day!
We have a customer that just did a VA on their side and observed the attached.
We have also checked with customer, they do not have a server certificate as of now.

We understand to resolve the vulnerability, they will need to paste the certificate information under ""Appliance > Maintenance> Server Certificate"".

However, in this case, how can we generate a CSR from the server in order to prepare the certificate ?

Thank you!
