"500Qk00000NoQetIAF","00441259","Support Ticket","Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS not longer Supportet","Hi,

our nessus scanner reportet that the OS on the EPP Appliance is Ubuntu 18.04.6 which is already EOL.

Since this is an Appliance we have no option to Upgrade the System.

Do you have any Whitepaper or other information that the System is still getting patched or how to Upgrade the Appliance to a Supported OS?

Kind regards
