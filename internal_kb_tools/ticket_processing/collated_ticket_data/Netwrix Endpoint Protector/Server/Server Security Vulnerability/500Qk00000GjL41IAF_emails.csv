Hello,


Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	
	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	
	make a VM snapshot
	
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have  the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:


	
	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	


If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????






After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,


Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	
	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	
	make a VM snapshot
	
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have  the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:


	
	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	


If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????






After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,


Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	
	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	
	make a VM snapshot
	
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have  the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:


	
	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	


If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????






After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer said that they've opened port 80 with IP 0.0.0.0, but seems like the issue is still there.
After update was applied, available update appears again.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping  keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,


Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Customer informed us that they already applied security update for EPP RST (test server) 5.9.4.0, but unfortunately the AWS scan results still show vulnerabilities.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	
	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	
	make a VM snapshot
	
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have  the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:


	
	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	


If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????






After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Dear Danylo,

On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	make a VM snapshot
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.
Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Inline image name : Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]

After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Dear Danylo,

On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	make a VM snapshot
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.
Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

	Security – this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)
	
	Other – this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database
	
	All Updates – this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates
	

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Inline image name : Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]

After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains. 
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Customer currently did not respond to the question regarding other machines on the AWS.
I will ask about their availability for the remote session.

Can we schedule another remote connection to run the ping keyserver.ubuntu.com command fro the Epp server?

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer said that they've opened port 80 with IP 0.0.0.0, but seems like the issue is still there.
After update was applied, available update appears again.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Once the safety steps mentioned above are done please make sure that you have the new 5.9.4.0 release  -  please go to Live Update menu, select one of the security updates type available and then click Check Updates:

  *   Security - this will update all security-related updates of installed packages (Critical and High)

  *   Other - this will download and apply any update available to 3rd party libraries, kernel, OS packages and MySQL database

  *   All Updates - this will download and apply Informational and Optional/Unclassi?ed updates

If there are updates available, click Apply Updates.

???????[Image_2024-10-10_17-40-29.png]





After you finished applying all the updates, please run the AWS scan to see what remains.
Could you please provide us update as soon as the OS security updates have been applied?  If you can share an approximate timeframe with us, we would be thankful.

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Customer currently did not respond to the question regarding other machines on the AWS.

I will ask about their availability for the remote session.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Customer said that they've opened port 80 with IP 0.0.0.0, but seems like the issue is still there.
After update was applied, available update appears again.

Dear Danylo,

On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

	test the updates in a test environment ?rst 
	
	make a VM snapshot
	 make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Dear Danylo,



On the new versions of Endpoint Protector it is possible now to apply Security updates directly from the User Interface, but before doing this we would like you to:

(Important!)To ensure the updates will not harm the system, following these actions:

  *   test the updates in a test environment ?rst

  *   make a VM snapshot

  *    make a system backup from the System Maintenance, the System Backup v2 section.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Customer applied security update, but after re-checking, available update appears again.
They applied the update several times, but the update is still shown there.
Should we connect and check?

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.


Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.

Perhaps after the security update was completed.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?


Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.


Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

So, after customer successfully rolled back, we need to schedule a remote session to try to apply the updates again, right?

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.

Perhaps after the security update was completed.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

After update was applied, available update appears again.

Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.
Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Customer said that they've opened port 80 with IP 0.0.0.0, but seems like the issue is still there.
After update was applied, available update appears again.

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Customer currently did not respond to the question regarding other machines on the AWS.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Customer said that they've opened port 80 with IP 0.0.0.0, but seems like the issue is still there.
After update was applied, available update appears again.

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.
Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

Hello,

It seems like most probably inbound traffic is not allowed.

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

Hello,

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Perhaps after the security update was completed.

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com>
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did this happen right after applying the update?
Was the server restarted?

Kind regards

Hello,

Customer reported that their test EPP server stopped working.

Perhaps after the security update was completed.
Can we please arrange a remote session ASAP?
The status is the CRITICAL now.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?
We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.
You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com>
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.
Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?

We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.

You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Kind regards

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

It seems like most probably inbound traffic is not allowed.

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.
You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com>
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.
Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

Hello,

It seems like most probably inbound traffic is not allowed.
I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:
It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?

We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.

You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hello,

Sure we can connect to check the server from the backend.
Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Kind regards

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?
We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.
You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com>
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Thank you for the update.
Maybe we can allow me to connect to the server again to check at a specific time like we did on Friday?

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

So, after customer successfully rolled back, we need to schedule a remote session to try to apply the updates again, right?

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?

We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.

You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Kind regards

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?
We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.
You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com>
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com<https://keyserver.ubuntu.com> over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.
Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

The same error seems to be present.
Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GjL41:ref

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.
So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.
""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""
What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.
Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.
Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.
Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.
I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.
Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.
Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?
Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?
Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?

Regarding the port 80.
Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.
Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.
But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.
We suggested them to re-install the test server.
Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Did we understand it correctly that you've experienced the same issue in your test environment?

We have a suggestion that this issue is not related to the customer's network configurations.

You can try to connect to our Demo environment as well to check if the issue also recreates here.

Hello,

Ok, then maybe there might still be something between the server and keyserver.ubuntu.com.
Because I also tried to telnet to keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 but it was not able to.

Kind regards

Hello,

While we're waiting for confirmation from the customer.

Did you try to use the 'keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' instead of just 'keyserver.ubuntu.com'?

I've asked if it possible to allow it right now.

Is it possible to confirm if the inbound rule covers port 80 or 443?

Hi,

Customer confirmed that they applied the recommendation to allow outbound traffic to keyserver.ubuntu.com.

Please let us know when we can schedule the remote session with the customer to try to apply the update from the backend.

Maybe we can try to allow only outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443.
And then have me connect to the backend again to try and apply the update from the backend.

Hello,

Thank you, I will ask to close the port.

So, customer should try to access to outbound keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 and try to apply an update?
Also, I'm a little wary because of previous update attempt, after customer opened full access to the internet, their test server down.

""Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.""

What would we do if this situation will appear again?

Hello,

Thank you for the access. It can be closed now.
The dev recommended trying and allowing access from the outbound rule to  keyserver.ubuntu.com over port 80 and 443 as the Epp server can't reach the keyserver.
Or you could try and allow all outbound connections until the update goes through.

Kind regards

Hello,

Not sure it's worth doing a remote connection just for that command.
Does the customer have other machines on the AWS to try and ping keyserver.ubuntu.com to see if resolves this FQDN resolves to an actual IP address?
If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

Kind regards

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.

Hello,

Please schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 11:00 GMT+3.

Customer also reported that this EPP instance is down every time when it gets full access to the internet and trying to receive updates.

Privat Bank team will roll back this server again before our remote session so we have a chance to provide a diagnostic.

Also attaching the screenshot of the server's connection attempts.

Hello,

The strange thing is that on Production server, security updates successfully applies.

I think we can coordinate the remote session with the customer to gather some logs and screenshots from the EPP backend for the PrivatBank team to show them why the update is not applying.

Perhaps after that they will find the way to open the connection between Ubuntu archive and EPP server.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
I am available tomorrow Friday between 8:00 and 13:00.

For the offline security update, it would be best to open a new ticket.

Maybe that is why the update did not go through when we allowed the port 80?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

They used the backup of test server; it turns out they have one.

Please let me know when do you have free timeslots to connect to the server?

Also, would like to know if it is possible to apply offline security patch, could you please clarify that?

Or should we open the separate ticket for this question?
 

Regarding the port 80.

Customer said that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by Privat's security policy.

Did the customer mention what they did to address this?

Hi,

We have the update from the customer again:

It seems like they have fixed the AWS issue and the server works now.

Can we schedule the remote session to provide the diagnostic of this test server just in case?

Hello,

Customer said that they do not have a backup for the test EPP server, they wanted to restore the test server using the backup from the Production EPP server.

But we informed them that these servers have a different Ubuntu version and this method will not work.

We suggested them to re-install the test server.

Or if it would be possible, we would be glad to schedule a meeting with the EPP team to help PrivatBank six this error on the AWS side.

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
I forwarded the screenshots internally.
We can either wait for an update or try to install the updates from the backend. We will need the snapshot in case there are issues.
