We are not aware of any clickjacking vulnerability on our server. The previous patch you mentioned was for the client exploit vulnerability, which if applied does not expire so it should not need a second apply, and since you are on 5.9.4.0 which eliminates that vulnerability, it cannot even be applied anymore.
Can you send the result that pointed to a clickjacking issue?

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

Here is a screenshot of the vulnerability detected by Nessus.  This is an
issue that has shown up over the years, usually after a server update and a
member of the Cososys team has remoted in and adjusted a couple of config
files to address the issue.

If you need any additional information please let me know.

What I think is that you are referring to the ancestors attribute in the headers of a config file.
Since I will need to have access to the backend, could you please let me know if EPP is hosted on your side in a VM or cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Google?
Also, please send me your timezone and availability for a remote session to apply it.

Hi Eduard,

We are hosting on a local VM at the moment.  Cristian Tornea was the one
who resolved the issue for us the last time back in 2020, but unfortunately
I don't have a ticket number to provide you.

We're in the Eastern U.S. time zone, and any time between 9 AM and 5 PM
works for us.

Thanks,

Hi Mark,

I set the meeting for today at 1 PM EST. If your company restricts remote access through Teams, we will find alternatives.
Please make sure we have ssh access to the appliance.

Hi Eduard, 

 

We are hosting on a local VM at the moment.  Cristian Tornea was the one who resolved the issue for us the last time back in 2020, but unfortunately I don't have a ticket number to provide you. 

 

We're in the Eastern U.S. time zone, and any time between 9 AM and 5 PM works for us. 

 

Thanks,

Mark

Hey Mark,

What I think is that you are referring to the ancestors attribute in the headers of a config file.
Since I will need to have access to the backend, could you please let me know if EPP is hosted on your side in a VM or cloud service like AWS, Azure, or Google?
Also, please send me your timezone and availability for a remote session to apply it.

Hi Eduard,

 

Here is a screenshot of the vulnerability detected by Nessus.  This is an issue that has shown up over the years, usually after a server update and a member of the Cososys team has remoted in and adjusted a couple of config files to address the issue.

 



 

If you need any additional information please let me know.

 

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Mark,

We are not aware of any clickjacking vulnerability on our server. The previous patch you mentioned was for the client exploit vulnerability, which if applied does not expire so it should not need a second apply, and since you are on 5.9.4.0 which eliminates that vulnerability, it cannot even be applied anymore.
Can you send the result that pointed to a clickjacking issue?

Thank you,

It might be a good idea to have a recent snapshot of the VM, so can you please make sure to have one by tomorrow?

Hi Mark,

I set the meeting for today at 1 PM EST. If your company restricts remote access through Teams, we will find alternatives.
Please make sure we have ssh access to the appliance.

Hi Eduard, 

 

We are hosting on a local VM at the moment.  Cristian Tornea was the one who resolved the issue for us the last time back in 2020, but unfortunately I don't have a ticket number to provide you. 

 

We're in the Eastern U.S. time zone, and any time between 9 AM and 5 PM works for us. 

 

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Eduard,

 

Here is a screenshot of the vulnerability detected by Nessus.  This is an issue that has shown up over the years, usually after a server update and a member of the Cososys team has remoted in and adjusted a couple of config files to address the issue.

 



 

If you need any additional information please let me know.

 

Thanks,

Mark

The previous patch you mentioned was for the client exploit vulnerability, which if applied does not expire so it should not need a second apply, and since you are on 5.9.4.0 which eliminates that vulnerability, it cannot even be applied anymore.
Can you send the result that pointed to a clickjacking issue?

We have worked with the team to patch an issue that our vulnerability scanner is returning for the EPP server - it is vulnerable to clickjacking. Would somebody be available today or early tomorrow to apply the clickjacking patch again for us?

Thanks,
