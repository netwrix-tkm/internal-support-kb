As per the latest notification, Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.

So I would suggest waiting a couple of days until they make the revised hotfix available since currently is offline, and then we can apply it.

Let me know if that works for you.

Thankyou,
Eduard Nut

Hello Eduard.

 

Seems they just released.   I’m in the process of making sure we have a snapshot before we take the next steps.

 

Can we schedule a session on Monday to do the update with your assistance?

 

Currently available from 9-11:30am and 1-3PM PDT.

 

Please let me know.

 

Thanks,

Guill

Hi Guill,

That sounds good. Once it is available, just let me know and we will set up a remote session to apply it. Before we do that, please make sure you have a snapshot created right before the meeing.

Hi Guill,

As per the latest notification, Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.

So I would suggest waiting a couple of days until they make the revised hotfix available since currently is offline, and then we can apply it.

Let me know if that works for you.

Thankyou,
Eduard Nut
Technical Support Engineer
