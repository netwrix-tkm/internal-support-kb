Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:

	We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
	We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
	The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 

As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref



Hello André,

 

I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.

Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.

 

Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.

We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 

 

I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.

 

** Who is KISA?

""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 

 

** Who is the customer

This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.



 

In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 

This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 

 

 

​ ​** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.

 

""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”

 

​** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.

First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.

 

​**Who is NIS?

""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.


Key Roles:


	Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
	National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
	Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
	Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  



KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)


 

  

 

KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.

 

 

KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.

So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.

 



 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php


 

 

 

 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.

 


#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure

The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 

After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.

 

[Note]

You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:

https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs

 

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs

 

 

#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server

Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).

 

#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server

Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.

 

For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.

https://EPP-IP/1

https://EPP-IP/wstats

https://EPP-IP/wsdocs

and so on.

 

#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login

1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 

My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 

I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.

 

Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Dear André,

 

Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.

KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 

NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.

So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.

 

In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.

This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.

 

What is your opinion on this cutomization request?

 

** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.

 

Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Hello Support Team,

 

KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.

 

We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.

 

Thanks!

Hi Andre,

 

 

Thank you for your fast update.

 

We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team. 

This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.

 

Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?

 

We look forward to your positive response. 

Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Hello Jack,

I would like to provide you with an update and relay feedback.

Our Security team gave the below responses on the vulnerabilities being raised, please see below.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.



Kind regards

Hi Paul,

 

 

 

I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.

 

We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543. 

Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.

 

Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.

 

Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.

 

Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution. 

For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.

 

It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service. 

I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.

 

Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.

 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:

  1.  We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
  2.  We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
  3.  The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.



As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref

Hello André,

I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.
Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.

Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.
We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI).

I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.

** Who is KISA?
""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles:

** Who is the customer
This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.
[image.png]

In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be.
This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP.


? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.

""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”

?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.
First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.

?**Who is NIS?
""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.

Key Roles:

  *   Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
  *   National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
  *   Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
  *   Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""


KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

  [Image]

KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.


KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool,
 https://EPP-IP/client.php<https://epp-ip/client.php> <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.
So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.

[Image]

 https://EPP-IP/client.php<https://epp-ip/client.php>



 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.


#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure

The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements.

After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js<https://epp-ip/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js>)  must not reveal any content.



[Note]

You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:

https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs



Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs





#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server

Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt<https://epp-ip/robots.txt>).



#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server

Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.



For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.

https://EPP-IP/1<https://epp-ip/1>

https://EPP-IP/wstats<https://epp-ip/wstats>

https://EPP-IP/wsdocs<https://epp-ip/wsdocs>

and so on.



#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login

1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt<https://epp-ip/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt>
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php<https://epp-ip/client.php>
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case.
My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS.
I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.

Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Subject: (Important) RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #430543 - Request for Fixing Vulnerabilities Identified During NIS Audit [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Johzj:ref ]

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref

Dear André,

Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.
KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation.
NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.
So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.

In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.
This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.

What is your opinion on this cutomization request?

** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.

Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack, Gabriel

I hope you are well.

I wanted to follow up on this case since the last feedback that we provided on 30th January.  Did the customer give a response, provide any feedback or raise follow up questions?
Kindly let us know the current status for this case and if we may proceed to close it.


Kind regards

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Hello Support Team,

KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.

We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.

Thanks!

Hi Andre,


Thank you for your fast update.

We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team.
This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.

Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?

We look forward to your positive response.
Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.


Best Regards,
Jack Jung

Hi Paul,



I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.

We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543.
Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.

Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.

Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.

Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution.
For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.

It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service.
I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.

Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Have a nice day!

Jack Jung

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:

	We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
	We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
	The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 

As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

Hello André,

 

I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.

Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.

 

Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.

We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 

 

I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.

 

** Who is KISA?

""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 

 

** Who is the customer

This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.



 

In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 

This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 

 

 

? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.

 

""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”

 

?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.

First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.

 

?**Who is NIS?

""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.


Key Roles:


	Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
	National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
	Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
	Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  



KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)


 

  

 

KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.

 

 

KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.

So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.

 



 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php


 

 

 

 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.

 


#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure

The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 

After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.

 

[Note]

You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:

https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs

 

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs

 

 

#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server

Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).

 

#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server

Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.

 

For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.

https://EPP-IP/1

https://EPP-IP/wstats

https://EPP-IP/wsdocs

and so on.

 

#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login

1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 

My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 

I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.

 

Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Dear André,

 

Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.

KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 

NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.

So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.

 

In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.

This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.

 

What is your opinion on this cutomization request?

 

** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.

 

Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Hello Support Team,

 

KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.

 

We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.

 

Thanks!

Hi Andre,

 

 

Thank you for your fast update.

 

We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team. 

This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.

 

Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?

 

We look forward to your positive response. 

Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Hello Jack,

I would like to provide you with an update and relay feedback.

Our Security team gave the below responses on the vulnerabilities being raised, please see below.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.



Kind regards

Hi Paul,

 

 

 

I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.

 

We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543. 

Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.

 

Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.

 

Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.

 

Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution. 

For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.

 

It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service. 

I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.

 

Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.

 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:
We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 
As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref
 
Hello André,
 
I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.
Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.
 
Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.
We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 
 
I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.
 
** Who is KISA?
""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 
 
** Who is the customer
This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.
 
In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 
This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 
 
 
? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.
 
""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”
 
?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.
First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.
 
?**Who is NIS?
""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.
Key Roles:

Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
 
  
 
KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.
 
 
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.
So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.
 
 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php
 
 
 
 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.
 
#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 
After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.
 
[Note]
You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:
https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs
 
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs
 
 
#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).
 
#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.
 
For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.
https://EPP-IP/1
https://EPP-IP/wstats
https://EPP-IP/wsdocs
and so on.
 
#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 
My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 
I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.
 
Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.



Kind regards

Dear André,
 
Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.
KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 
NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.
So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.
 
In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.
This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.
 
What is your opinion on this cutomization request?
 
** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.
 
Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.


Kind regards

Hello Support Team,
 
KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.
 
We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.
 
Thanks!

Hi Andre,
 
 
Thank you for your fast update.
 
We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team.
This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.
 
Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?
 
We look forward to your positive response.
Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Jack Jung

Hi Paul,
 
 
 
I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.
 
We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543.
Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.
 
Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.
 
Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.
 
Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution.
For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.
 
It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service.
I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.
 
Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:

	We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
	We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
	The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 

As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

Hello André,

 

I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.

Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.

 

Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.

We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 

 

I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.

 

** Who is KISA?

""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 

 

** Who is the customer

This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.



 

In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 

This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 

 

 

? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.

 

""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”

 

?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.

First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.

 

?**Who is NIS?

""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.


Key Roles:


	Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
	National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
	Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
	Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  



KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)


 

  

 

KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.

 

 

KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.

So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.

 



 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php


 

 

 

 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.

 


#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure

The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 

After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.

 

[Note]

You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:

https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs

 

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs

 

 

#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server

Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).

 

#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server

Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.

 

For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.

https://EPP-IP/1

https://EPP-IP/wstats

https://EPP-IP/wsdocs

and so on.

 

#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login

1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 

My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 

I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.

 

Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Dear André,

 

Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.

KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 

NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.

So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.

 

In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.

This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.

 

What is your opinion on this cutomization request?

 

** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.

 

Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Hello Support Team,

 

KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.

 

We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.

 

Thanks!

Hi Andre,

 

 

Thank you for your fast update.

 

We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team. 

This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.

 

Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?

 

We look forward to your positive response. 

Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Hello Jack,

I would like to provide you with an update and relay feedback.

Our Security team gave the below responses on the vulnerabilities being raised, please see below.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.



Kind regards

Hi Paul,

 

 

 

I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.

 

We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543. 

Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.

 

Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.

 

Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.

 

Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution. 

For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.

 

It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service. 

I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.

 

Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.

 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Hi, André

I have discussed these 3 conculsions with KOSPO. They accpted 2 conculsions and 1 leave it as is.

We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect. --> Accpeted 
We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure --> Levae it as is. I was convinced that this modification could potentially cause problems and decided to stick with it as is.
The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product. --> Accpeted, They will wait 5.9.4.2. offline pacth 


Thank you so much for all your hard work.

Best
Jay

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:
We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 
As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref
 
Hello André,
 
I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.
Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.
 
Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.
We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 
 
I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.
 
** Who is KISA?
""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 
 
** Who is the customer
This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.
 
In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 
This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 
 
 
? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.
 
""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”
 
?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.
First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.
 
?**Who is NIS?
""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.
Key Roles:

Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
 
  
 
KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.
 
 
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.
So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.
 
 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php
 
 
 
 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.
 
#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 
After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.
 
[Note]
You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:
https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs
 
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs
 
 
#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).
 
#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.
 
For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.
https://EPP-IP/1
https://EPP-IP/wstats
https://EPP-IP/wsdocs
and so on.
 
#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 
My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 
I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.
 
Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Dear André,
 
Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.
KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 
NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.
So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.
 
In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.
This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.
 
What is your opinion on this cutomization request?
 
** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.
 
Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.


Kind regards

Hello Support Team,
 
KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.
 
We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.
 
Thanks!

Hi Andre,
 
 
Thank you for your fast update.
 
We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team.
This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.
 
Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?
 
We look forward to your positive response.
Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Jack Jung

Hi Paul,
 
 
 
I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.
 
We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543.
Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.
 
Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.
 
Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.
 
Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution.
For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.
 
It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service.
I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.
 
Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Hi, André

 

I have discussed these 3 conculsions with KOSPO. They accpted 2 conculsions and 1 leave it as is.

We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect. --> Accpeted We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure --> Levae it as is. I was convinced that this modification could potentially cause problems and decided to stick with it as is.
	The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product. --> Accpeted, They will wait 5.9.4.2. offline pacth 
	

Thank you so much for all your hard work.

 

Best

Jay

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:
We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedureThe out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.
 

As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

Hello André,

 

I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.

Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.

 

Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.

We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 

 

I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.

 

** Who is KISA?

""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 

 

** Who is the customer

This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.

[Inline image name : image.png]

 

In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 

This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 

 

 

? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.

 

""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”

 

?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.

First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.

 

?**Who is NIS?

""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.

Key Roles:

Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""
  

KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

 

  [Inline image name : img-b75d3ad3-91b9-445d-8c11-ea01df5ef403]

 

KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.

 

 

KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)

This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.

So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.

 

[Inline image name : img-a0bf4401-5925-4b5e-ab1b-e55df0c227c7]

 

 https://EPP-IP/client.php

 

 

 

 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.

 

#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure

The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 

After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.

 

[Note]

You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:

https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs

 

Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs

 

 

#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server

Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).

 

#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server

Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.

 

For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.

https://EPP-IP/1

https://EPP-IP/wstats

https://EPP-IP/wsdocs

and so on.

 

#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login

1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 

My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 

I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.

 

Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

Kind regards

Dear André,

 

Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.

KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 

NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.

So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.

 

In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.

This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.

 

What is your opinion on this cutomization request?

 

** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.

 

Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Kind regards

Hello Support Team,

 

KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.

 

We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.

 

Thanks!

Hi Andre,

 

 

Thank you for your fast update.

 

We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team. 

This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.

 

Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?

 

We look forward to your positive response. 

Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Hello Jack,

I would like to provide you with an update and relay feedback.

Our Security team gave the below responses on the vulnerabilities being raised, please see below.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.

Kind regards

Hi Paul,

 

 

 

I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.

 

We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543. 

Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.

 

Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.

 

Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.

 

Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution. 

For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.

 

It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service. 

I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.

 

Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.

 

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best Regards,

Hi, André
 
I have discussed these 3 conculsions with KOSPO. They accpted 2 conculsions and 1 leave it as is.

We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect. --> Accpeted 
We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure --> Levae it as is. I was convinced that this modification could potentially cause problems and decided to stick with it as is.
The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product. --> Accpeted, They will wait 5.9.4.2. offline pacth 


Thank you so much for all your hard work.
 
Best
Jay

Dear Gabriel,

Long time no speak, hope you are doing fine! :)

I am writing you on this case after we had another internal meeting with the Security team in order to be sure that we collected all the required data and to check that we've did everything that is possible to help for the reported situation with KOSPO.
We also wanted to make sure that we treated this much more like a customization request as highlighted by you and not like a vulnerability report.

I am sending you below the conclusion we have reached after checking again with the Security team:
We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect.
We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure
The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product.

 
As previously noted, the first two items are considered unsupported customizations. While the removal of client.php and robots.txt has no anticipated impact, it is possible that the second item could cause unanticipated problems.
As we cannot predict what this could cause, Support for any problem attributed to this will not be provided.

We really hope that this could bring some help regarding the NIS Audit for KOSPO.

PS: please let us know if the attachment with the procedure was by any chance blocked so that we can try to send it in another way.

Hello André,
 
I’adding our partner on this email thread and Michelle, she is in charge of Korea business.
Jay Kwon (Jay.Kwon@viccns.com) will be your contact for solving this issue and to contact the customer.
 
Regarding your request , the raw scan results of the NIS Audit has been delivered to you from Jack.
We do not know what tools was used and what is the real outcome from it. NIS made it and never explain about it but we can guess by using other vulnerability check tools. In addition, this is not only the result of the tool. KISA’s guideline book (over 800 pages long we do not have this too) has dedicated pages what to do with Web server (EPP is using it as UI). 
 
I will list up the details of the result and what to do for the EPP server of this customer.
 
** Who is KISA?
""The Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) is an organization responsible for promoting internet development and protecting information in South Korea. As a quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Science and ICT, it performs the following key roles: 
 
** Who is the customer
This customer is ""Korea Southern Power Co., Ltd” that is powering 2nd largest city of Korea, Pusan City.
And using 3600 clients of EPP since Y2015.
 
In fact, the development team can fix this small customization issue in one hour but it is taking too long time to be. 
This issue is getting bigger and noisy now. KISA, NIS, the customer are working together to figure out the solution that is including to remove Endpoint Protector and move to other vendor’s DLP. 
 
 
? ?** SCADA network is an isolated network not connected to internet. SCDA is working for the core infrastructure of Korea nation.
 
""South Korea's SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks play an essential role in the efficient operation and management of national critical infrastructure. SCADA systems support the stable operation of social infrastructure by enabling real-time data collection, monitoring, and control across various sectors, including power, water, gas, and transportation.”
 
?** KISA’s guidebook for EPP issue that is the result of auditing by NIS.
First, this list is NOT BUGs nor vulnerability at all. This is compliance issue and our customer wants to comply the order of NIS.
 
?**Who is NIS?
""The NIS in South Korea refers to the National Intelligence Service. The National Intelligence Service is a core intelligence agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information to ensure South Korea's national security.
Key Roles:

Overseas Intelligence and Domestic Security Intelligence Collection: Identifying elements that threaten national security through overseas intelligence activities, and monitoring activities that threaten national security by collecting domestic security information.
National Security-Related Information Analysis and Evaluation: Comprehensively analyzing and evaluating collected information to assess its impact on national security, and providing information necessary for policy decisions.
Counter-Terrorism, Counter-Espionage, and North Korea Operations: Responding to domestic and foreign terrorist threats, detecting espionage activities by foreign intelligence agencies, and conducting North Korea operations to strengthen national security.
Cybersecurity-Related Activities: Conducting national cybersecurity-related activities, and collecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threat information.""

  
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
 
  
 
KISA’s guide is saying Web server’s errors such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 must redirected to a specific page so that do not allow these errors are providing any internal information to external random accesses.
 
 
KISA Technical Vulnerability Remediation Guide for Critical Infrastructure (SCADA)
This page is talking about to expose not necessary internal information. According to the result of the tool, 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php <- This makes anyone can see unusal client download page of EPP, and this page is the expose case.
So that, this page needs to be hidden or removed.
 
 
 https://EPP-IP/client.php
 
 
 
 Here is summary of all requests from the customer. I think you have received from Jack.
 
#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. 
After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)  must not reveal any content.
 
[Note]
You can download the ‘Burp Suite Community Edition’ tool below:
https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2024-10-3?requestededition=community&requestedplatform=
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 6sec) for checking #1 issue:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DYQ6_xe6FpEQxRosx3YAJCuOrvLQF2zr&usp=drive_fs
 
Please kindly refer to the video clip (1min 51sec) for checking #2, #3, #4 issues:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D_ZXx8QBL6281f-Gfv-6jxQw-exI7DpE&usp=drive_fs
 
 
#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
Please remove the robots.txt file (https://EPP-IP/robots.txt).
 
#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.
 
For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.
https://EPP-IP/1
https://EPP-IP/wstats
https://EPP-IP/wsdocs
and so on.
 
#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
1) https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt
2) https://EPP-IP/client.php
Please both above pages must be removed.

Please work with Jay Kwon, he will work with you to complete this case. 
My concern is (1)we are late to fix this issue (2)we will lose not only this customer but also other customer who are part of SCADA of Korea nation. they are all linked and under direct control of NIS. 
I’m sure the development team can fix this issue in one hour. Jay Kwon can make the customer will allow to get this unit outside of the SCADA network. So that, support team can do a remote access into this unit, a KA2000 HW EPP appliance.
 
Many thanks!!!

Dear Gabriel, Jack

I would like to relay to you feedback from our Security team.

Our position will remain unchanged to what we have communicated previously.  The requested customizations will break the application and cannot be made. You may remove the robots.txt and client.php files which resolves two of the issues but these actions are unsupported by Netwrix, Netwrix will not provide support for any issues that may stem from those actions.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref
 
Dear André,
 
Sorry for late reply. This request was NOT VULNERABILITY report but it was CUSTOMIZATION request.
KOSPO is an organization of Korea Gov. so the customer must comply Korea Gov’s regulation. 
NIS (National Intelligent Service = same as CIA in the US) audited KOSPO’s IT implementation and EPP was failed to comply.
So, KOSPO reported the failure to comply with EPP.
 
In order to support KOSPO to pass the audit process, I had Jack to make come changes on the EPP appliance at KOSPO.
This change request is only for KOSPO’s EPP appliance only. All soide effects are NOT issues here but they have EPP appliance must pass thru NIS audit.
 
What is your opinion on this cutomization request?
 
** please consider this, we do nothing then the customer will dump EPP and will move to our competitor’s DLP solution even though EPP is the best for the customer.
 
Thanks a lot!!

Dear Jack,

Our Security team provided additional feedback in response to the request of modifications to the KOSPO server.  Please see below in red the recent feedback.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.
Regarding jquery – while the requested remediation actions are impossible, we believe that this finding relates to the use of an out-of-date version of jquery. This library will be updated in the next Endpoint Protector release, which is planned in the next few months.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.
Regarding robots.txt and client.php -- we do not recommend removing these files from the server as they are not security concerns. Additionally, if the server is exposed to the internet, removing robots.txt may cause it to be indexed by search engines and make it easier for attackers to discover. However, if the client persists, the partner may work with them to remove them. As this would be done against our recommendation, should any issues arise a result of this, Netwrix will not provide support for any issue deemed by us to be a result of these actions.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.
Regarding the HTTP error page – there is no action that can be taken that would not potentially break the application. Again, they are asking to modify the way the HTTP protocol is intended to behave.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.

Hello Support Team,
 
KSEL certificate release was for certification only. So, many features and UIs were removed or hidden.
 
We are selling normal EPP release only for Korea customers but “Legacy Licenses”.
 
Thanks!

Hi Andre,
 
 
Thank you for your fast update.
 
We fully understand the feedback provided by the Security team.
This request is not intended to implement these changes across the entire EPP but rather to make specific modifications to the server in question to assist our customer, KOSPO, in successfully passing this audit from NIS(National Intelligence Service). We would not have made this kind of request if it were for other customers.
 
Could you please apply the requested modifications only to the KOSPO server?
 
We look forward to your positive response.
Once again, thank you for your continuous support and assistance.

Hi Paul,
 
 
 
I am reaching out to you via your previous email address as I am unaware of the updated Netwrix email. I hope this message reaches you successfully.
 
We are working closely with the support team to resolve Ticket# 00430543.
Although the Netwrix support team is doing their best within the scope of their capabilities, I am writing to you due to the critical nature of this issue.
 
Our customer, Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO), is a highly significant institution for our DLP (Data Loss Prevention) sales and marketing strategy in South Korea. As one of the key public institutions responsible for the nation’s energy supply, KOSPO plays a pivotal role in the energy sector.
 
Having public institutions like KOSPO as a customer serves as a powerful reference in the cybersecurity solutions market. Public institutions are particularly sensitive to security and regulatory compliance, and KOSPO’s choice to adopt and continuously use a specific DLP solution demonstrates the reliability and stability of the product. This credibility extends beyond public institutions to private energy companies and large-scale infrastructure corporations, creating additional market opportunities. For this reason, even the National Intelligence Service prioritizes vulnerability assessments for core public institutions like KOSPO.
 
Currently, KOSPO is under significant pressure from the National Intelligence Service, which has escalated their urgency for resolution.
For nearly a month, the customer has been calling twice daily to inquire about when support for this issue will be available.
 
It is crucial to provide the client with a realistic timeline for resolving this issue to alleviate the huge pressure from the National Intelligence Service.
I understand that the beginning of the year is a busy period, but I kindly request your assistance in sharing a feasible schedule for support.
 
Please note that the Lunar New Year holiday in South Korea falls between January 27th and January 31st, so we would appreciate scheduling support outside of this period.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Have a nice day!

Jack Jung

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #430543 - Request for Fixing Vulnerabilities Identified During NIS Audit

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Johzj:ref

Hi Andre,



Thank you for your email and for escalating this case internally.
Now our customer is pushing very strongly for this issue everyday.

Additionally, as the last week of January coincides with the Lunar New Year holidays, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know whether it’s possible to provide an update before then. If resolving this case will require more time, please let me know if we can arrange a remote conference to discuss it further with your team.


Have a nice day!
Thank you for your understanding and support.



Best Regards,
Jack??! ?? ??? ???? ?? ????.","RE: (Important) RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #430543 - Request for Fixing Vulnerabilities Identified During NIS Audit [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Johzj:ref ]","jay.kwon@viccns.com","권수일","techsupport@netwrix.com","paul.marcu@netwrix.com; michelle.klich@netwrix.com; support@cososys.kr; gabriel@2astra.co; ivycaple@viccns.com","","true","2025-03-25T09:24:40.000Z","true"
