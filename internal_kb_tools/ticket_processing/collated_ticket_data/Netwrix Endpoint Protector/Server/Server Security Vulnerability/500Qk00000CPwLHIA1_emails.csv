Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.

I inquired internally about this specific scenario and would like to update you on this:

If before moving the appliance in an airgapped network the customer did not filled in the preliminary step with the Administrator fields details and sent the request, he will not have access to the View Applied Patches button /menu.
The only way would be for me to check in the backend of the server but for that you would need access to that network and for us to have a remote session.

Hello Alin,

Customer says he doesn't see this button on Live update page, maybe because it is on-prem airgapped server?

Hello,

I inquired internally about this specific scenario and would like to update you on this:

If before moving the appliance in an airgapped network the customer did not filled in the preliminary step with the Administrator fields details and sent the request, he will not have access to the View Applied Patches button /menu.
The only way would be for me to check in the backend of the server but for that you would need access to that network and for us to have a remote session.

Thank you for the update. However it didn’t answer my question, if customer can somehow check, if the hotfix was applied or not.

What is the ETA for new hotfix please?

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
