"500Qk00000MNAQEIA5","00437239","Support Ticket","Neoway - Request for HTTP Header Implementation","Hello Team, as asked,
Opening the ticket to continuate this point:

The customer replied:

They are ok with the strict-transport-security alteration.

About the ""Content-Security-Policy"" alteration, they are fundamental to them. They suggested changing to something like Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only so it won't interfere in the EPP UI.
Adding to that, the frame-ancestors 'none' needs to be added to the ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only"". Thats the main point for them to close this.

Let me know if the alterations are possible.

Best regards,","","4/4/2025
