Our EPP server is currently getting scanned by Tenable for vulnerabilities. There are currently 253 vulnerabilities, obviously only a few of them being critical. Would I need someone from your team to support in patching these? Or would the secondary root account that was created by you for us to use have the appropriate permissions to so?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-13T12:48:19.000Z"

If they didn't yet, I asked them to do this as soon as possible and then to run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-14T15:09:19.000Z"
