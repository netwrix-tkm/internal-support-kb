Hello David,

Following up on Christian's email, I'm writing to schedule the session for
the configuration and System Backup V2 migration.

Do you have any availability this week to perform the change, or would it
be better to aim for sometime next week? Please let me know what works best
for you.

Hello Philipp,


Sure, we can schedule it for Thursday. Please provide me 1-2 timeframes when this would be suitable for you.
@Cristian, regarding the following question: ""we have the 5.9.4.1 installed, since this is only i minor fix Im not sure if this will have any Impact"" - we will apply one patch to reach 5941 on the new appliance and then do the Backup Import.

Hello David,

 

Following up on Christian's email, I'm writing to schedule the session for the configuration and System Backup V2 migration.

 

Do you have any availability this week to perform the change, or would it be better to aim for sometime next week? Please let me know what works best for you.
kind regards,

Dear Christian,

Please find below the virtual appliance image sitting on Ubuntu 22:

Please download it and import it so afterwards we can schedule a session for the configuration and the System Backup V2 migration.
Looking forward for your reply.
