SKT, leading telecom provider in Korea, has been hacked.

Forensic analysis confirmed that malicious files caused the issue.

Could you check if these files exist in the EPP Server?
(We have the hash values.)

Our customer is also affiliated with SKT.

We will likely need your remote support for this.

Thank you.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-08T00:31:26.000Z"
