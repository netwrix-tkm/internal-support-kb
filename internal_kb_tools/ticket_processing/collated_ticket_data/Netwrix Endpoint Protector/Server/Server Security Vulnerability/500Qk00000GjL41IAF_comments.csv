Hi @Andrei Pop


Please confirm if:



--- CODE ---ping keyserver.ubuntu.com
--- CODE ---

resolves this FQDN to an actual IP address, like:



--- CODE ---$ ping keyserver.ubuntu.com
PING keyserver.ubuntu.com (185.125.188.27) 56(84) bytes of data.
--- CODE ---



If it does not resolve to *ANY* IP address, then you have a DNS issue that needs fixing.

As for server error.zip, I don't see it attached to this ticket and thus am not able to access it.

@WaitingOnEngineer

@Andrei Pop , please note down the output of the ping command I mentioned earlier.

Looking at the screenshots, I lack information from you on why you ran ""pgp --keyserver pgp.mit.edu [..]"" as well as why you ran ""wget mysql.com"" and ""wget google.com"" and ""telnet mysql.com 443"". What were you precisely trying to achieve ?

In regards to the kernel log, when did those error messages appear inside it ?
