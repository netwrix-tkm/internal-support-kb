Hello,

I successfully downloaded updated EPP clients.
But customer has an issue with latest EPP Ubuntu 22 client.
Currently Ubuntu 22 v2.4.2.1 is installed on their endpoints and the latest Ubuntu client has version 2.4.2.1007, but in the console they above looks like v2.4.2.1 that's why Computers in EPP console are duplicating after clients were updated.
Could you please increase the EPP client version, for example to v2.4.2.2?


Best regards,
