"500Qk00000FzO1dIAF","00421551","Support Ticket","Several security findings found on AWS hosted EPP server; no available updates found on dashboard","We have implemented Wiz which looks at security vulnerabilities on our AWS hosts.  The EPP server we have hosted is showing critical vulnerability (openSSH regreSSHion) that we need addressed.  Recommended action is: The vulnerability can be remediated by updating the package to version 1:8.9p1-3ubuntu0.10 or higher, using apt upgrade openssh-sftp-server.

I did not want to update via the dashboard, as the last time this was attempted, the server became unbootable.","","","","applied backend security updates regarding the OpenSSH vulenrability","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","","61.1","Closed - Resolved","Sharecare","Taylor Summers","2024-09-19T15:38:22.000Z","2024-11-19T17:07:31.000Z"
