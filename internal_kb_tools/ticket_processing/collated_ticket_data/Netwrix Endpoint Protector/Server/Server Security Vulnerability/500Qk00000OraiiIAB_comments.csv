Hi Flaviu,

I hope you are well.

It seems that this CVE impacts Ubuntu 22 version2.11.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.2, however, it was fixed on Ubuntu 22 version2.11.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.3 - this information can be found on Ubuntu's official website: https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-27363


Our recommendation for the customer is to apply the security fixes found in the later version (Ubuntu 22 version2.11.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.3) and then re-evaluate the vulnerability, as the issue has been addressed in the Ubuntu repository.


I hope this helps.


Regards,
Cristi

I informed the customer. The customer got back to us with:

""That recommendation is sort of surprising, since this is an appliance, and we have no access to the operating system. If this indeed needs to be patched, meaning that it is exploitable when the server is deployed as an appliance, you’ll need to provide a patch for the appliance. ""

Please confirm if this is something that the customer needs to fix on their end or if it is a Backend Security Upgrade or something else that support can do?

Thank you!

@WaitingOnEngineer

Customer can perform backend security updates via dedicated section in webui, without backend console access. Please refer to user manual: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/Dashboard/SystemDashboard.htm#security_updates.

However, for Netwrix hosted environment this feature is hidden, as host image patching is maintain by our DevOps team.

Hi Flaviu,

I hope you are well.

As our EPP server backend is directly connected to Official Ubuntu Repository, we definitely recommend to the customer to follow the security updates and as highlighted in the article Krzysztof provided, it is recommended to apply all security related patches provided by the Ubuntu Repository.

We will look into asking someone from QA to test this, however, it is highly recommended that the customer applies any available security related patches on a regular manner

Thank you,
Cristi
