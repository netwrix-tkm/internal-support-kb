In the meeting we have discussed, about the LDAP issue and verified if they have an AD integration. Their AD integration is up and running.

They will check internally to verify if the newly LDAP have a new configuration and if they need to change the integration with EPP.

We also discussed about the EPP UI URL that is not secure and you can secure it, by importing a certificate in the UI under the Appliance section - Server Maintenance.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-03-20T10:19:35.000Z"
