Hi Daniel,

Good day!
Yes, we intend to generate an SSL from the EPP server.
There are 2 ways to do so, if EPP server is also a CA, then the self-signed cert can be prepared.
Otherwise, can we know how to get the CSR from the EPP server in order to get customer's internal CA to sign the cert instead ?

Thank you!

Thank you for getting back to us.

We do not generate SSL certificates,  you will have to create a certificate signed by a trusted third party Certificate Authority.
Once the certificate is created please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance import their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.



Have a nice day ahead!
