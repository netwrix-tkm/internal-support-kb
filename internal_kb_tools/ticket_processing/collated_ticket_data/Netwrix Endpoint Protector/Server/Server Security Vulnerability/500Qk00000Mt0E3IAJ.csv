Our EPP server is currently getting scanned by Tenable for vulnerabilities. There are currently 253 vulnerabilities, obviously only a few of them being critical. Would I need someone from your team to support in patching these? Or would the secondary root account that was created by you for us to use have the appropriate permissions to so?","","Connected remote along with Andrei Pop to assist Jovan.
