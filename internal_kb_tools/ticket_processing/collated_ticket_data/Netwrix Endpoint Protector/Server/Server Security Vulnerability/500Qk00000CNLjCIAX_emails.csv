Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.
[A close-up of a computer screen  Description automatically generated]
It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.
[A white background with colorful text  Description automatically generated]

I rebooted the server since it doesn't appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.  

 

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.


 

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.


 

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.



 

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.


 

I rebooted the server since it doesn’t appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.
[A close-up of a computer screen  Description automatically generated]

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.
[A white background with colorful text  Description automatically generated]

I rebooted the server since it doesn't appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.  

 

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.


 

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.


 

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.



 

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.


 

I rebooted the server since it doesn’t appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Matt,

I apologise for leaving the call, my electricity got cut off for a few hours and it only just now came back.
Could we reschedule for Wednesday and we'll take a look at the boot partition to install the security updates?

Hi Matt,

I apologise for leaving the call, my electricity got cut off for a few hours and it only just now came back.
Could we reschedule for Wednesday and we'll take a look at the boot partition to install the security updates?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CNLjC:ref


Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.
[A close-up of a computer screen  Description automatically generated]

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.
[A white background with colorful text  Description automatically generated]

I rebooted the server since it doesn't appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.  

 

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.


 

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.


 

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.



 

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.


 

I rebooted the server since it doesn’t appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.

Hi Matt,

I apologise for leaving the call, my electricity got cut off for a few hours and it only just now came back.
Could we reschedule for Wednesday and we'll take a look at the boot partition to install the security updates?

Hi Matt,

I apologise for leaving the call, my electricity got cut off for a few hours and it only just now came back.
Could we reschedule for Wednesday and we'll take a look at the boot partition to install the security updates?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CNLjC:ref

 


Hi Botond, I installed the hotfix via Live Update.  See below for the ensuing issues that have occurred. I have a VMware snapshot to revert to so let me know if you think I need to revert.  

 

When I look at installed updates it shows it was installed as you can see here.


 

However, the Hotfix still shows as an available update even after installing it.


 

Also, as I normally do when installing updates to EPP I also checked for and applied Backed Updates.  They also still show as available after I applied them.



 

It does not appear that the backend updates are actually getting applied as seen here.


 

I rebooted the server since it doesn’t appear that any of the updates are applying and now none of the administrator account are able to log in except for the root account.
