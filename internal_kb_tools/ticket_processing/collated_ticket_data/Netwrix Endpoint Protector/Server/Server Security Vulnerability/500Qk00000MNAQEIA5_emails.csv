I have a status update on this case. Engineering provided me with the following:

Setting frame-ancestors to 'none' will block certain resources from loading, particularly content embedded within <iframe>, <embed>, and <object> elements.

Affected areas:

-   Header and  Footer -  images are loaded inside <object> elements
-   Download of shadowed resources - These are loaded inside a hidden <iframe> element.


To implement frame-ancestors: 'none', code changes will be required.
If no changes are made to the code, an alternative solution would be to set frame-ancestors to 'self'.

Could you please confirm if maintaining frame-ancestors as 'self' would meet your requirements?

We are actively working on obtaining clarification regarding the possibility of setting one of the headers to read-only. Additionally, We are exploring the option to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" headers to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.""

Thank you for your time and patience.

I have an update to this case. I've received important guidance from our engineering team regarding adjustments to your Content-Security-Policy settings.

Content-Security-Policy Adjustment: It is possible to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only."" This adjustment will allow for monitoring of policy violations without immediate enforcement.

Frame-Ancestors Directive: It's advised not to set the frame-ancestors directive to 'none,' as this would block certain resources from loading and could disrupt functionality. The recommended solution is to set it to ""self,"" permitting resources that belong to the same origin.

To ensure these changes are implemented correctly, I would like to schedule a remote session at your earliest convenience. During this session, we will make the necessary changes together. Please let me know your available days and times, along with your time zone, so we can arrange the session accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to assisting you.

Hello Lucas,

This is the second attempt at informing you that we received important guidance from our engineering team regarding adjustments to your Content-Security-Policy settings.

Content-Security-Policy Adjustment: It is possible to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only."" This adjustment will allow for monitoring of policy violations without immediate enforcement.

Frame-Ancestors Directive: It's advised not to set the frame-ancestors directive to 'none,' as this would block certain resources from loading and could disrupt functionality. The recommended solution is to set it to ""self,"" permitting resources that belong to the same origin.

To ensure these changes are implemented correctly, I would like to schedule a remote session at your earliest convenience. During this session, we will make the necessary changes together. Please let me know your available days and times, along with your time zone, so we can arrange the session accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to assisting you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Lucas,

I have a status update on this case. Engineering provided me with the following:

Setting frame-ancestors to 'none' will block certain resources from loading, particularly content embedded within <iframe>, <embed>, and <object> elements.

Affected areas:

-   Header and  Footer -  images are loaded inside <object> elements
-   Download of shadowed resources - These are loaded inside a hidden <iframe> element.


To implement frame-ancestors: 'none', code changes will be required.
If no changes are made to the code, an alternative solution would be to set frame-ancestors to 'self'.

Could you please confirm if maintaining frame-ancestors as 'self' would meet your requirements?

We are actively working on obtaining clarification regarding the possibility of setting one of the headers to read-only. Additionally, We are exploring the option to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" headers to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.""

Thank you for your time and patience.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Lucas,

This is the second attempt at informing you that we received important guidance from our engineering team regarding adjustments to your Content-Security-Policy settings.

Content-Security-Policy Adjustment: It is possible to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only."" This adjustment will allow for monitoring of policy violations without immediate enforcement.

Frame-Ancestors Directive: It's advised not to set the frame-ancestors directive to 'none,' as this would block certain resources from loading and could disrupt functionality. The recommended solution is to set it to ""self,"" permitting resources that belong to the same origin.

To ensure these changes are implemented correctly, I would like to schedule a remote session at your earliest convenience. During this session, we will make the necessary changes together. Please let me know your available days and times, along with your time zone, so we can arrange the session accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to assisting you.

Hello Lucas,

I have a status update on this case. Engineering provided me with the following:

Setting frame-ancestors to 'none' will block certain resources from loading, particularly content embedded within <iframe>, <embed>, and <object> elements.

Affected areas:

-   Header and  Footer -  images are loaded inside <object> elements
-   Download of shadowed resources - These are loaded inside a hidden <iframe> element.


To implement frame-ancestors: 'none', code changes will be required.
If no changes are made to the code, an alternative solution would be to set frame-ancestors to 'self'.

Could you please confirm if maintaining frame-ancestors as 'self' would meet your requirements?

We are actively working on obtaining clarification regarding the possibility of setting one of the headers to read-only. Additionally, We are exploring the option to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" headers to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.""

Thank you for your time and patience.

Hello Lucas,

I have a status update on this case. Engineering provided me with the following:

Setting frame-ancestors to 'none' will block certain resources from loading, particularly content embedded within <iframe>, <embed>, and <object> elements.

Affected areas:

-   Header and  Footer -  images are loaded inside <object> elements
-   Download of shadowed resources - These are loaded inside a hidden <iframe> element.


To implement frame-ancestors: 'none', code changes will be required.
If no changes are made to the code, an alternative solution would be to set frame-ancestors to 'self'.

Could you please confirm if maintaining frame-ancestors as 'self' would meet your requirements?

We are actively working on obtaining clarification regarding the possibility of setting one of the headers to read-only. Additionally, We are exploring the option to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" headers to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only.""

Thank you for your time and patience.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Lucas,

This is the second attempt at informing you that we received important guidance from our engineering team regarding adjustments to your Content-Security-Policy settings.

Content-Security-Policy Adjustment: It is possible to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only."" This adjustment will allow for monitoring of policy violations without immediate enforcement.

Frame-Ancestors Directive: It's advised not to set the frame-ancestors directive to 'none,' as this would block certain resources from loading and could disrupt functionality. The recommended solution is to set it to ""self,"" permitting resources that belong to the same origin.

To ensure these changes are implemented correctly, I would like to schedule a remote session at your earliest convenience. During this session, we will make the necessary changes together. Please let me know your available days and times, along with your time zone, so we can arrange the session accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to assisting you.
