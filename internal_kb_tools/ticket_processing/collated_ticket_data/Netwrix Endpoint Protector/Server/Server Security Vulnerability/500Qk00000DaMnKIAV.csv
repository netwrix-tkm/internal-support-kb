However, Even after the update being successful, I still see the pending patch updates under Available EPP Software Updates.

I have tried contacting via email but didnt receive any response. As this is a critical security patch. Kindly let us know how this can be fixed at the earliest.","","","","The customer confirmed the closure","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","","41.9","Closed - Resolved","Alacriti Payments LLC","Rahul Pandey","2024-07-26T10:31:45.000Z","2024-09-06T08:35:21.000Z"
