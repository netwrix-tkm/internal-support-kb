Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I was wondering what server version you are using? Can you login to the console and tell me the version in the bottom right of the window?

I was trying to reproduce the first finding and was not seeing that header appear. I wanted to see the version that you were running to see if that was patched out with a later release. For the second finding with the cert, that can be remediated by adding your own cert to the console to be used when connecting to it from the browser. I will be entering a ticket with engineering to get their take on the internal IP disclosure in the meantime.

Let me know if you would like a remote session to add the cert to the console.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hello Alex,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I was wondering what server version you are using? Can you login to the console and tell me the version in the bottom right of the window?

I was trying to reproduce the first finding and was not seeing that header appear. I wanted to see the version that you were running to see if that was patched out with a later release. For the second finding with the cert, that can be remediated by adding your own cert to the console to be used when connecting to it from the browser. I will be entering a ticket with engineering to get their take on the internal IP disclosure in the meantime.

Let me know if you would like a remote session to add the cert to the console.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
