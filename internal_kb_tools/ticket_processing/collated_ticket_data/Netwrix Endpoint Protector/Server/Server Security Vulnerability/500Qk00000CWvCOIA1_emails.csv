Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Is it alright with you if we postpone today's remote session until the fix is released?

Hi Michael,

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Is it alright with you if we postpone today's remote session until the fix is released?

Hi Michael,

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Is it alright with you if we postpone today's remote session until the fix is released?

Best regards,

Hi Michael,

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Is it alright with you if we postpone today's remote session until the fix is released?

Hi Michael,

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Is it alright with you if we postpone today's remote session until the fix is released?

Do you mind sending me the Mac script again for installing the EPP client? I accidentally closed my vscode instance and did not save…
