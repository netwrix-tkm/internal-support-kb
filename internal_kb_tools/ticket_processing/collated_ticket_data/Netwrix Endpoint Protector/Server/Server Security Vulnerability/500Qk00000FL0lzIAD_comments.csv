Hi,

In our latest (5.9.4.0) EPP Server image, we are using these in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:


--- CODE ---
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
--- CODE ---

You may modify/set the same lines inside the same file on the customer's EPPServer appliance and then restart SSH:


--- CODE ---service ssh restart
--- CODE ---

Best,
Catalin

They also had another line which we commented out:

@WaitingOnEngineer

That line is missing from all of the recent images and I do not recall any past time when that was present on any image. We are probably talking here about a very old image that the customer uses, and that line might, when it was introduced, have intended to mitigate some of the possible security reports/issues that come with the default SSH setting. I recommend not commenting it out as there might arise a new report from the customer regarding security if perchance commenting it out is found by their scanner to reduce the system's security.

Our servers run on Ubuntu images, as you already know. When an Ubuntu version is about to run out of support, we build a new image, based on a newer OS version, one that is supported. We don't do an assessment of all the differences between the 2 versions of the OS, since anyways, the old one will be unsupported and customers will want to use the new one.

Regarding the notification about the new image, you are right, we didn't notify you, but we did report this request and our team is working on a plan to have notifications sent for these cases to the customers in the future.

The path going forward for you would be to install a new appliance using the latest image (Ubuntu 22.04 based) and then migrate the database from the current appliance to the new one. That way, you will have an up to date appliance from a security/OS version point of view and you can also upgrade the EPP server version to the latest one.","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-03-04T14:11:04.000Z","2025-03-04T14:11:04.000Z","false","false"
