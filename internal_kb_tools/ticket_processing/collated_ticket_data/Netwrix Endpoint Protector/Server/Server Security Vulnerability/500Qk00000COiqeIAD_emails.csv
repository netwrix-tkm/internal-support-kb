Hello Flaviu,

Many thanks. Can the latest agents be installed on top of existing agents or does it have to be a fresh install? We have an automated deployment software so I am wondering if we can use it.

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,

We have been unable to test the installs due to the console still saying there is an update available.

[cid:image001.png@01DACC86.E59370A0]

These are the last 2 updates we did.

[cid:image002.png@01DACC86.E59370A0]

The available update seems to be the same as our last one, but it does not go away even if I tell it to update. Is that update needed or can it be ignored?

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,

Many thanks. Can the latest agents be installed on top of existing agents or does it have to be a fresh install? We have an automated deployment software so I am wondering if we can use it.

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,

 

We have been unable to test the installs due to the console still saying there is an update available.

 



 

These are the last 2 updates we did.

 



 

The available update seems to be the same as our last one, but it does not go away even if I tell it to update. Is that update needed or can it be ignored?

 

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,

 

We will test pushing it over existing agents to see if that works. If not, we will go the other route. I’ll keep you updated.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

You are welcome!

For macOS the EPP agents can be installed over older agents.

Ideally for Windows the process should be Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install new version. You can try to push the new EPP agent over the existing agents on a test group(a few test computers) and then reboot those computers. If this is successful it can be pushed out directly for the rest of the computers. If it doesn't upgrade the EPP agents then the Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install process should be done.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello Flaviu,

 

We will test pushing it over existing agents to see if that works. If not, we will go the other route. I’ll keep you updated.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

You are welcome!

For macOS the EPP agents can be installed over older agents.

Ideally for Windows the process should be Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install new version. You can try to push the new EPP agent over the existing agents on a test group(a few test computers) and then reboot those computers. If this is successful it can be pushed out directly for the rest of the computers. If it doesn't upgrade the EPP agents then the Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install process should be done.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello Flaviu,

 

Many thanks. Can the latest agents be installed on top of existing agents or does it have to be a fresh install? We have an automated deployment software so I am wondering if we can use it.

 

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,



We have been unable to test the installs due to the console still saying there is an update available.

These are the last 2 updates we did.

The available update seems to be the same as our last one, but it does not go away even if I tell it to update. Is that update needed or can it be ignored?

Hello Flaviu,

 

We will test pushing it over existing agents to see if that works. If not, we will go the other route. I’ll keep you updated.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

You are welcome!

For macOS the EPP agents can be installed over older agents.

Ideally for Windows the process should be Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install new version. You can try to push the new EPP agent over the existing agents on a test group(a few test computers) and then reboot those computers. If this is successful it can be pushed out directly for the rest of the computers. If it doesn't upgrade the EPP agents then the Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install process should be done.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello Flaviu,

 

Many thanks. Can the latest agents be installed on top of existing agents or does it have to be a fresh install? We have an automated deployment software so I am wondering if we can use it.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

For the time being please ignore that message as it will appear because it is a non-versioned patch(can be applied several times on different EPP server versions).

Please hold off on upgrading the EPP clients or re-applying the vulnerability patch for now.

Our colleagues from the dev team are currently working on an updated version of the Hotfix. I will keep you posted as soon as I have updates on this.

Hello Flaviu,

 

We have been unable to test the installs due to the console still saying there is an update available.

 



 

These are the last 2 updates we did.

 



 

The available update seems to be the same as our last one, but it does not go away even if I tell it to update. Is that update needed or can it be ignored?

 

Thank you.

Hello Flaviu,

 

We will test pushing it over existing agents to see if that works. If not, we will go the other route. I’ll keep you updated.

 

Thank you.

Hi Zach,

You are welcome!

For macOS the EPP agents can be installed over older agents.

Ideally for Windows the process should be Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install new version. You can try to push the new EPP agent over the existing agents on a test group(a few test computers) and then reboot those computers. If this is successful it can be pushed out directly for the rest of the computers. If it doesn't upgrade the EPP agents then the Uninstall -> Reboot -> Install process should be done.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello Flaviu,

 

Many thanks. Can the latest agents be installed on top of existing agents or does it have to be a fresh install? We have an automated deployment software so I am wondering if we can use it.

 

Thank you.
