Opening the ticket to continuate this point:

The customer replied:

They are ok with the strict-transport-security alteration.

About the ""Content-Security-Policy"" alteration, they are fundamental to them. They suggested changing to something like Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only so it won't interfere in the EPP UI.
Adding to that, the frame-ancestors 'none' needs to be added to the ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only"". Thats the main point for them to close this.

Let me know if the alterations are possible.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-27T14:41:08.000Z"
