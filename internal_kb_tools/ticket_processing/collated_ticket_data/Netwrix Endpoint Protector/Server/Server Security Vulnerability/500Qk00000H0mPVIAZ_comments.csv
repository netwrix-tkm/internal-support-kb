Hi Adrian, @WaitingOnEngineer,

The password issue is a known issue in EPP which will be fixed in 5.9.4.1.Â 
In 5.9.4.1, we will release multiple improvements related to EPP Security. In addition, there will be a lot of improvements related to DB passwords.

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Cristi

Hi Adrian, @WaitingOnEngineer,

Apologies for the inconvenience. I initially misread the request.

To clarify, in 5.9.4.1, there will be improvements related to the passwords stored in the DB (these will be encrypted), not the DB password itself.

Regarding the password for the Database, we will need to discuss about it with Dev, Product and Security team.

Again, sorry for the confusion.

Regards,
Cristi
