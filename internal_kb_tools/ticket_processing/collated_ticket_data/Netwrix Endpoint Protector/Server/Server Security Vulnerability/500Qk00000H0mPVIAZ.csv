We implemented EPP server using the EPP appliance in ING V-center. Below is one of the penetration testing finding:
Title: Default or Easily-Guessable DB User Credentials
Description: Default or easily-guessable user credentials are very dangerous for the application security. An attacker with no much effort can gain access to the private section of the application. Guessed/cracked password can be used to log in to private section of the application and pivot attacks to authorized users. Now an attacker have much wider area for exploiting application.
Recommendation: All default password in the application should be changed. Application should also employ strong password policy.
Additional Information: 
CWE-1391 <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1391.html' target='_blank'>https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1391.html</a> OWASP <a href='https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-' target='_blank'>https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-</a> Authentication_Testing/02-Testing_for_Default_Credentials
As we can not SSH to the EPP appliance , it will not be possible for us to change the credential of the DB user. Can you please let us know how can we have it changed to something complex?","","","this customer is waiting for the 5941 Offline patch - so we need to keep the escalation open until the patch will be available as the customer will be able to check the improvements and validate them only afterwards.","Closed by sending the offline patch for 5941","","Adrian Draghici","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","-","132.9","Closed - Resolved","ING companies","Sudipa Bera","2024-10-14T15:12:14.000Z","2025-02-24T12:57:57.000Z"
