"500Qk00000JohzjIAB","00430543","Support Ticket","Request for Fixing Vulnerabilities Identified During NIS Audit","*** This issue applies exclusively to the KOSPO customer. ***

The customer, KOSPO, is a public organization using an EPP5940 server with 3,600 users (Appliance ID: 7135505250). Recently, they underwent a security audit by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), and the following 4 vulnerabilities were identified and need to be resolved.

Please confirm whether the 4 issues below can be resolved via remote support and provide two of the earliest possible remote support schedules.

#1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
The jQuery usage detection and version information must be removed to comply with Nessus scan requirements. After mitigating the vulnerability, accessing the URL (<a href='https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js' target='_blank'>https://EPP-IP/js/jquery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js</a>)  must not reveal any content.

#2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
Please remove the <a href='https://robots.txt' target='_blank'>robots.txt</a> file (<a href='https://EPP-IP/robots.txt' target='_blank'>https://EPP-IP/robots.txt</a>).


#3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Please configure all error pages, such as 404 and 401, to display the same generic Error page or a blank page without distinction.

For example, the URL below should display the same generic error page or a blank page, regardless of distinctions such as 404, 401, etc.
https://EPP-IP/1
https://EPP-IP/wstats
https://EPP-IP/wsdocs
and so on.


#4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
1) <a href='https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt' target='_blank'>https://EPP-IP/client.php?dir=http://blog.cirt.net/rfiinc.txt</a>
2) <a href='https://EPP-IP/client.php' target='_blank'>https://EPP-IP/client.php</a>
Please both of the above pages must be removed.","","Our Security team gave the below responses on the vulnerabilities being raised, please see below.

Kospo vulnerability #1. Removal of jQuery Detection and Version Information Disclosure
It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

Kospo vulnerability #2. Removal of Unnecessary Text Files on the Web Server
The robots.txt file is harmless and serves a valuable purpose for instances exposed to the Internet. This is not a vulnerability and it will not be removed.

Kospo vulnerability #3. Improper Error Page Exception Handling on the Web Server
Could you please ask the customer to provide a concrete example of how this results in a vulnerability. For example, if the application shows different responses that leads one to be able to determine whether a user account exists or not.

Kospo vulnerability #4. Web Server Paths Accessible Without Login
This page is has a legitimate purpose for being un-authenticated and we do not consider this a vulnerability. It will not be removed.
