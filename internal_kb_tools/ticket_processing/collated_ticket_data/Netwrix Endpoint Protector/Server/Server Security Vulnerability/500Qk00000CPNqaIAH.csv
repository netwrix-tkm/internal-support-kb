"500Qk00000CPNqaIAH","00413357","Support Ticket","ADV-2024-002 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","Hello! I am reaching out with regard to the Remote Code Execution Vulnerability you guys alerted to us recently. It's to my understanding we need to patch the server with the 5.9.1.0 hotfix, since our server's version is 5.9.1.0. However, do we need to do any patching for the agents before implementing that hotfix on the server? We just want to avoid breaking anything. Our system engineer normally responsible for EPP is out on PTO. And in my experience, we've had to update agents before actually updating the server. That said, this is just a hotfix, so I assume that's not the case? Also, I don't actually know what the OS version of the server is, since it is hosted by you guys. We just have access to the admin console.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","","18.6","Closed - Resolved","Cleerly","Kenneth Bittala","2024-06-28T00:01:20.000Z","2024-07-16T14:16:51.000Z"
