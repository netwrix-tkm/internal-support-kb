Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case? 

From the request we understood that you would like to change the LDAP security to be signed? Are you referring to the EPP UI console to be signed ? 

If yes, then you will need to create a SSL certificate and add it to the EPP UI under the Appliance menu > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?

From the request we understood that you would like to change the LDAP security to be signed? Are you referring to the EPP UI console to be signed ?

If yes, then you will need to create a SSL certificate and add it to the EPP UI under the Appliance menu > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.

Hello,

 

Yes we are using actually LDAP configuration in EPP for connect admin user to EPP UI.

 

Our LDAP manager in Germany told us that now configuration for EPP client is not signed and on 1 of April will not work if we cannot change LDAP client settings to singed.

Is this a different LDAP server? 
Currently you are using a LDAP integration with EPP ? Do you want to change it ?

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case? 

From the request we understood that you would like to change the LDAP security to be signed? Are you referring to the EPP UI console to be signed ? 

If yes, then you will need to create a SSL certificate and add it to the EPP UI under the Appliance menu > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Yes we are using actually LDAP configuration in EPP for connect admin user to EPP UI.

Our LDAP manager in Germany told us that now configuration for EPP client is not signed and on 1 of April will not work if we cannot change LDAP client settings to singed.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?

From the request we understood that you would like to change the LDAP security to be signed? Are you referring to the EPP UI console to be signed ?

If yes, then you will need to create a SSL certificate and add it to the EPP UI under the Appliance menu > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
