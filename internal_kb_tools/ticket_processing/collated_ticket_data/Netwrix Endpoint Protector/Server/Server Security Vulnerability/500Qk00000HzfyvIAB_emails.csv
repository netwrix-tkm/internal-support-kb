Thank you for reaching out!

As mentioned in the screenshot you will. have to create a certificate signed by a trusted third party Certificate Authority.
Once the certificate is created please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance import their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.



Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
