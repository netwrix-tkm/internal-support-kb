"500Qk00000CstTdIAJ","00414618","Support Ticket","OpenSSL RegreSSHion Vulnerability","Good afternoon,

I was hoping to get some clarification on the Open SSL RegreSSHion vulnerability that it seems our virtual appliance is vulnerable to.

Is there a patch imminent that will be released ? or do you have any further guidance on how we can mitigate this ? E.G turn off SSH.

Kind regards,
Tom","","","","Solved. Confirmed with the customer that Hotfix 1.1 was applied succesfully.
