The below screenshot is what we have extracted from your list that is of critical severity (28 vulnerabilities).



I wanted to confirm with you, that you are running the latest Endpoint Protector version, 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22 and that you have run a recent check for backend security updates and applied them if any available.   If you didn't yet, then can I ask that you please do this as soon as convenient to you, then run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining please?

You can check the Ubuntu version on the ""System Information"" page, you will find the page under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Information"".

Looking forward to your response.

I have made a system backup yesterday so I will install the backup security updates and update you once completed and rescanned.

Hi Andre,

I have run all recent backend security patches, and it seemed to have make no difference to the number of vulnerabilities in Tenable.

Hi Jovan,

The below screenshot is what we have extracted from your list that is of critical severity (28 vulnerabilities).

[cid:image001.png@01DB9CB5.27F03970]

I wanted to confirm with you, that you are running the latest Endpoint Protector version, 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22 and that you have run a recent check for backend security updates and applied them if any available.   If you didn't yet, then can I ask that you please do this as soon as convenient to you, then run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining please?

You can check the Ubuntu version on the ""System Information"" page, you will find the page under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Information"".

Looking forward to your response.


Kind regards

From the provided screenshots I can see there are some available updates present in the BackendSecurity Updates section:




Could you please try first to create a snapshot of the EPP appliance from your virtualization environment, then try to apply the backend security updates by clicking ''Apply backend updates''.

Wait for the progress bar to reach 100%, refresh the page and then check for backend updates again.

Hello Jovan,

Thank you for following up on this.

I need to take this internally with our team but for that, could you please provide us a screenshot of the Appliance-> Server Information?

Also, after you've done that, take another one from the Dashboard->Live update->check backend updates after you've clicked on the button.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Andre,

I have run all recent backend security patches, and it seemed to have make no difference to the number of vulnerabilities in Tenable.

Hi Jovan,

The below screenshot is what we have extracted from your list that is of critical severity (28 vulnerabilities).

[cid:image004.png@01DB9DA7.67076A00]

I wanted to confirm with you, that you are running the latest Endpoint Protector version, 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22 and that you have run a recent check for backend security updates and applied them if any available.   If you didn't yet, then can I ask that you please do this as soon as convenient to you, then run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining please?

You can check the Ubuntu version on the ""System Information"" page, you will find the page under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Information"".

Looking forward to your response.


Kind regards

Hi Marian,

I will run these as well and let you know; these are new ones. There were a lot more before the last scan which I ran but it did not seem to resolve any of the vulnerabilities. Will keep you updated.

Hello Jovan,

Thanks for getting back to us.

From the provided screenshots I can see there are some available updates present in the BackendSecurity Updates section:




Could you please try first to create a snapshot of the EPP appliance from your virtualization environment, then try to apply the backend security updates by clicking ''Apply backend updates''.

Wait for the progress bar to reach 100%, refresh the page and then check for backend updates again.

If the returned message is ''No update are available'' please run the vulnerability scan one more time.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Marian,

I ran the backend updates as suggested but it does not seem to have disappeared, still shows the same updates. 



 

Should I do anything else?

Kind Regards

Jovan

Hello Jovan,

Thanks for getting back to us.

From the provided screenshots I can see there are some available updates present in the BackendSecurity Updates section:




Could you please try first to create a snapshot of the EPP appliance from your virtualization environment, then try to apply the backend security updates by clicking ''Apply backend updates''.

Wait for the progress bar to reach 100%, refresh the page and then check for backend updates again.

If the returned message is ''No update are available'' please run the vulnerability scan one more time.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Jovan,

Thank you for following up on this.

I need to take this internally with our team but for that, could you please provide us a screenshot of the Appliance-> Server Information?

Also, after you've done that, take another one from the Dashboard->Live update->check backend updates after you've clicked on the button.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Jovan,

The below screenshot is what we have extracted from your list that is of critical severity (28 vulnerabilities).



I wanted to confirm with you, that you are running the latest Endpoint Protector version, 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22 and that you have run a recent check for backend security updates and applied them if any available.   If you didn't yet, then can I ask that you please do this as soon as convenient to you, then run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining please?

You can check the Ubuntu version on the ""System Information"" page, you will find the page under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Information"".

Looking forward to your response.


Kind regards

Thank you for following up on this.

I have scheduled a remote session for today at 12:30 Switzerland timezone.

Click the link below to join the conference at the specified date and time:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/81088270024?pwd=HjeKdwX9K9bQXsCcx1rVtPpyoRL0ia.1
Dial-in Info
+1 312 626 6799 
Additional numbers may be available upon entering the conference.  Additional Numbers

Meeting Number
81088270024

Password
400087
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom

Should I do anything else?

Hello Jovan,

Thanks for getting back to us.

From the provided screenshots I can see there are some available updates present in the BackendSecurity Updates section:




Could you please try first to create a snapshot of the EPP appliance from your virtualization environment, then try to apply the backend security updates by clicking ''Apply backend updates''.

Wait for the progress bar to reach 100%, refresh the page and then check for backend updates again.

If the returned message is ''No update are available'' please run the vulnerability scan one more time.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for following up on this.

I need to take this internally with our team but for that, could you please provide us a screenshot of the Appliance-> Server Information?

Also, after you've done that, take another one from the Dashboard->Live update->check backend updates after you've clicked on the button.

Hi Jovan,

The below screenshot is what we have extracted from your list that is of critical severity (28 vulnerabilities).



I wanted to confirm with you, that you are running the latest Endpoint Protector version, 5.9.4.1 on Ubuntu 22 and that you have run a recent check for backend security updates and applied them if any available.   If you didn't yet, then can I ask that you please do this as soon as convenient to you, then run another Tenable scan so that I can send a new report to our Security team for the vulnerabilities that are still remaining please?

You can check the Ubuntu version on the ""System Information"" page, you will find the page under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Information"".

Looking forward to your response.


Kind regards

Hello Jovan,

Thank you for following up on this.

I have scheduled a remote session for today at 12:30 Switzerland timezone.

Click the link below to join the conference at the specified date and time:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/81088270024?pwd=HjeKdwX9K9bQXsCcx1rVtPpyoRL0ia.1
Dial-in Info
+1 312 626 6799
Additional numbers may be available upon entering the conference.  Additional Numbers<https://zoom.us/zoomconference>

Meeting Number
81088270024

Password
400087


As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom
