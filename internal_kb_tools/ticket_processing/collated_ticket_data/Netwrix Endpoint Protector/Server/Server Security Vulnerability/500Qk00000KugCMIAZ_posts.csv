This ticket is regarding the recently reported security vulnerability ADV-2025-001. We have taken action and upgraded our CoSoSys-hosted server to the patched version 5.9.4.1. However, I have a question regarding the credential updates mentioned in the advisory documentation, specifically under the “Solution” section, which states:

“We recommend adhering to best practices by updating the following credentials:
•AWS S3 Bucket Secret Key
•FTP Credentials
•SMB Credentials
•Azure Active Directory Authentication Credential
•Azure Active Directory Access Token
•Azure Active Directory Client Secret”

Could you clarify whether these credentials are related solely to features configured in the Endpoint Protector ADMIN portal (e.g., SIEM integrations, etc.), or if this recommendation also applies to any credentials that end users may have interacted with on their endpoints? (i.e., NOT EPP admin portal configurations).

For context, we only use Endpoint Protector on our end-user macOS devices. We do not run EPP on any servers or Windows devices. Is there any impact on the macOS devices running the Endpoint Protector client, such as developers interacting with AWS secret keys or other credentials during their regular work? For example, if a user configures an AWS secret key locally on their Mac for CLI use, would that key need updating, or is this advisory strictly focused on server-side configurations? We are hoping its only the latter.

Please confirm ASAP.

Thank you.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-22T00:09:45.000Z"
