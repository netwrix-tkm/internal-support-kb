We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

Hi Flaviu,

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is
whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually
applying it to the server?

Best,
Kenneth

The Hotfix for the agents was released, but we are currently waiting to receive updates on this from our devs.

Currently we are waiting to receive the updated Hotfix for the EPP server and also the EPP clients with the hotfix.

In case you did not apply the fix yet, please hold on with applying it for a few days.

Hi Flaviu, 

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually applying it to the server? 

Best,
Kenneth

Hi Ken,

We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

Hi there. We're closed on the 5th of July due the 4th of July holiday. Our
system engineer normally in charge of deploying the patches to this
particular system is back, so I might not need to do a remote session with
you at this time. But I do appreciate the extra assistance. If I do end up
needing to schedule something, I'll let you know.

Hi Ken,

Thank you!

The Hotfix for the agents was released, but we are currently waiting to receive updates on this from our devs.

Currently we are waiting to receive the updated Hotfix for the EPP server and also the EPP clients with the hotfix.

Hi Flaviu, 

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually applying it to the server? 

Best,
Kenneth

Hi Ken,

We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

Hey Flaviu,

Just to confirm, the agent hotfixes are going to be compatible with our
current server version 5.9.1.0, right? And I do recall you said to deploy
the hotfix to the server first before the agents. That's still the case
after the revised hotfix?

Best,

Kenneth

The Hotfix is not versioned, meaning it can be applied on any EPP server version starting from 5.9.0.0 till 5.9.3.0.

The agents can be deployed after the EPP server hotfix was installed.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if you have availability for a quick remote session and we will apply the server hotfix.

Hey Flaviu,

Just to confirm, the agent hotfixes are going to be compatible with our current server version 5.9.1.0, right? And I do recall you said to deploy the hotfix to the server first before the agents. That's still the case after the revised hotfix?

Best,

Kenneth

Hi there. We're closed on the 5th of July due the 4th of July holiday. Our system engineer normally in charge of deploying the patches to this particular system is back, so I might not need to do a remote session with you at this time. But I do appreciate the extra assistance. If I do end up needing to schedule something, I'll let you know.

Hi Ken,

Thank you!

The Hotfix for the agents was released, but we are currently waiting to receive updates on this from our devs.

Currently we are waiting to receive the updated Hotfix for the EPP server and also the EPP clients with the hotfix.

Hi Flaviu, 

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually applying it to the server? 

Best,
Kenneth

Hi Ken,

We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

Thanks for confirming that.  We just wanted to confirm that everything is
compatible before we start upgrading so a remote session is not required
but the offer is appreciated.  I'll get the upgrades scheduled for this
evening and we'll reach back out if there are any issues.

Thanks for confirming that.  We just wanted to confirm that everything is compatible before we start upgrading so a remote session is not required but the offer is appreciated.  I'll get the upgrades scheduled for this evening and we'll reach back out if there are any issues.

Hi Ken,

The Hotfix is not versioned, meaning it can be applied on any EPP server version starting from 5.9.0.0 till 5.9.3.0.

The agents can be deployed after the EPP server hotfix was installed.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if you have availability for a quick remote session and we will apply the server hotfix.

Hey Flaviu,

Just to confirm, the agent hotfixes are going to be compatible with our current server version 5.9.1.0, right? And I do recall you said to deploy the hotfix to the server first before the agents. That's still the case after the revised hotfix?

Best,

Kenneth

Hi there. We're closed on the 5th of July due the 4th of July holiday. Our system engineer normally in charge of deploying the patches to this particular system is back, so I might not need to do a remote session with you at this time. But I do appreciate the extra assistance. If I do end up needing to schedule something, I'll let you know.

Hi Ken,

Thank you!

The Hotfix for the agents was released, but we are currently waiting to receive updates on this from our devs.

Currently we are waiting to receive the updated Hotfix for the EPP server and also the EPP clients with the hotfix.

Hi Flaviu, 

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually applying it to the server? 

Best,
Kenneth

Hi Ken,

We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

Thanks for confirming that.  We just wanted to confirm that everything is compatible before we start upgrading so a remote session is not required but the offer is appreciated.  I'll get the upgrades scheduled for this evening and we'll reach back out if there are any issues.

Hi Ken,

The Hotfix is not versioned, meaning it can be applied on any EPP server version starting from 5.9.0.0 till 5.9.3.0.

The agents can be deployed after the EPP server hotfix was installed.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if you have availability for a quick remote session and we will apply the server hotfix.

Hey Flaviu,

Just to confirm, the agent hotfixes are going to be compatible with our current server version 5.9.1.0, right? And I do recall you said to deploy the hotfix to the server first before the agents. That's still the case after the revised hotfix?

Best,

Kenneth

Hi there. We're closed on the 5th of July due the 4th of July holiday. Our system engineer normally in charge of deploying the patches to this particular system is back, so I might not need to do a remote session with you at this time. But I do appreciate the extra assistance. If I do end up needing to schedule something, I'll let you know.

Hi Ken,

Thank you!

The Hotfix for the agents was released, but we are currently waiting to receive updates on this from our devs.

Currently we are waiting to receive the updated Hotfix for the EPP server and also the EPP clients with the hotfix.

Hi Flaviu, 

We're going to keep it on 5.9.1.0 and apply the fix. But my question is whether or not we need to apply a hotfix for the agents before actually applying it to the server? 

Best,
Kenneth

Hi Ken,

We hope you are doing well.

I would recommend one of the following actions server wise:
1. Upgrading the EPP server to 5.9.3.0 and then applying the Fix one more time.
2. Leaving the EPP server on 5.9.1.0 with the Fix applied.

Client wise:
We currently have agents containing the fix. I will add the download link below for them.

We are also working on the Offline Client patch that will also contain the upgraded EPP client versions. This unfortunately is not ready yet.

Download links:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Please let me know what works best for you and we can schedule a remote session the following days.

I think we may have an issue with content filtering on our VPN firewall to

Please find below the ports that are usually used by the EPP server:
 
1. 443: Server communicates with the clients through this port(inbound should be enough).
 
2. 80: The EPP server uses port 80 for Live Update feature(liveupdate.endpointprotector.com / IP: 178.63.3.86) in order to download server patches. The Live Update is not needed to be kept open as the server doesn't automatically update(needs to be done manually by admins) and we also can provide Offline Patches for the EPP server versions.
 
3. 22: The ssh port 22 is also used on EPP server side but only by us, the support team, in case a support intervention is required.
 
4. 389: For Active Directory the default port 389.

I am not aware of any other exceptions that need to be made in the firewall besides these ones.

The public IP of the EPP server is: 44.199.80.17.

The FQDN or URL used by the agents to communicate with the EPP server can be found either:

1. on the EPP Server URL(Example):


2. By opening the EPP client -> Going to the Settings tab -> Pressing CTRL + ALT + I or Command + Options + I -> You should see the IP/FQDN/DNS to which the EPP client communicates.

3. In the EPP UI, by going to System Configuration -> Client Software:

We don't host our server so that's not what I'm concerned about.  Do you have a list of URLs/FQDNs that the endpoint agents need to communicate with?

Hi Josh,

Please find below the ports that are usually used by the EPP server:
 
1. 443: Server communicates with the clients through this port(inbound should be enough).
 
2. 80: The EPP server uses port 80 for Live Update feature(liveupdate.endpointprotector.com / IP: 178.63.3.86) in order to download server patches. The Live Update is not needed to be kept open as the server doesn't automatically update(needs to be done manually by admins) and we also can provide Offline Patches for the EPP server versions.
 
3. 22: The ssh port 22 is also used on EPP server side but only by us, the support team, in case a support intervention is required.
 
4. 389: For Active Directory the default port 389.

I am not aware of any other exceptions that need to be made in the firewall besides these ones.

I think we may have an issue with content filtering on our VPN firewall to be honest.  Do you have a list of URLs/IPs that we can whitelist to ensure EPP services aren't being blocked?

Server upgrade went well but we're having a very difficult time deploying the hotfixed agent to our windows laptops (macbooks were done without incident). Have you received any other reports about Windows agents failing to upgrade?

Thanks, you can go ahead and close this out.  We've made decent progress on
the deployments since yesterday but we'll reach out if anything changes.
