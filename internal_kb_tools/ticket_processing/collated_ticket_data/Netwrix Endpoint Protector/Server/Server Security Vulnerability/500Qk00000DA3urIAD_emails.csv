Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:

For the access on the platform we asked for you to contact the person that sent you the email and ask them to check if you account is associated + also send them some screenshots of what you receive on your end when you cannot access it.

We have also applied the hotfix on the EPP server side and the Offline client patch. We checked and the logs were coming in.

We also started an upgrade job for the macOS clients so we also cover the client side hotfix.

We are closing this ticket. If something comes up please let me know and we will take a look together.
