The solution in the advisory says to update the server and then deploy the relevant agent on all endpoints, but there have been a couple of different agent versions for this server version. All of our endpoints are on 6.0.1.6 or above.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","","11.0","Closed - Resolved","Hughes Federal Credit Union","Zach Metz","2024-06-27T20:14:55.000Z","2024-07-08T19:12:50.000Z"
