@Dane Evans - I think I find this spurious. Clearly we cannot prevent access to the file since the javascript must be executed by the browser. Anyone can download it and hash it and compare against known versions, so removing the version number from the file name is meaningless. Thoughts?

@Gerrit Lansing I'm assuming they're also expecting that we rewrite the HTTP response code as well as the resultant error page. I don't like this idea. For basic 40X responses that's probably not going to cause huge issues, but browsers often behave differently with less-common response codes. You could dig into selectively rewriting these codes, but this is all security-through-obscurity and makes debugging and troubleshooting valid use of the system fraught with esoteric quirks.

I'd be keen to ask them to provide an example that results in a vulnerability. E.g. something like user/account enumeration via URLs providing different responses. If we're currently showing 401/403 for unauthenticated/unauthorized pages, then I don't see an issue with this beyond checking for technology-specific URLs at the recon stage for automated scanners.

@Krzysztof Staszalek @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan A few thoughts on this --

	 - 	We should remove the old code path regarding the setup wizard and have the page by default load the client software.
	 - 	We should add a configuration option (disabled by default) to allow unauthenticated client downloads which enables the software download view.

It is not technically possible to remove the content of the jquery-3.4.1.min.js file, as doing so would break the application. Removing the version from the filename serves no material purpose as the version can be derived through other means. We do not consider this a vulnerability.

@Gerrit Lansing @Bogdan-Cosmin Melinte

I have done some tests and have prepared some documention for this. Please let me know if this suffices or I should add something in addition:

1. Become root:

sudo su

2. Backup /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf file:

cp -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf /home/epproot/epp.nginx.conf.orig

3. Edit /etc/nginx/sites/enabled/epp.nginx.conf

vim /etc/nginx/sites/enabled/epp.nginx.conf

Comment the following lines like this:

    #error_page 403 /error403.html;
    #    location = /error403.html {
    #       allow all;
    #       internal;
    #

Separately, comment also this line like this:

    #error_page 495 =401 /ws-void/webservice.php;

Below this last line add these lines:

    error_page 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 421 422 423 424 425 426 428 429 431 451 =400 /error_page.html;
    error_page 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 510 511 =500 /error_page.html;

Save the file ( Type :wq and then press Enter in vim )

4. Create the error_page.html file:

cd /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/web
vim error_page.html

Add these lines to the file:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>An error has occurred</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>An error has occurred</h1>
  </body>
</html>

Save the file ( Type :wq and then press Enter in vim )

5. Adjust the ownership/rights of the same file:

chmod 755 error_page.html
chown www-data:www-data error_page.html

6. Test nginx config:

nginx -t

7. If test went fine, run:

service nginx restart

8. Test new config:

https://EPP_IP_ADDRESS/wstats
https://EPP_IP_ADDRESS/xyz

Note: Please take into account that this is a custom change that may eventually get annuled by an EPP Server version update.

Cososys Koreea confirms that we can close the ticket and the escalation tickets as the 3 proposals were accepted by Kospo:

1)We have previously said that you as our partner or the customer should be able to remove the client.php and robots.txt files, as the Endpoint Protector Server is in an air-gapped network and as per this we will not be able to connect. --> Accepted 

2)We have attached a procedure for modifying the handling of HTTP error pages. You or the customer needs to follow this procedure --> Leave it as is. I was convinced that this modification could potentially cause problems and decided to stick with it as is.

3)The out-of-date jQuery library will be resolved in a future release. The Security team is working with PM to see if this can be prioritized and we are aiming to introduce this in 5942 version of the product. --> Accepted, They will wait 5.9.4.2. offline patch
