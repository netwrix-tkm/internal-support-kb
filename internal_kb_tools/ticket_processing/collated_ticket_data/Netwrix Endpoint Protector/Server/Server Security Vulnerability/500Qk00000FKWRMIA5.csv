"500Qk00000FKWRMIA5","00420036","Support Ticket","Can you please ensure and confirm back that the appropriate patches and mitigations are in place","Good day,

Can you please confirm that all appropriate mitigations and patches have been applied to <a href='https://35ylwgp.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>35ylwgp.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a> as it relates to ADV-2024-002 and any other known vulnerabilities?

I've tried to previously apply hotfix 1.1 and it says it completed but continues to show in the list for available updates.

Thank you in advance,
Andrew","","","","Closing ticket as we confirmed the patches were installed on the server.","","Zachary Roy","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Security Vulnerability","","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Duane Morris LLP","Andrew Singer","2024-09-04T18:24:06.000Z","2024-09-17T17:31:34.000Z"
