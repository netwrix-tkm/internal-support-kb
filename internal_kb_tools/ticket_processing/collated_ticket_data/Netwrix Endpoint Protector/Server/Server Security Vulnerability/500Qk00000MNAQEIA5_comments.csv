Hi everyone, 

Setting frame-ancestors to 'none' will block certain resources from loading, particularly content embedded within <iframe>, <embed>, and <object> elements.
Affected areas:

	 - 	  Header and  Footer -  images are loaded inside <object> elements
	 - 	  Download of shadowed resources - These are loaded inside a hidden <iframe> element.



To implement frame-ancestors: 'none', code changes will be required.
If no changes are made to the code, an alternative solution would be to set frame-ancestors to 'self'.


Regards,
Augustina

frame-ancestors: 'self' is acceptable

Customer's Current Focus: The customer has shifted their focus towards the ""Content-Security-Policy"" headers. They suggest using Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only instead, to ensure it doesn't interfere with EPP operation. The frame-ancestors: 'none' should be included in this Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only, which they see as essential before closure.
 
Proposed Changes: The customer is interested in seeing if one of the headers can be set to read-only. They’ve agreed on the frame-ancestors configuration, as outlined previously, and will ask customer if setting yhe frame-ancestors to 'self' will work  for them 

Is implementing Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only possible based on their request?","005Qk000002lX5pIAE","2025-03-17T15:43:02.000Z","2025-03-17T15:43:02.000Z","false","false"

Hi Ramon,

Yes, it is possible to change the ""Content-Security-Policy"" to ""Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only"".

For frame-ancestors directive, please inform the customer that it's not possible to set it to 'none'.
Setting it to none, will block specific resources from loading and some functionalities will stop working.

A solution will be to set it to ""self"".

To change/adjust the Nginx directives please follow the next steps:


	 - 	backup the original nginx config file

	 - 	cp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf{,.orig}
	 - 	edit the nginx config file:

	 - 	vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf

	 - 	Locate the Content-Security-Policy and change it with Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only
	 - 	add frame-ancestors: 'self'; (see the below example where it should be added)
	 - 	The new here should look like this:

	 - 	

--- CODE ---add_header Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only ""default-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-ancestors 'self'; worker-src blob:; child-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' *.amazonaws.com; img-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' data:;"" ;--- CODE ---

	 - 	save the file
	 - 	check if the syntax is ok

	 - 	nginx -t

	 - 	if an error is returned, review again the changed settings until no mistake is returned
	 - 	restart the nginx service

	 - 	service nginx restart


Regards,
Augustina
