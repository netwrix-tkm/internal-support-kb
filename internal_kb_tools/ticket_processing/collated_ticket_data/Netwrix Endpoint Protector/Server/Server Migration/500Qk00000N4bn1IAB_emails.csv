Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	
	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	
	
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	
	
	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	
	
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.
	


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	
	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
	
	
	Download the following three patches:

	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz
		EPP5910 Offline Patch: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz
		EPP5920 Offline Patch: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz
	
	
	
	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	
	
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	
	
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	
	
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	
	
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	
	
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	
	
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.
	



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We are on server version 5.9.4.1, installed on 23 Jan 2025.

We would host the VM in our azure tenant.

Is there a recommended azure template/machine type for the EPP server? Is the image file to create the server different for Azure vs. a traditional hypervisor like VMware?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.

     *   EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20qjaRBx6$>: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20qjaRBx6$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.

  1.

     *   EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20qjaRBx6$>: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20qjaRBx6$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent: schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment
 


	Documentation
	V 5.9.4
	Host Configuration

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	
	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	
	
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	
	
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	
	
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	
	
	Performance – select Standard performance
	
	
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
	


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.


Please let me know if you have further questions.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 
Launching VM for Azure Deployment
 


	Documentation
	V 5.9.4
	Host Configuration
	Administration

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	
	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	
	
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	
	
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	
	
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	
	
	Performance – select Standard performance
	
	
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
	


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is  schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]

		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  *   Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  *   Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  *   Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  *   Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  *   Performance – select Standard performance
  *   Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

 


	Documentation [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Administration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]



	Last UpdatedFeb 28, 2025

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmC3ojcTo$>, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both? 

Please let me know.

Thank you.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

Thank you.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>
  2.  Download the following three patches:

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent: schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent: schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both?

Please let me know.

Thank you.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]



	Last UpdatedFeb 28, 2025

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent:  schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both?

Please let me know.

Thank you.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

 

Thanks!

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

 


	Documentation [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Administration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]



	Last UpdatedFeb 28, 2025

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent:  schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both? 

Please let me know.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent: schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmC3ojcTo$>

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

  1.

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

We’ve decided that we will move forward with the Azure VM. We have allowed access to a storage blob. This access will be valid until the end of this week. Will you please copy the image to this location?

 

Please see the attached email for specifics.

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

I’m on the call, however, the server is no longer throwing that error. I am logged in to the GUI and am importing the backup from the other system.

Hello Jeff,

Are you able to access the EndPoint Protector UI using the web interface and the default username and password (root/epp2011)? You can migrate the settings from your old EPP server over to the new one once you are able to access the EPP UI.

Please let me know your available days and times this week or next to schedule a remote session, if you continue to have problems accessing EPP through the web interface using this default username and password.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both?

Please let me know.

Thank you.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent:  schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent:  schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

We’ve decided that we will move forward with the Azure VM. We have allowed access to a storage blob. This access will be valid until the end of this week. Will you please copy the image to this location?

Please see the attached email for specifics.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Unfortunately, you can not restore a 5.9.4.1 config to a 5.9.4.0 server unless you have a snapshot. If you have the new server installed, you can follow the below steps:

1. Activate the 30 day trial license on that server. 
2. Bring both servers to the latest EPP server version 5.9.4.1(If the old server was on 5.9.4.1, and new server is on 5.9.4.0 - upgrade the new server to 5.9.4.1).
3. Migrate from the old server to the new server(the Sysbackup V2 needs to be done on the exact same server version as the server version on which it will be imported on).
4. Once the new EPP server has finished with the migration/import process, it will also import the license file from the old EPP server.

Please let me know if you have further questions. I will end this Zoom session now.

Thank you.

That depends 😊 I’m trying to update from 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1 so that I can restore my config, but it says it will not update without a license. Can I restore a 5.9.4.1 config to a 5.9.4.0 server?

I’m on the call, however, the server is no longer throwing that error. I am logged in to the GUI and am importing the backup from the other system.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

 


	Documentation [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Host Configuration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	Administration [helpcenter.netwrix.com]
	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]



	Last UpdatedFeb 28, 2025

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Are you able to access the EndPoint Protector UI using the web interface and the default username and password (root/epp2011)? You can migrate the settings from your old EPP server over to the new one once you are able to access the EPP UI.

Please let me know your available days and times this week or next to schedule a remote session, if you continue to have problems accessing EPP through the web interface using this default username and password.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config.

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both?

Please let me know.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

Hello Jeff,

I got back from my team and they would need the Azure ID or Azure subscription number in order to proceed with the Azure image request not the email you sent:  schemj@cpchem.com.

Please go to following link and refer to Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Please let me know if a time between this time window is good time to schedule another remote session with you.

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Are you able to access the EndPoint Protector UI using the web interface and the default username and password (root/epp2011)? You can migrate the settings from your old EPP server over to the new one once you are able to access the EPP UI.

Please let me know your available days and times this week or next to schedule a remote session, if you continue to have problems accessing EPP through the web interface using this default username and password.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please let us know.

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/portal.azure.com/*home__;Iw!!PZLOGLA!FuRbzu5bUznvqyYbx8CqA47vm8zEFGUWyLwGBKTIqOGHwYeLwJgsIiROS2GPMbxXrBLfEXGpRKo3NPavRsgw$>;

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:

  1.  Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
  2.  Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
  3.  Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
  4.  Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
  5.  Performance – select Standard performance
  6.  Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Step 4 – Click Review + create;

[Creating a storage account]

Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);

[Naming the container]

Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;

[Configuring the SAS token]

Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com<mailto:schemj@cpchem.com>. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf__;!!PZLOGLA!A2XQvz2EyofI0IaaBOSscIhCJPDA2i4OvwY5WGpg9ESKVOS_aIm-PMXbz88aHz4l9bSobQoZEH-DmCU7uENp$>

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:

  1.  Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
  2.  Is there a specific template needed for Azure?

     *   Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?

  1.  Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
  2.  Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.

Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:

  1.  Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email__;!!PZLOGLA!BzKjdwBSD6O5Hesy6t8zA1OjfmwPDs-W2Z91iVuNOcPrExvgcoMRxJGDup5PfHW3HJHUeQaHwm_20iiWz4Tx$>

  1.  Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
  2.  Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
  3.  From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
  4.  Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
  5.  Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
  6.  Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
  7.  Create a snapshot for redundancy.

  1.  Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.

Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.

Hello Jeff,

When would you be available to schedule a remote session tomorrow? I currently have the available times from 11 AM to 2 PM CST. Please let me know if a time between this time window is good time to schedule another remote session with you. I will need to access the backend of the new EPP server and change the maximum upload size of files on the EPP UI.

Hello Jeff,

Are you able to access the EndPoint Protector UI using the web interface and the default username and password (root/epp2011)? You can migrate the settings from your old EPP server over to the new one once you are able to access the EPP UI.

Please let me know your available days and times this week or next to schedule a remote session, if you continue to have problems accessing EPP through the web interface using this default username and password.

Thank you.

We have the VM created. How do I access the console of the VM in azure, since it is not a windows VM, bastion RDP will not work. Is everything configured via SSH? If so, what are the default credentials? Or is everything configured via the web interface? What are the default credentials for that?

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeff,

I hope you’re doing well. Our DevOps team has reviewed your inquiry and provided the following feedback:

“I believe the customer’s question is not relevant here, because the image copying process occurs Azure-to-Azure—specifically from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account—rather than involving any IP addresses from our internal Romanian office.”

Hello Jeff,

As per the steps from the link provided: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm, we would need the Blob SAS URL from step 10. We will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.
 

Launching VM for Azure Deployment

	V 5.9.4 [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

	CoSoSys [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

To have access to the Virtual Machine, contact your Endpoint Protector Representative and provide information such as the access keys to a Container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

NOTE: We will upload the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your Container as soon as possible. Once this step is done, we advise regenerating the access key.

Creating the Storage Account and Container

This part of the process is similar to creating any other Storage Account and Container on Azure. If you are already familiar with it or have created a dedicated Container already, proceed to the next steps.

To obtain the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine, you need to create a dedicated Storage account / Container, following these steps:

Step 1 – Open the Azure portal [portal.azure.com];

Step 2 – Go to Storage accounts and click +Create;

Step 3 – To create a storage account, provide the following information:


	Subscription – select Pay-As-You-Go
	Resource group – select a group from the available list or create a new one
	Storage account name – add a name for the storage account
	Region – select the nearest the location of the computers that will be protected by Endpoint Protector
	Performance – select Standard performance
	Redundancy – select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)


Step 4 – Click Review + create;



Step 5 – Go to Storage accounts and click the newly created account;

Step 6 – Go to Containers and click +Container;

Step 7 – Give the container the same name as you did to the storage account and for the Public access level select Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs);



Step 8 – Select the container you created, and then click Shared access tokens.

CAUTION: Make sure you are creating a token on the container level, not the storage account!

Step 9 – Configure the SAS token with Create, Write and Add Permissions with a 5-day window to allow the Netwrix team to copy the image;



Step 10 – Copy the Blob SAS URL and send it to Netwrix.

NOTE: Netwrix will copy the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to your storage account and notify you when the process is over.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

My Azure ID is schemj@cpchem.com. It only looks like an email address. If you’re referring to some aspect of the VM for a reference number, we have not yet created the VM. Is there not an image I can download? Is the image not in the Azure catalog? This is confusing.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/VirtualMachine.htm [helpcenter.netwrix.com]

I would need from you the Blob SAS URL from step 10. Will you please provide this URL?

Also, please refer to the Intune Deployment guide:

https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf [endpointprotector.com]

If you go into System Configuration > Client Software and change the Server IP and generate a .msi package, when you run the package on the machine using the EPP agent software, it will use the IP address you set on that .msi package to communicate with the EPP appliance,

Please let me know if this helps and please provide the Blob SAS URL.

Thank you.

I’m afraid our workstations are not AD joined, so a GPO will not work for us. Our workstations are windows 11 and are Azure joined, managed in Intune. I just need to know where to update the IP address of the server in the agent config. Please provide the registry key or keys that need to be updated and the path and name of any configuration file on the client that contains the server IP.

Thanks,

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the need to change the IP address of the Endpoint Protector (EPP) server in the agent configuration.

To provide you with the most accurate instructions, could you please confirm whether you need to update the server IP address on an EPP agent running on Windows or macOS or both? 

Please let me know.

Thank you.

We’ll also need to change the IP of the server in the agent config. Can you tell me where we need to make that change?

Hello Jeff,

Could you please confirm that your current Endpoint Protector version is 5.9.2.0?

To address your questions:


	Does Endpoint Protector support Nutanix? No.
	Is there a specific template needed for Azure?



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Would you prefer Netwrix to host the EPP Appliance, or would you host it on Azure yourself?
	
	



	Can the EPP run on a Windows server? It can only run on Hyper-V within a Windows server.
	Is configuration migration as simple as creating a backup and restoring it on the new server? No, both the old Endpoint Protector database and the new one must match.


Given that you are at EPP version 5.9.2.0, as indicated in your ticket, you will need to download the 5.8.1.0 image, install it on a VM, and upgrade it to 5.9.2.0 before migrating the old database to the new one.

Steps to Create a New EPP Appliance and Migrate the Old Database:


	Visit the website and download the virtual appliance (Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0):
	https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email [endpointprotector.com]
	Download the following three patches:



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		EPP5900 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500615900.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5910 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500625910.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
		EPP5920 Offline Patch [download.endpointprotector.com]: https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500635920.tar.gz [download.endpointprotector.com]
	
	



	Create a new EPP Appliance image at version 5.8.1.0, then apply patches EPP5900, EPP5910, and EPP5920 sequentially.
	Verify that the EPP Appliance is updated to version 5.9.2.0 and create a snapshot.
	From the old EPP Appliance, at version 5.9.2.0, create a backup/backupv2/db dump.
	Transfer the backup/dump to the new Appliance.
	Import the backup/dump into the new Appliance.
	Ensure the new EPP Appliance is communicating with computers.
	Create a snapshot for redundancy.



	Can we restore a Linux config backup on a Windows server? If this refers to the EPP Appliance database, yes, as described above.


Please let me know if you have any further questions and provide responses to my queries to offer you the best guidance.

Thank you.
