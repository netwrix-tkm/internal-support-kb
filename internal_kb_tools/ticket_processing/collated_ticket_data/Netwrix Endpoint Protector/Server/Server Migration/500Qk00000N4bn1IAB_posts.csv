The vmware infrastructure we are using will not be available in the new datacenter. Does endpointprotector support Nutanix? Another option we have is to move it to Azure. Is there a specific template we need to use for Azure? Can this run on a Windows server? If we deploy a new server, is the config migration as simple as creating a backup and then restoring that backup on the new server? Can we restore a linux config backup on a windows server?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-18T20:01:37.000Z"
