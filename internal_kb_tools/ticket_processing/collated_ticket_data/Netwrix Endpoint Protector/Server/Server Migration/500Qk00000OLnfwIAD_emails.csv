Thank you for reaching out!!

If you are migrating the existing EPP VM to another AWS account, that means you will have to create a new EPP VM and import the backup from the old one. 
Before proceeding with any steps please take a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment of the existing machine.

In order to import the backup, you will have to create a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP UI, download it and save the key. Please keep in mind that this should be imported in the new EPP VM that has the same version, so if the existing one have the 5.9.4.0 version the new one should have the same one. 

Once the Backup is downloaded, you can turn of the old machine and start the new one.If you can use the same IP as the old machine, then the existing endpoints will communicate with the new server once is up and running.

If you cannot take the same IP as the old one, please configure the new EPP VM network and then start it on the browser. 

Navigate to the browser and complete the required fields and then you can import the System backup V2  under the System Maintenance -> System Backup V2 . 

If the IP is a new one then, we recommend you to use our change IP tool, to change the IP of the server that is assigned to the machines. 
This tool can be used manually on one machine at the time or it can be included in a script to be deployed on all endpoints. 

We can schedule a remote session tomorrow to assist you with the migration, could you please share with us your availability ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
