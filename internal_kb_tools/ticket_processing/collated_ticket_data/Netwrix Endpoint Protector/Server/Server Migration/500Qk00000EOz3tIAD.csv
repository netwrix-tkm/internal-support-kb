our CSM told us to migrate to a new server instance (Ubuntu 18 > 22). 

Therefore we followed the CSM's notes and created a system backup v2 with filesize 213 MB.

Now, we are not able to import this file on the newly installed server. After the confirmation  of the import code the assistant closes and the page show's 'Request Entity Too Large'.

Please tell us how to solve this problem.
Thanks in advance and kind regards
