The server is deployed, the network configuration too.  I don't have login credentials, it didn't ask for them during installation process.

Hi David,

Based on the VM type that you are using if you scroll down the page you will see which image is compatible with it.


After identifying the image type please select the 5.9.4.0 EPP server version for it and download it.

Once downloaded the image can be imported/uploaded to the VM.

Hi David,

My colleague Eduard is OOO this week.

Please find below the download links for the latest EPP server images for VM's:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Please find the attached our documentation on how to exclude EPP(EPP Client Security Application Exclusions).

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Eduard.

 

We have accessed the server and checked that the configuration is active.

 

We need a link to download the VMware vSphere version and an installation guide.

 

Once we have the server installed, we set a configuration date.

 

Please, we also need exclusions list to add in our Kaspersky EndPoint.

Hi David,

Stefania informed me that you should now have access to the test server. Can you please check and confirm?
If you do, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session to migrate the settings.

Thank you,

Hi David,

There is no need to send the user and password as the migration will be done in a remote session and you will be in charge as I will instruct you where to go. It is an easy process.
@Stefania, can we extend the demo license on the mentioned instance so we can create a system backup v2?

Hi,

We can do a migration of the settings as long as the old test server has not been decommissioned. Do you know who the account manager is so I can include them here and see?

Good morning.

We have activated an external access to our server so that you can 
export the configuration that previously existed on your server. 
Currently the user is not active, let me know when it would be 
convenient for you to establish a call through teams for it. This week 
we could establish the meeting from 14:10 hours to 15 hours. Next week I 
would have to look at the schedule. I look forward to your availability.

Steps to access the server:

1.- Access to the link ""aru.gdaservicios.es"". Accept the certificate and 
it will show you the login screen.

2.- You can access with the user: unetwrix and password:N3twr1x25! and 
you should see the following screen

3.- Click on the link of the equipment and you must download and install 
the launcher of pulse secure, to show the window of connection to the 
equipment by rdp. Once installed, click again and the login window will 
appear.

4.- Indicate in user: gdaunetwrix and password: to access the system.

5.- Here you will be inside a computer ready to access the server, where 
you will only have to click on the enabled icon on the desktop.

Best Regards.

The server is deployed, the network configuration too.  I don't have login credentials, it didn't ask for them during installation process.

Hi David,

Based on the VM type that you are using if you scroll down the page you will see which image is compatible with it.


After identifying the image type please select the 5.9.4.0 EPP server version for it and download it.

Once downloaded the image can be imported/uploaded to the VM.

Hi David,

My colleague Eduard is OOO this week.

Please find below the download links for the latest EPP server images for VM's:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Please find the attached our documentation on how to exclude EPP(EPP Client Security Application Exclusions).

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Eduard.

 

We have accessed the server and checked that the configuration is active.

 

We need a link to download the VMware vSphere version and an installation guide.

 

Once we have the server installed, we set a configuration date.

 

Please, we also need exclusions list to add in our Kaspersky EndPoint.

Hi David,

Stefania informed me that you should now have access to the test server. Can you please check and confirm?
If you do, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session to migrate the settings.

Thank you,

Hi David,

There is no need to send the user and password as the migration will be done in a remote session and you will be in charge as I will instruct you where to go. It is an easy process.
@Stefania, can we extend the demo license on the mentioned instance so we can create a system backup v2?

Thank you,

Hi,

We can do a migration of the settings as long as the old test server has not been decommissioned. Do you know who the account manager is so I can include them here and see?

Good morning.

We have activated an external access to our server so that you can export the configuration that previously existed on your server. Currently the user is not active, let me know when it would be convenient for you to establish a call through teams for it. This week we could establish the meeting from 14:10 hours to 15 hours. Next week I would have to look at the schedule. I look forward to your availability.

Steps to access the server:


1.- Access to the link “aru.gdaservicios.es”. Accept the certificate and it will show you the login screen.


2.- You can access with the user: unetwrix and password:N3twr1x25! and you should see the following screen



3.- Click on the link of the equipment and you must download and install the launcher of pulse secure, to show the window of connection to the equipment by rdp. Once installed, click again and the login window will appear.



4.- Indicate in user: gdaunetwrix and password: to access the system.


5.- Here you will be inside a computer ready to access the server, where you will only have to click on the enabled icon on the desktop.



Best Regards.

The server is deployed, the network configuration too.  I don't have login credentials, it didn't ask for them during installation process.

Hi David,

Based on the VM type that you are using if you scroll down the page you will see which image is compatible with it.


After identifying the image type please select the 5.9.4.0 EPP server version for it and download it.

Once downloaded the image can be imported/uploaded to the VM.

Hi David,

My colleague Eduard is OOO this week.

Please find below the download links for the latest EPP server images for VM's:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Please find the attached our documentation on how to exclude EPP(EPP Client Security Application Exclusions).

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Eduard.

 

We have accessed the server and checked that the configuration is active.

 

We need a link to download the VMware vSphere version and an installation guide.

 

Once we have the server installed, we set a configuration date.

 

Please, we also need exclusions list to add in our Kaspersky EndPoint.

Hi David,

Stefania informed me that you should now have access to the test server. Can you please check and confirm?
If you do, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session to migrate the settings.

Thank you,

Hi David,

There is no need to send the user and password as the migration will be done in a remote session and you will be in charge as I will instruct you where to go. It is an easy process.
@Stefania, can we extend the demo license on the mentioned instance so we can create a system backup v2?

Thank you,

Hi,

We can do a migration of the settings as long as the old test server has not been decommissioned. Do you know who the account manager is so I can include them here and see?

Good morning.

We have activated an external access to our server so that you can export the configuration that previously existed on your server. Currently the user is not active, let me know when it would be convenient for you to establish a call through teams for it. This week we could establish the meeting from 14:10 hours to 15 hours. Next week I would have to look at the schedule. I look forward to your availability.

Steps to access the server:


1.- Access to the link “aru.gdaservicios.es”. Accept the certificate and it will show you the login screen.


2.- You can access with the user: unetwrix and password:N3twr1x25! and you should see the following screen



3.- Click on the link of the equipment and you must download and install the launcher of pulse secure, to show the window of connection to the equipment by rdp. Once installed, click again and the login window will appear.



4.- Indicate in user: gdaunetwrix and password: to access the system.


5.- Here you will be inside a computer ready to access the server, where you will only have to click on the enabled icon on the desktop.



Best Regards.

Hi David,

Based on the VM type that you are using if you scroll down the page you will see which image is compatible with it.


After identifying the image type please select the 5.9.4.0 EPP server version for it and download it.

Once downloaded the image can be imported/uploaded to the VM.

Hi David,

My colleague Eduard is OOO this week.

Please find below the download links for the latest EPP server images for VM's:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Please find the attached our documentation on how to exclude EPP(EPP Client Security Application Exclusions).

Eduard.

 

We have accessed the server and checked that the configuration is active.

 

We need a link to download the VMware vSphere version and an installation guide.

 

Once we have the server installed, we set a configuration date.

 

Please, we also need exclusions list to add in our Kaspersky EndPoint.

Hi David,

Stefania informed me that you should now have access to the test server. Can you please check and confirm?
If you do, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session to migrate the settings.

Thank you,

Hi David,

There is no need to send the user and password as the migration will be done in a remote session and you will be in charge as I will instruct you where to go. It is an easy process.
@Stefania, can we extend the demo license on the mentioned instance so we can create a system backup v2?

Thank you,

We can do a migration of the settings as long as the old test server has not been decommissioned. Do you know who the account manager is so I can include them here and see?

Hi David,

My colleague Eduard is OOO this week.

Please find below the download links for the latest EPP server images for VM's:

Please find the attached our documentation on how to exclude EPP(EPP Client Security Application Exclusions).

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Eduard.

 

We have accessed the server and checked that the configuration is active.

 

We need a link to download the VMware vSphere version and an installation guide.

 

Once we have the server installed, we set a configuration date.

 

Please, we also need exclusions list to add in our Kaspersky EndPoint.

Hi David,

Stefania informed me that you should now have access to the test server. Can you please check and confirm?
If you do, let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session to migrate the settings.

Thank you,

Hi David,

There is no need to send the user and password as the migration will be done in a remote session and you will be in charge as I will instruct you where to go. It is an easy process.
@Stefania, can we extend the demo license on the mentioned instance so we can create a system backup v2?

Thank you,

Hi,

We can do a migration of the settings as long as the old test server has not been decommissioned. Do you know who the account manager is so I can include them here and see?
