i would like to request your support for transfering the Logs (History) and tuning the new Server.
I have already setup the new EPP-Server with a temp. IP and have prepared the actual System by backup up the old Logs (>4 Months).
Additionally it would kind if you could tune the new EPP-Server if necessary.
Many thanks and kind Regards,
Gerrit","","","","Performed the mysql migration, when changing the IP, this was not changed, we needed to perform this manually in the setup.nginx.conf file.
I performed an optimization of the environment after that.","","Alin Anca","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Migration","","","4.9","Closed - Resolved","Kassen√§rztliche Vereinigung Nordrhein","Gerrit Beyken","2024-12-18T13:40:32.000Z","2024-12-23T10:32:56.000Z"
