Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Nadine told me that she sent you a quote a few days ago for hosting the EPP server on our AWS instance.
Regarding the migration, do you want to migrate the logs as well, or only the configurations, computers, users etc.?

Hi,

Thank you for your quick response on this, it's very appreciated.

I know that our current license already gives us the possibility to migrate to the Cloud. Please, confirm that the license also gives us the possibility to be hosted by you without any additional costs.

Also, is it possible to do this migration while preserving/transferring the current configuration we have on-premise?

What do we need to start Deploying/Migrating?


Thank you,

I will reach out to the DevOps team to create the AMI for you, but I need to know first if it's ok for the server to be on Ubuntu 22.04, and what your current server version is - you can check that on the right bottom corner on the console.
Regarding the migration process, you can activate a trial license once you start up the AWS server, and when we import the backup from the old server, the licenses will also be imported.
Before the migration, we will need to make sure both servers are on the same version.

Hello Botond

Thank you for the follow-up and the migration plan that will help us import the backup/set up.
To answer the question, Yes, an Ubuntu 22.04 AMI would be perfect for me and My current server version is: 5.9.4.0

Hi Jean,

I will reach out to the DevOps team to create the AMI for you, but I need to know first if it's ok for the server to be on Ubuntu 22.04, and what your current server version is - you can check that on the right bottom corner on the console.
Regarding the migration process, you can activate a trial license once you start up the AWS server, and when we import the backup from the old server, the licenses will also be imported.
Before the migration, we will need to make sure both servers are on the same version.

Hi Jean,

I reached out internally for the AMI and I will let you know as soon as I have any updates.
I also asked about the licensing of the 2 servers while the migration is happening.

Thank you for the feedback,

We have indeed had an email exchange with Nadine about this and she sent us a very useful document to move forward in our process.

We do not want to use your EC2 to host the instance, we will use ours.
What we want is for you to share the Endpoint Protector AMI with us.

Here is the information to do the sharing:

  *
AWS Account: 091941582492
  *
Region: ca-central-1

To answer the question about what we want to preserve, it is the configurations, computers, users etc, as much as possible.

IMPORTANT: Please confirm that our license key will work with both servers during the migration process.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Nadine told me that she sent you a quote a few days ago for hosting the EPP server on our AWS instance.
Regarding the migration, do you want to migrate the logs as well, or only the configurations, computers, users etc.?

Hi,

Thank you for your quick response on this, it's very appreciated.

I know that our current license already gives us the possibility to migrate to the Cloud. Please, confirm that the license also gives us the possibility to be hosted by you without any additional costs.

Also, is it possible to do this migration while preserving/transferring the current configuration we have on-premise?

What do we need to start Deploying/Migrating?


Thank you,

Hello Botond

 

Thank you for the follow-up and the migration plan that will help us import the backup/set up.

To answer the question, Yes, an Ubuntu 22.04 AMI would be perfect for me and My current server version is: 5.9.4.0

Hi Jean,

I will reach out to the DevOps team to create the AMI for you, but I need to know first if it's ok for the server to be on Ubuntu 22.04, and what your current server version is - you can check that on the right bottom corner on the console.
Regarding the migration process, you can activate a trial license once you start up the AWS server, and when we import the backup from the old server, the licenses will also be imported.
Before the migration, we will need to make sure both servers are on the same version.

Hi Jean,

I reached out internally for the AMI and I will let you know as soon as I have any updates.
I also asked about the licensing of the 2 servers while the migration is happening.

Thank you for the feedback,

 

We have indeed had an email exchange with Nadine about this and she sent us a very useful document to move forward in our process.

 

We do not want to use your EC2 to host the instance, we will use ours.

What we want is for you to share the Endpoint Protector AMI with us.

 

Here is the information to do the sharing:


	
	AWS Account: 091941582492
	
	
	Region: ca-central-1
	


To answer the question about what we want to preserve, it is the configurations, computers, users etc, as much as possible.

 

IMPORTANT: Please confirm that our license key will work with both servers during the migration process.

 

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Nadine told me that she sent you a quote a few days ago for hosting the EPP server on our AWS instance.
Regarding the migration, do you want to migrate the logs as well, or only the configurations, computers, users etc.?

Hi,

 

Thank you for your quick response on this, it's very appreciated.

 

I know that our current license already gives us the possibility to migrate to the Cloud. Please, confirm that the license also gives us the possibility to be hosted by you without any additional costs.

 

Also, is it possible to do this migration while preserving/transferring the current configuration we have on-premise?

 

What do we need to start Deploying/Migrating?

 


Thank you,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Our devops team shared the AMI on your account and you should be able to install the appliance.
Afterwards, we should schedule a remote session to discuss the details.

Hello Botond

Thank you for the follow-up and the migration plan that will help us import the backup/set up.
To answer the question, Yes, an Ubuntu 22.04 AMI would be perfect for me and My current server version is: 5.9.4.0

Hello Botond,

Fantastic, and thanks again for taking care of the process.

 

The AMI is deployed, you can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at any time (Eastern time/Montreal).

Please add Michael Sanford (msanford@stelvio.com) to the meeting.

 

Thank you,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Our devops team shared the AMI on your account and you should be able to install the appliance.
Afterwards, we should schedule a remote session to discuss the details.

Hello Botond

 

Thank you for the follow-up and the migration plan that will help us import the backup/set up.

To answer the question, Yes, an Ubuntu 22.04 AMI would be perfect for me and My current server version is: 5.9.4.0

Hi Jean,

I will reach out to the DevOps team to create the AMI for you, but I need to know first if it's ok for the server to be on Ubuntu 22.04, and what your current server version is - you can check that on the right bottom corner on the console.
Regarding the migration process, you can activate a trial license once you start up the AWS server, and when we import the backup from the old server, the licenses will also be imported.
Before the migration, we will need to make sure both servers are on the same version.

I also asked about the licensing of the 2 servers while the migration is happening.

Thank you for the feedback,

 

We have indeed had an email exchange with Nadine about this and she sent us a very useful document to move forward in our process.

 

We do not want to use your EC2 to host the instance, we will use ours.

What we want is for you to share the Endpoint Protector AMI with us.

 

Here is the information to do the sharing:


	
	AWS Account: 091941582492
	
	
	Region: ca-central-1
	


To answer the question about what we want to preserve, it is the configurations, computers, users etc, as much as possible.

 

IMPORTANT: Please confirm that our license key will work with both servers during the migration process.

 

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Nadine told me that she sent you a quote a few days ago for hosting the EPP server on our AWS instance.
Regarding the migration, do you want to migrate the logs as well, or only the configurations, computers, users etc.?

Hi,

 

Thank you for your quick response on this, it's very appreciated.

 

I know that our current license already gives us the possibility to migrate to the Cloud. Please, confirm that the license also gives us the possibility to be hosted by you without any additional costs.

 

Also, is it possible to do this migration while preserving/transferring the current configuration we have on-premise?

 

What do we need to start Deploying/Migrating?

 


Thank you,

Hi Jean,

Thanks for your patience!
Nadine told me that she sent you a quote a few days ago for hosting the EPP server on our AWS instance.
Regarding the migration, do you want to migrate the logs as well, or only the configurations, computers, users etc.?

Hi,

 

Thank you for your quick response on this, it's very appreciated.

 

I know that our current license already gives us the possibility to migrate to the Cloud. Please, confirm that the license also gives us the possibility to be hosted by you without any additional costs.

 

Also, is it possible to do this migration while preserving/transferring the current configuration we have on-premise?

 

What do we need to start Deploying/Migrating?

 


Thank you,

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!
Just to confirm, do you wish to migrate your server from on premise to an AWS instance hosted by us?

Hi Botond,

Thanks for this quality follow-up, it is really appreciated.
I had a few questions to complete the migration.

First, regarding disk space, the appliance we currently have has a 500GB hard drive and this is what is displayed in the server info page.
[cid:11500b68-3114-4175-8a97-6e3bf07ac5f2]

  *
My understanding is that there is 14G used in total, am I right?
  *
Otherwise is the space used 14+14=28G?

I ask these questions to double check the deployment requirements in order to adjust to our needs and our environment.
Instance type: t2.medium (Can we take another type than this, like t3.medium or t3a.medium, etc)?
EBS Type: gp2 (Can we take another type than this, like gp3 or even Cold HDD)?

EBS Amount: 100GiB

  *
Can we take a smaller size, because we do not use and we will never use all that?
  *
If the answer is no, then can we have an AMI that requires a smaller Requirement please (Ex: 20G if the disk space used is 14G)?


We would like to use our Stelvio Certificate issued by DigiCert with the Endpoint Protector.
Is this the right place to put the certificate (Copy/Paste)?
[cid:b9eabff0-0f0a-444d-a66d-4e0a0efbc0e4]



When changing the certificate:

  *
Is this only used for the Single Sign-On of the Endpoint Protector Console?
  *
When generating an AMI from the EPP console, will this certificate also be integrated into it to send to clients?

Thank you,

Thanks for your patience!
I heard back from the DevOps team, and this is what they answered:

	Instance type: t2.medium (Can we take another type than this, like t3.medium or t3a.medium, etc)?

Instance type is recommended based on the number of endpoints. You can use t3.medium for sure, or similar.
 

	EBS Type: gp2 (Can we take another type than this, like gp3 or even Cold HDD)?

You can switch to gp3, but we would not recommend Cold HDD as it is many times slower.
 

	Can we take a smaller size, because we do not use and we will never use all that? If the answer is no, then can we have an AMI that requires a smaller Requirement please (Ex: 20G if the disk space used is 14G)?

No, our smallest image is 100G (14G is occupied by the OS alone, the rest is needed to store logs)

No, the certificate is not integrated into the clients, since it's used for accessing the web console.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HjVSV:ref


Hi Botond,

 

Thanks for this quality follow-up, it is really appreciated.

I had a few questions to complete the migration.

 

First, regarding disk space, the appliance we currently have has a 500GB hard drive and this is what is displayed in the server info page.




	
	My understanding is that there is 14G used in total, am I right?
	
	
	Otherwise is the space used 14+14=28G ?
	


I ask these questions to double check the deployment requirements in order to adjust to our needs and our environment.

Instance type: t2.medium (Can we take another type than this, like t3.medium or t3a.medium, etc)?

EBS Type: gp2 (Can we take another type than this, like gp3 or even Cold HDD)?

 

EBS Amount: 100GiB


	
	Can we take a smaller size, because we do not use and we will never use all that?
	
	
	If the answer is no, then can we have an AMI that requires a smaller Requirement please (Ex: 20G if the disk space used is 14G)?
	


 

 

We would like to use our Stelvio Certificate issued by DigiCert with the Endpoint Protector.

Is this the right place to put the certificate (Copy/Paste)?



 

 

 

When changing the certificate:


	
	Is this only used for the Single Sign-On of the Endpoint Protector Console?
	




 


	
	When generating an MSI from the EPP console, will this certificate also be integrated into it to send to clients?
	





 

 

Thank you,
