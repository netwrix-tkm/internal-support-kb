Thank you for your email.
I'll list below the stages for completing the migration from the present Endpoint Protector to Azure:
 
1. Obtain and start the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure
Endpoint Protector is not generally available in the Azure Marketplace. CoSoSys team will make available the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to a blob that your team will specifically created for Endpoint Protector.
For this we'll need from you the Blob SAS URL for a blob that was specifically created for Endpoint Protector. 
 
The steps for obtaining the Blob SAS URL are presented in a dedicated User Manual, ""4.2.Create the Storage Account and Container"":
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf
 
CoSoSys will make the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine on version 5.8.1.0. available to the shared blob in 1-2 working days from the moment correct details were received form your team.
 
Once received, you will need to follow the steps presented in chapter ""4.3.Create the disk""  followed by chapter ""4.4.Create the Virtual Machine"". 
 
2. Migration of the settings and policies from the on-premise Endpoint Protector implementation to the fresh Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine 
 
As mentioned above, Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine will be made available on version 5.8.1.0.
For a successful migration the on-premise Endpoint Protector server must have the same version with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
The version of the on-premise Endpoint Protector server is displayed by the web interface, bottom right corner.
 
The migration of policies, settings, configuration and entities from the existing on-premise Endpoint Protector server to the fresh one will be perform via System Maintenance > System Backup v2.
 
The steps for using the are described by chapter ""15.7. System Backup v2"", starting page 183:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
 
Please note that logs, Audit Log Backup files or System Backups will NOT be migrated.
All logs currently stored by the on-premise Endpoint Protector server can be backed up and saved locally via System Maintenance > Audit Log Backup. 
System Backup V2 will migrate all the settings from the old server, including SSO.
 
Once the backup is imported, refresh the page and log in with your old credentials. Also check the license page to make sure they are there.
 
After the import is complete, you can power off the old VM and change the IP of the new VM to the old one. Please do this from the VM's console. This step is needed so that the EPP clients can communicate with the new server.

Please let me know if this points were helpful in what you are trying to achieve or if further assistance is necessary.

Thank you for your reply.
That only means that once you perform the steps and have the new image set up in Azure, that you would need to update that server to the same version (5.9.3.0) in order for the migration to be successful.

Hello,

Thank you for your follow-up.
Please share the Blob SAS URL as mentioned in the previous email, I'll attach it again below:

1. Obtain and start the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure

Endpoint Protector is not generally available in the Azure Marketplace. CoSoSys team will make available the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to a blob that your team will specifically created for Endpoint Protector. For this we'll need from you the Blob SAS URL for a blob that was specifically created for Endpoint Protector.   
The steps for obtaining the Blob SAS URL are presented in a dedicated User Manual, ""4.2.Create the Storage Account and Container"":  https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf  
CoSoSys will make the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine on version 5.8.1.0. available to the shared blob in 1-2 working days from the moment correct details were received form your team.  
Once received, you will need to follow the steps presented in chapter ""4.3.Create the disk""  followed by chapter ""4.4.Create the Virtual Machine"".

Hi Hemant,

Thank you for your email.

As mentioned in my previous email, unfortunately the link is a sensitive
storage explorer and we cannot use this link to upload the image.
The token needs to be created on the container level, not on the storage
account.

Please follow the steps provided in the User Manual in order to obtain  the
Blob SAS URL, starting with page 19,
""4.2.Create the Storage Account and Container"":
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf
All the necessary steps and recommendations are detailed there.

Thank you! Looking forward to hearing from you,
Alexandra

Hello,

Thank you for your follow-up.
Please share the Blob SAS URL as mentioned in the previous email, I'll attach it again below:

1. Obtain and start the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure

Endpoint Protector is not generally available in the Azure Marketplace.

Hello,

Thank you for your follow-up.
Please share the Blob SAS URL as mentioned in the previous email, I'll attach it again below:

1. Obtain and start the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure

CoSoSys team will make available the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to a blob that your team will specifically created for Endpoint Protector. For this we'll need from you the Blob SAS URL for a blob that was specifically created for Endpoint Protector.
The steps for obtaining the Blob SAS URL are presented in a dedicated User Manual, ""4.2.Create the Storage Account and Container"": https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!ng95Ireup73Pwp4q_dP9R1yqrqBNIBayyiNQSC8IG50mzS9UQr2hCiBNTx8JFje654zUKB7kg6LAuw1syEcDlDkNiQ$>
CoSoSys will make the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine on version 5.8.1.0. available to the shared blob in 1-2 working days from the moment correct details were received form your team.

Hello,

Thank you for your follow-up.
Please share the Blob SAS URL as mentioned in the previous email, I'll attach it again below:

1. Obtain and start the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure

Endpoint Protector is not generally available in the Azure Marketplace. CoSoSys team will make available the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine to a blob that your team will specifically created for Endpoint Protector. For this we'll need from you the Blob SAS URL for a blob that was specifically created for Endpoint Protector.
The steps for obtaining the Blob SAS URL are presented in a dedicated User Manual, ""4.2.Create the Storage Account and Container"": https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Cloud_Service_User_Manual_EN.pdf__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!ng95Ireup73Pwp4q_dP9R1yqrqBNIBayyiNQSC8IG50mzS9UQr2hCiBNTx8JFje654zUKB7kg6LAuw1syEcDlDkNiQ$>
CoSoSys will make the Azure Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine on version 5.8.1.0. available to the shared blob in 1-2 working days from the moment correct details were received form your team.
Once received, you will need to follow the steps presented in chapter ""4.3.Create the disk""  followed by chapter ""4.4.Create the Virtual Machine"".

Hello,

Thank you for your follow-up.
Please share the Blob SAS URL as mentioned in the previous email, I'll attach it again below:
