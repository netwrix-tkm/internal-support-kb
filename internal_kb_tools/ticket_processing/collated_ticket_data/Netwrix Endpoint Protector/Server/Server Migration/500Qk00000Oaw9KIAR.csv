Server is very slow.","Server usually throws an error after making a change to policy/rights. Redoing the operation succeeds eventually. We had a lot more CPUs and memory with our on-prem vm than we do in azure. At some point, support accessed our server and configured it to be optimized for the hardware we had assigned to it. Does this need to be done with an azure VM, or can we just assign more resources to it in azure and carry on? What are the recommended processor and memory settings for anzure VM?","","Checked resources and re-optimized them.
