We were given a demo access of Netwrix Endpoint Protector.  The user is ""Emilio"", but it has already expired.
We have purchased the product to install on-premises and I would like to know if we can migrate the configuration we made in demo for the new implementation we are going to do.

Best regards","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-14T13:48:21.000Z"

We connected remote to the client's end and Adrian assisted with the proper migation to their new server on-prem.
Also, we assisted by setting up their two CAP rules that they had and client wanted to know about how can they deploy the EPP solution to their groups.
Informed the client they can either deploy it through a 3rd party deployment tool or through group policy.
Advised we will keep the ticket opened and we will follow up with them next week in case anything happens.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-14T14:13:15.000Z"
