Hi,


The configuration for Rights Functionality Priority is not stored in the database.
It is maintained in a configuration file on the server. (/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml).

This section:


--- CODE ---
rights_functionality:
  rights: 3
  priority: 2

--- CODE ---

rights:  (1 = Use computer rights , 2 =  Use user rights , 3 = Use Both)
 priority: (1 = User rights, 2 = Computer rights)


Regards,
Augustina

Are there any other configuration files or any other settings on the server that are not controlled by the Database?

Sorry for all the questions, I am trying to cover all of the bases before responding to them.

Hi Zachary,

This is the only configuration file in which settings are saved that I found in the project and know of.
