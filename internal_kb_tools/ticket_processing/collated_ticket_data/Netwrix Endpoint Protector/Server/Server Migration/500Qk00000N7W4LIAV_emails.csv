We are unable to access the admin console on the new server for some reason. Our network team has applied the required firewall rules. However, we are still unable to access admin console on the new server.

Is it possible to schedule a remote assist session to investigate this issue further?

Thanks Zachary!

 

We are unable to access the admin console on the new server for some reason. Our network team has applied the required firewall rules. However, we are still unable to access admin console on the new server.

 

Is it possible to schedule a remote assist session to investigate this issue further?

Thanks Zachary!

 

We are unable to access the admin console on the new server for some reason. Our network team has applied the required firewall rules. However, we are still unable to access admin console on the new server.

 

Is it possible to schedule a remote assist session to investigate this issue further?

Thanks Zachary!

We are unable to access the admin console on the new server for some reason. Our network team has applied the required firewall rules. However, we are still unable to access admin console on the new server.

Is it possible to schedule a remote assist session to investigate this issue further?

Thank you,

Hi Zachary,
For some reason IP setting on client download page keeps changing to the old server IP.

Is there a way to save the settings on this always be the new server IP on the new server?

New server IP is 10.20.32.166
Old server IP is 10.10.32.166

That IP seems to be populated from the IP of the server that is filled in from the appliance network configuration screen on the VM itself. Can you make sure that is correct. Then, can you check to see if a custom domain is set in the System Configuration -> System Settings -> Client Update Mechanism section and if the incorrect IP is set in the Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> IP Configuration section.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hi Zachary,

For some reason IP setting on client download page keeps changing to the old server IP.

 

Is there a way to save the settings on this always be the new server IP on the new server?

 

New server IP is 10.20.32.166

Old server IP is 10.10.32.166

We are unable to access the admin console on the new server for some reason. Our network team has applied the required firewall rules. However, we are still unable to access admin console on the new server.

 

Is it possible to schedule a remote assist session to investigate this issue further?

Hi Zachary,

Looks like the settings on the appliance are configured correctly already.

[cid:image001.png@01DBB9A8.7F97A310]

Also checked below settings:
[cid:image002.png@01DBB9A8.7F97A310]

[cid:image003.png@01DBB9A8.7F97A310]

Note: Custom hostname is blank as well on the old appliance.

Hello Chaitanya,

That IP seems to be populated from the IP of the server that is filled in from the appliance network configuration screen on the VM itself. Can you make sure that is correct. Then, can you check to see if a custom domain is set in the System Configuration -> System Settings -> Client Update Mechanism section and if the incorrect IP is set in the Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> IP Configuration section.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
