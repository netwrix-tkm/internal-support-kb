Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan ,


A new Hosted machine creation request, with all details, should be made via SalesForce for DevOps to spring up a new instance on the Jakarta region, which will then have a different FQDN.

Afterwards the support team should handle the migration from their old instance to the new.
