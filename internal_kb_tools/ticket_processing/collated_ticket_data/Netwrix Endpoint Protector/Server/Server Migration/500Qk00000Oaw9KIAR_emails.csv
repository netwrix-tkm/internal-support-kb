Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow, or any day next week and we will take a look together.

The resources that are allocated from the VM/Azure also need to be configured in the backend part of the server. We can take a look to optimize them accordingly. Regarding the amount of resources, it really depends on how many computers you are running the EPP client, how many modules you have activated, and other things. I think it would be best if we take a look together and then we can make some recommendations regarding resources.

Best Regards,
