"500Qk00000N8LusIAF","00439450","Support Ticket","Reequest for Updated EPP Instance and Assistance with Agent Removal","Dear End Point Protector team,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Together with @Enrico Casini, I procured an EPP license some time ago. We successfully deployed the provided VM in our environment, which operates completely offline with restricted access.

 

I would like to request an updated version of the EPP instance. Would it be possible to receive a new VM up to date for deployment in our laboratory?

 

Additionally, we recently encountered a critical issue: the current VM we were running crashed a few days ago. I reinstalled it from scratch, but now I am unable to remove the agents from the machine, even when using an Administrator account. Furthermore, the EPP interface does not allow me to uninstall the agents, resulting in a complete loss of control over them.

 

We urgently require assistance to resolve this issue. Could you please provide guidance on how to proceed?

 

Looking forward to your support.

 

Best regards,

gabriele

We have mentioned that they can use the same IP of the EPP server, so that the endpoints can communicate with the new server.

A meeting has been scheduled to discuss in more detailed matter the issue.

In the meeting we have discussed the details regarding the possibility of creating a new VM and how can we assist you and if there is a possibility to update the existing server using the offline patches.
