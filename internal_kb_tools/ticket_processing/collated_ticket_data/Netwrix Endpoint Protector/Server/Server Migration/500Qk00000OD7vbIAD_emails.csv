I’m Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I’ve been assigned to your case. I want to clarify that our hosted solution is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), rather than Microsoft Azure.

From a technical perspective, the only difference is that the server is hosted by us, so you only need to have the agents installed on the machines. They also need to have internet connection in order to communicate with the server.

I am adding my colleague Julia to the thread, for other details from a commercial perspective.

Thank you.

Hi Matt,

From a commercial perspective, you are currently spending $62,058 annually. Migrating to Saas would bring that cost up to $77,573 annually.

Please let us know if you have any other questions from a technical or commercial perspective.

Thank you.

Hi Matt,

Absolutely. Our support team will assist you with the migration and copying your configurations over from your current on-prem VM to the AWS Saas hosted setup.

If we decide to go with your Saas option are you able to copy our current configuration from the on-prem VM to the AWS hosted management setup?

Hi Matt,

We do not have a technical whitepaper going over this. Port 443 just needs to be open and IP will vary based on what we assign you. Please let us know if you have any follow up questions.

Thank you.

Hi Julia,

I appreciate you supplying what the difference in cost would be. Do you have a technical whitepaper on IPs/ports required for agents to talk to the Saas platform that you could send my way please?

Hi Matt,

From a commercial perspective, you are currently spending $62,058 annually. Migrating to Saas would bring that cost up to $77,573 annually.

Please let us know if you have any other questions from a technical or commercial perspective.

Thank you.

Subject: Walk Through of Azure Hosted Solution [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0OD7vb:ref ]
Hello Matt,

I’m Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I’ve been assigned to your case. I want to clarify that our hosted solution is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), rather than Microsoft Azure.

From a technical perspective, the only difference is that the server is hosted by us, so you only need to have the agents installed on the machines. They also need to have internet connection in order to communicate with the server.

I am adding my colleague Julia to the thread, for other details from a commercial perspective.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
