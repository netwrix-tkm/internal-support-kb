I would like to export just the data nothing else, so i chose the system backup and selected Database Content, Application Sources.
System backup hangs at 99% and it goes no further.
Is there any other way of extracting just the data, and importing the data onto the new server?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-05T12:03:52.000Z"
