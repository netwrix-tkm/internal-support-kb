I would like to export just the data nothing else, so i chose the system backup and selected Database Content, Application Sources.
System backup hangs at 99% and it goes no further.
Is there any other way of extracting just the data, and importing the data onto the new server?","","","","Solved by helping the customer with the System backup V2 for the migration.","","Adrian Draghici","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Migration","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","Logiq Consulting","Phil Parkes","2024-12-05T12:03:51.000Z","2024-12-12T13:26:27.000Z"
