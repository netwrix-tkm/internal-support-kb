Hi,

I have taken RI for c5a.xlarge, and it has 4 cpu and 8 gb of RAM. Also the
existing issue is related to the partition size of storage not related to
CPU and RAM.

Thank you for reply.
This ticket, that you raised in 1st of August was regarding the matter below:

Currently I am using c5a.xlarge instance on AWS Cloud. and aws suggested that ""Compute Optimizer found that this instance's CPU, EBS throughput, network bandwidth and network PPS are over-provisioned."" May you suggest optimised instance type so that I can save cost without any issue?

To have a better overview of the ongoing issues and the one that are resolved, I will ask you to please raise a separate ticket for a different topic.
Can we then consider this ticket closed now?

This is the only ticket that you currently still have open in our portal.
As mentioned, this ticket was created in August and is related to the question that you had regarding the suggestion of a optimized instance type.

Hello,

Thank you for reply.
This ticket, that you raised in 1st of August was regarding the matter below:

Currently I am using c5a.xlarge instance on AWS Cloud. and aws suggested that ""Compute Optimizer found that this instance's CPU, EBS throughput, network bandwidth and network PPS are over-provisioned."" May you suggest optimised instance type so that I can save cost without any issue?

To have a better overview of the ongoing issues and the one that are resolved, I will ask you to please raise a separate ticket for a different topic.
Can we then consider this ticket closed now?

Hi,
 

I have taken RI for c5a.xlarge, and it has 4 cpu and 8 gb of RAM. Also the existing issue is related to the partition size of storage not related to CPU and RAM.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
In our latest email exchange I wrote the following:

Please try first with t3.medium (2CPUs and 4GB RAM) and if you see that the resources are not enough, you may change to t3.large(2 CPUs and 8GB RAM).

Please let us know if this answers your query or if you have further questions regarding this topic.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Just to clarify, did you change the size of the instance and it's still over-provisioned?
