Hi Ramon,

I hope you are well.

Please see below feedback from devops:
""I think the customer's question does not have relevance here, because the copying of the image takes place from Azure to Azure, that is, from our Azure storage account to their Azure storage account, not from any of our internal Romanian office IP addresses.""

Regards,
Cristi

As per customer request:

When you come from an azure tenant, you are still coming from one of the public IP addresses assigned to your tenant. We need that IP address. The access works just fine if you are coming from one of the IPs in the ACL on the storage account. We need to include yours in that ACL.
