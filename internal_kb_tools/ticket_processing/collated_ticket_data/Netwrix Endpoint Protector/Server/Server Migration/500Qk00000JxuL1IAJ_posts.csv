Our customer ACCL has the server hosted by us, and our Devops team informed us that we need to migrate the server from Ubuntu 14.04 to 18.04 and then to 22.04. 

Can you please assist the customer with the whole migration process?

Customer is located in Bolivia and if possible please provide assistance in Spanish. 


Thank you!
