I hope this email finds you well.

 

Together with @Enrico Casini, I procured an EPP license some time ago. We successfully deployed the provided VM in our environment, which operates completely offline with restricted access.

 

I would like to request an updated version of the EPP instance. Would it be possible to receive a new VM up to date for deployment in our laboratory?

 

Additionally, we recently encountered a critical issue: the current VM we were running crashed a few days ago. I reinstalled it from scratch, but now I am unable to remove the agents from the machine, even when using an Administrator account. Furthermore, the EPP interface does not allow me to uninstall the agents, resulting in a complete loss of control over them.

 

We urgently require assistance to resolve this issue. Could you please provide guidance on how to proceed?

 

Looking forward to your support.

 

Best regards,

gabriele
