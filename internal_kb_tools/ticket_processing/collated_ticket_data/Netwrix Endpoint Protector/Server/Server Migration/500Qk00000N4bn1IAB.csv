"500Qk00000N4bn1IAB","00439227","Support Ticket","migration of server to new platform","We are closing a datacenter and need to migrate to another. The vmware infrastructure we are using will not be available in the new datacenter. Does endpointprotector support Nutanix? Another option we have is to move it to Azure. Is there a specific template we need to use for Azure? Can this run on a Windows server? If we deploy a new server, is the config migration as simple as creating a backup and then restoring that backup on the new server? Can we restore a linux config backup on a windows server?","","4/10/2025
