Thank you for reaching out!!!

Our EPP server images can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints. 

If required we can schedule a remote session where we can assist you with all this steps. 

Looking forward for your response.

If you want to keep the settings that you made on the old machine, you can create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI under the System Maintenance. 

!!Note that the server version needs to be the same, for example if you are using a EPP server version 5.9.1.0 the new one should be the same, to be able to import the backup.

Dear Daniel,

We are currently using an older version of EPP, and I would like to ask how to transfer the existing configurations to a newer EPP version.

If this is not possible unless both instances are on the same version, could you please advise how I can update my EPP instance offline? Specifically, if I am upgrading from EPP 5.8.x to EPP 5.9.1.0, does that mean I need to manually reconfigure everything?

Additionally, can you confirm whether installing a new VM with EPP 5.9.1.0 using the same IP address as the old instance will allow me to maintain control over the agents previously installed with EPP 5.8?

Dear Daniel,

 

We are currently using an older version of EPP, and I would like to ask how to transfer the existing configurations to a newer EPP version.

 

If this is not possible unless both instances are on the same version, could you please advise how I can update my EPP instance offline? Specifically, if I am upgrading from EPP 5.8.x to EPP 5.9.1.0, does that mean I need to manually reconfigure everything?

 

Additionally, can you confirm whether installing a new VM with EPP 5.9.1.0 using the same IP address as the old instance will allow me to maintain control over the agents previously installed with EPP 5.8?

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,
 

Thank you for your prompt response.

If you want to keep the settings that you made on the old machine, you can create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI under the System Maintenance. 

!!Note that the server version needs to be the same, for example if you are using a EPP server version 5.9.1.0 the new one should be the same, to be able to import the backup. 

If the new machine doesn't have the same IP the existing endpoints will communicate with the old one. 

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Team,

 

Thank you for the link.

 

“The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints.” à Unfortunately, this does not work with the current instance. I will try to deploy an updated version and see if it can reach the agents. Is there a way to deploy the new VM while keeping the configuration I had on the old VM?

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

“The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints.” à Unfortunately, this does not work with the current instance. I will try to deploy an updated version and see if it can reach the agents. Is there a way to deploy the new VM while keeping the configuration I had on the old VM?

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,

Thank you for reaching out!!!

Our EPP server images can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints. 

If required we can schedule a remote session where we can assist you with all this steps. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Team,

Thanks to your support, I was able to successfully uninstall the remaining agents from the workstations. I will now proceed with installing a new VM for EPP, version 5.9.4.0.

This time, I managed to handle everything on my own. In the future, I may reach out to you for assistance in updating version 5.9.4.0 on this VM without needing to redeploy it.

Thank you again for your help.

Best regards,
Gabriele

Dear Daniel,



We are currently using an older version of EPP, and I would like to ask how to transfer the existing configurations to a newer EPP version.



If this is not possible unless both instances are on the same version, could you please advise how I can update my EPP instance offline? Specifically, if I am upgrading from EPP 5.8.x to EPP 5.9.1.0, does that mean I need to manually reconfigure everything?



Additionally, can you confirm whether installing a new VM with EPP 5.9.1.0 using the same IP address as the old instance will allow me to maintain control over the agents previously installed with EPP 5.8?



Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,


Thank you for your prompt response.

If you want to keep the settings that you made on the old machine, you can create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI under the System Maintenance.

!!Note that the server version needs to be the same, for example if you are using a EPP server version 5.9.1.0 the new one should be the same, to be able to import the backup.

If the new machine doesn't have the same IP the existing endpoints will communicate with the old one.

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Team,



Thanks to your support, I was able to successfully uninstall the remaining agents from the workstations. I will now proceed with installing a new VM for EPP, version 5.9.4.0.



This time, I managed to handle everything on my own. In the future, I may reach out to you for assistance in updating version 5.9.4.0 on this VM without needing to redeploy it.



Thank you again for your help.



Best regards,

Gabriele

Dear Daniel,



We are currently using an older version of EPP, and I would like to ask how to transfer the existing configurations to a newer EPP version.



If this is not possible unless both instances are on the same version, could you please advise how I can update my EPP instance offline? Specifically, if I am upgrading from EPP 5.8.x to EPP 5.9.1.0, does that mean I need to manually reconfigure everything?



Additionally, can you confirm whether installing a new VM with EPP 5.9.1.0 using the same IP address as the old instance will allow me to maintain control over the agents previously installed with EPP 5.8?

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,


Thank you for your prompt response.

If you want to keep the settings that you made on the old machine, you can create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI under the System Maintenance.

!!Note that the server version needs to be the same, for example if you are using a EPP server version 5.9.1.0 the new one should be the same, to be able to import the backup.

If the new machine doesn't have the same IP the existing endpoints will communicate with the old one.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Gabriele,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00439450
Ticket Subject: Reequest for Updated EPP Instance and Assistance with Agent Removal
Ticket Details: Dear End Point Protector team,



I hope this email finds you well.



Together with @Enrico Casini, I procured an EPP license some time ago. We successfully deployed the provided VM in our environment, which operates completely offline with restricted access.



I would like to request an updated version of the EPP instance. Would it be possible to receive a new VM up to date for deployment in our laboratory?



Additionally, we recently encountered a critical issue: the current VM we were running crashed a few days ago. I reinstalled it from scratch, but now I am unable to remove the agents from the machine, even when using an Administrator account. Furthermore, the EPP interface does not allow me to uninstall the agents, resulting in a complete loss of control over them.



We urgently require assistance to resolve this issue. Could you please provide guidance on how to proceed?



Looking forward to your support.



Best regards,

gabriele

Dear Team,

 

Thanks to your support, I was able to successfully uninstall the remaining agents from the workstations. I will now proceed with installing a new VM for EPP, version 5.9.4.0.

 

This time, I managed to handle everything on my own. In the future, I may reach out to you for assistance in updating version 5.9.4.0 on this VM without needing to redeploy it.

 

Thank you again for your help.

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,
 

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the details regarding the possibility of creating a new VM and how can we assist you and if there is a possibility to update the existing server using the offline patches.

Please check the EPP server version and let us know how you wish to proceed.

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Daniel,

 

We are currently using an older version of EPP, and I would like to ask how to transfer the existing configurations to a newer EPP version.

 

If this is not possible unless both instances are on the same version, could you please advise how I can update my EPP instance offline? Specifically, if I am upgrading from EPP 5.8.x to EPP 5.9.1.0, does that mean I need to manually reconfigure everything?

 

Additionally, can you confirm whether installing a new VM with EPP 5.9.1.0 using the same IP address as the old instance will allow me to maintain control over the agents previously installed with EPP 5.8?

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,
 

Thank you for your prompt response.

If you want to keep the settings that you made on the old machine, you can create a System Backup V2 from the EPP UI under the System Maintenance. 

!!Note that the server version needs to be the same, for example if you are using a EPP server version 5.9.1.0 the new one should be the same, to be able to import the backup. 

If the new machine doesn't have the same IP the existing endpoints will communicate with the old one. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Team,

 

Thank you for the link.

 

“The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints.” à Unfortunately, this does not work with the current instance. I will try to deploy an updated version and see if it can reach the agents. Is there a way to deploy the new VM while keeping the configuration I had on the old VM?

 

Best regards,

Gabriele

Hello Gabriele,

Thank you for reaching out!!!

Our EPP server images can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

The image can be deployed from scratch and if required you can use the same IP as the old one, so that all the existing endpoints can communicate with the new VM.

In this way you will be able to navigate on the UI and remove / uninstall the endpoints. 

If required we can schedule a remote session where we can assist you with all this steps. 

Looking forward for your response.
