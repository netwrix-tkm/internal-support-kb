@WaitingOnEngineer

Instance type: t2.medium (Can we take another type than this, like t3.medium or t3a.medium, etc)?
Instance type is recommended based on the number of endpoints. They can use t3.medium for sure, or similar.


EBS Type: gp2 (Can we take another type than this, like gp3 or even Cold HDD)?

They can switch to gp3, would not recommend cold hdd as it is many times slower.



Can we take a smaller size, because we do not use and we will never use all that?
If the answer is no, then can we have an AMI that requires a smaller Requirement please (Ex: 20G if the disk space used is 14G)?

No, our smallest image is 100GB (14gb is only os, where would all the logs be stored? )
