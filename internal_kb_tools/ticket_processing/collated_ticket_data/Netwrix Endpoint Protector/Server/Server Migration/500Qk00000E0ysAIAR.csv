"500Qk00000E0ysAIAR","00417037","Support Ticket","Backup v2 migration transferred license and server ID to test EPP server","Hello,

Customer name is PrivatBank.
They have 1 main server with ID NMQG4OAA for 5000 endpoints and 2 test server for 50 endpoints with ID BGPR153X.
We noticed that after Backup v2 migration from the main server to test server, the ID of and number of endpoints also were migrated.
And because of it, they cannot apply the license file for their test server now,
Could you please help with this situation?
I will attach screenshots under the ticket.","","","","We used a command and set the server id back to what it was, the license import worked after setting the correct server ID. This case can be closed now.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Migration","NONE","","4.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-08-05T11:59:50.000Z","2024-08-09T11:24:14.000Z"
