This is regarding previous ticket 00423244. Apologies for the delayed response, but the customer has been indecisive about this matter. I recently had a meeting with them, and they are considering opting for a brand-new server as they feel their current one might be bloated. They have asked about the hardware requirements for a server running vSphere BUILD 7.0.3.0.1900 to support 500 clients with DC, DLP, DISCOVERY, and ENCRYPTION enabled. They plan to store data for one year. While they are not using shadow copy, file tracing is active on 60% of their machines, and the remaining machines have most ports blocked.

Additionally, they have a few questions regarding the process:

•Would they be able to transfer their existing license to the new machine?
•How would the new server communicate with the existing clients?
•What are the necessary steps to set this up in the safest and most efficient way?
•Would you provide a virtual device for them to download and configure? Their current version is 5.9.0.0.
•Could you please outline the steps in detail for them?

Best regards,
