"500Qk00000NoVPxIAN","00441265","Support Ticket","Need Clarification regrd server upgrade","We have recently upgraded our Linux agent to SLED 15. We are now planning to upgrade the server to version 5.9.4. We would like to confirm whether the Linux agent also needs to be upgraded again as part of this process. Kindly clarify.","","Customer upgraded their EPP Server to version 5.9.4.0 and inquired about upgrading the EPP Client for Linux endpoint machine running SLED 15.","We recommend that the Endpoint Protector Client also be upgraded with the Endpoint Protector Server, as the clients are developed and released together under the EPP Server functional releases / versions.
However in this case as SLED version 15 is old we may not have the most recent EPP client, we asked the customer to let us know what the current EPP client version is that is installed on the SLED endpoint machines.

Waiting on customer's response with requested details.
