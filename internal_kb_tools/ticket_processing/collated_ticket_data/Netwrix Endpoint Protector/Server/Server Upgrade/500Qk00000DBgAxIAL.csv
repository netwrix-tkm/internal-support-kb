I request your support to validate the following new at the time of updating the Endpoint protector server, it keeps loading up to 62.5% “An error occured. Hash does not match” 

for this server was requested access to the following URLs 
<a href='https://www.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>www.endpointprotector.com</a>
<a href='https://endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>endpointprotector.com</a>
178.63.3.86

this server is not allowed to access the internet, I would like to know what browsing permissions would be needed or if it is an issue of server configuration, 

Thank you
