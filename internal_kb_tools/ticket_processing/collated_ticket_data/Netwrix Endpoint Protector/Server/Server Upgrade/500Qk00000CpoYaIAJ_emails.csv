Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The hotfix was applied successfully to the EPP server.  We are aware of the hotfix update that appears in the list of ""Available EPP Software Updates"" after it was already applied and it still appears in the list after a Server reboot.   This will be removed from the software update list with the release of Endpoint Protector v5.9.4.0.  For now, please ignore the hotfix listed in the software update list.


Kind regards
