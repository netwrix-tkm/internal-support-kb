I have successfully applied the 'Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 – Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)' but when checking again in the console it still wants to apply the patch.

I am not sure if the patch has been successful but it looks so when I view the applied patches.

Please can you confirm I need to do anything.

I did not know what server OS version to put down as it is CoSoSys hosted so i have put Ubuntu 18.04 LTS...

Kind regards,
