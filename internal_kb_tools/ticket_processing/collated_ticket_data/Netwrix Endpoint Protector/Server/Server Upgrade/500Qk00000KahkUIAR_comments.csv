Please schedule the upgrade between 14:00 -17:00  CET, as in the past our devs indentify that during this slot the traffic is low on servers for BMW.

Unfortunately you had cancelled the appointment for today.

Unfortunately, as requested by Anatoli yesterday, we have not yet received a summary of why yesterday's attempt to update the ‘SaaS infrastructure’ to the latest version failed.

I'm still wondering why the update went smoothly in the INT environment and why a new update file was made available to us unannounced yesterday. I would also have expected the backup to be prepared before yesterday's deadline.

In addition, after the failure, the server load and the number of connected clients were pointed out as possible causes.

Sorry, but we can't just switch off all our clients in a hurry for an infrastructure update.

Unfortunately, our expectations are completely at odds with each other here, and this is a ‘SaaS infrastructure’ where I can't explain a manual update process anyway.

Please provide clarification and a plan on how such incidents can be prevented in the future and when a functional update will be available to us.

Kind Regards / Yours sincerely 

Kilian","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-01-29T13:48:59.000Z","2025-01-29T13:48:59.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer

The Upgrade Meeting can take place at 9PM.

Backup, prior to the Upgrade Meeting - we just need approval from BMW, and 1 h prior to the Upgrade Meeting, engineers can prepare the backup. This action can take place at 8PM, Monday 10th, just please confirm if that's ok and we have BMW approval.

Details about testing:

A brief QA scenerio will look like:

	 - 	Applying the patches on the environment
	 - 	Generate logs while patch is applying (connect disconnect different devices), logs should not enter in system and EPP Client is disconnected, ERROR recorded in EPP client logs and also visible in EPP Client interface

	 - 	After 720 patch is applied - check DC logs (logs are entering the system), create a CAP policy and trigger the policy (logs are present in the system), check logs both DC and CAP, connect a new device, check device list to see that new device is registered, install EPP Client on a new machine (client is registered and communicating), change different device rights, Change machine users (check if rights are correctly applied for each user)


Normally, we try and replicate about 15k agents ( ping , reprovision, connect ) requests and logs per day we try and get to about 250 rps (requests/logs per second) 

Below you can see part of the results made by our automation team:
