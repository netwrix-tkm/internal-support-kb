The current EPP Server version is 5.9.3.0.
If you want to update the EPP Server to the latest version there will be multiple offline patches to apply in order to get the server up to date.
Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for later today or Monday in order to apply the offline patch.

If you only want to apply only the vulnerability fix using the offline patch, then we can have a short meeting today (15 min) in order to assist you with this.

If you want to update the EPP Server to the latest version there will be multiple offline patches to apply in order to get the server up to date.
Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for later today or Monday in order to apply the offline patch.

If you only want to apply only the vulnerability fix using the offline patch, then we can have a short meeting today (15 min) in order to assist you with this.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Kyle,

The current EPP Server version is 5.9.3.0.
If you want to update the EPP Server to the latest version there will be multiple offline patches to apply in order to get the server up to date.
Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for later today or Monday in order to apply the offline patch.

If you only want to apply only the vulnerability fix using the offline patch, then we can have a short meeting today (15 min) in order to assist you with this.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Kyle,

You can access Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader -> Apply the vulnerability patch again -> Wait until it shows the notification regarding the patch being applied (if it appears, then the patch is applied)

It will not cause any issues if the patch is applied for the second time.

Best regards,
Emil

Apologies I am running Version 5.9.3.0.

Is there any way to make sure the vulnerability patch was applied properly?

This is an Air gapped system so we won’t be able to remote to the system.

Apologies I am running Version 5.9.3.0.

[cid:image002.png@01DACC55.0B9AC5F0]


Is there any way to make sure the vulnerability patch was applied properly?

This is an Air gapped system so we won’t be able to remote to the system.

I applied all the supplied patches and am now version 5.9.0.0.

Are there any more patches available?

Hello Kyle,

You do not have the ""View Applied Patches"" button because you have to fill in all the details requested in Dashboard -> Live update and then to successfully send the request in order to register the EPP Server.
Only after the server registration you will be able to see the ""View Applied Patches"" button.

Hello Kyle,

It will not cause any issues if the patch is applied for the second time.

Hello Kyle, You do not have the ""View Applied Patches"" button because you have to fill in all the details requested in Dashboard -> Live update and then to successfully send the request in order to register the EPP Server. Only

Hello Kyle,

You do not have the ""View Applied Patches"" button because you have to fill in all the details requested in Dashboard -> Live update and then to successfully send the request in order to register the EPP Server.
Only after the server registration you will be able to see the ""View Applied Patches"" button.

Best regards,

Looks like it applied successfully.

Do we need to put in a Ticket for why I don’t have that option to see the patches

Hello Kyle, You can access Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader -> Apply the vulnerability patch again -> Wait until it shows the notification regarding the patch being applied (if it appears, then the patch is applied)

It will not cause any issues if the patch is applied for the second time.

Apologies I am running Version 5.9.3.0.

[cid:image002.png@01DACC5F.B277B540]


Is there any way to make sure the vulnerability patch was applied properly?

This is an Air gapped system so we won’t be able to remote to the system.

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for later today or Monday in order to apply the offline patch.

If you only want to apply only the vulnerability fix using the offline patch, then we can have a short meeting today (15 min) in order to assist you with this.
