- Chose the downloaded file
- Click on the Upload Patch button (click on it only once, then wait)

Sounds good – if you can provide an offline patch – I can give that a try. Though, I don’t think it worked last time.

 

Version 5.9.4.0 – I think that is the latest update?

Looks like once I did log off on, the version is showing updated even though I got a failure message as per my previous email screenshot. Can you confirm if this is correct client version?
