- You have to download it and NOT extracting the files
- Go to Dashboard -> Live Updates and click on Offline Patch Uploader
- Chose the downloaded file
- Click on the Upload Patch button (click on it only once, then wait)
- After the confirmation message is displayed you can click on the Back button and see if the update starts

Please let me know if that will work.

Sounds good â€“ if you can provide an offline patch â€“ I can give that a try. Though, I donâ€™t think it worked last time.

 

Version 5.9.4.0 â€“ I think that is the latest update?

Looks like once I did log off on, the version is showing updated even though I got a failure message as per my previous email screenshot. Can you confirm if this is correct client version?
