Server Updates Not Being Applied

This is on hold for some reason, and I cannot see anything other than my side of the conversation regarding it.  I also cannot comment on it.   Clicking ""Provide Feedback"" takes me to a broken link.   I have no choice but to open a new ticket, 

   The server has multiple critical vulnerabilities related to openssl the earliest of which has been open since January.  I would like to know when these will be addressed and to make sure that the ticket is still active as I do not know what ""on hold"" means nor do I see comments.","","Issue: On Hold tab on the customer Salesforce UI is not displaying the tickets.Raised the issue with Cristian.
