Hi,



What I noticed from the attached log is that the last three patches were added as offline patches. The previous online patch applied with success was on 2024.02.01.

After this date, all the update patches logs return the same error message 'Update Archive checksum does not match the received checksum from Live Update Server'.

1. You can try to apply the offline patch for 5941.


2. The customer needs to check why the live update download doesn't work.

telnet liveupdate.endpointprotector.com was connecting but then immediately closing. 

Can you please check if the firewall is blocking HTTP traffic? Verify if outbound/inbound rules are blocking port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). It is possible that after port 80 was whitelisted, the online patch started downloading.

I understand that the firewall is not blocking HTTP traffic.
Can the customer apply the offline patch? Did you try?

The offline for 5941 is not out yet, and the customer would like to use the live update function.
Is there anything else that we might check to see why it fails?

Hi,



You can tell them to check that proxy options are not enabled if they do not have /or to activate and set proxy if they use internally for HTTPS / HTTP.

Check also the System Configuration -> Proxy Server Settings.

Can you please check the download archive for the patch? Location path:

--- CODE ---
 ls -la /var/eppfiles/backup/patches/HWA-EPP4-U006X/
--- CODE ---

 X - replace X with the patch number

Check the size of the archive EPPServer_HWA-EPP4-U006X_XXXXXX.tar.gz

Share also a screen with the content of 

--- CODE ---
/var/eppfiles/backup/patches/HWA-EPP4-U006X/
--- CODE ---

Calculate hash for archive

--- CODE ---md5sum /var/eppfiles/backup/patches/HWA-EPP4-U006X/EPPServer_HWA-EPP4-U006X_XXXXXX.tar.gz 
--- CODE ---
