Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

The appliance that you are using is 5 years old version and due to this, most probably your the appliance is on a Ubuntu 14.

Updating such an old version of EPP server, would not be possible unless the support has direct access to the backend of the server, as there will be need it to be applied 20+ patches which require close attention (due to airgaped appliance that the user has, we will not be able to supervise the patch by patch upgrade) .

Beside this, due to the old version of Ubuntu and mysql, patch version 5.6.5.0 will not be applied as it requires at least Ubuntu 18 version.

Having into consideration all the details listed above and after discussing internally, we decided to recommend you a fresh install of the EPP server, which will also involve a new set of EPP clients.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Daniel,

Thanks for the reply.
Do you think that there is a way to export the configuration from the existing EPP server to the new one ?
