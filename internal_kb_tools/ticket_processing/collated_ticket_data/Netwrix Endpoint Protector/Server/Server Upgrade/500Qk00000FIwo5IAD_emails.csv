Hi Helin,

Thank you for your email.
Based on your screenshot, this indicates that the process is still ongoing, and not finished yet,
as there is no error message displayed.
This backing up of database process can take in some rare cases even hours, if the Database is very large.
You can check the exact size, as per below screenshot.
For the time being, I suggest to leave the update running, until it is completed, or an error message is displayed.

Hi Helin,

Thank you for your email.
Based on your screenshot, this indicates that the process is still ongoing, and not finished yet,
as there is no error message displayed.
This backing up of database process can take in some rare cases even hours, if the Database is very large.
You can check the exact size, as per below screenshot.
For the time being, I suggest to leave the update running, until it is completed, or an error message is displayed.

Hi Helin,

Thank you for your email.
Based on your screenshot, this indicates that the process is still ongoing, and not finished yet,
as there is no error message displayed.
This backing up of database process can take in some rare cases even hours, if the Database is very large.
You can check the exact size, as per below screenshot.
For the time being, I suggest to leave the update running, until it is completed, or an error message is displayed.

Hi Helin,

Thank you for your email.
Based on your screenshot, this indicates that the process is still ongoing, and not finished yet,
as there is no error message displayed.
This backing up of database process can take in some rare cases even hours, if the Database is very large.
You can check the exact size, as per below screenshot.
For the time being, I suggest to leave the update running, until it is completed, or an error message is displayed.

Hi Helin,

Thank you for your email.
Based on your screenshot, this indicates that the process is still ongoing, and not finished yet,
as there is no error message displayed.
This backing up of database process can take in some rare cases even hours, if the Database is very large.
You can check the exact size, as per below screenshot.
For the time being, I suggest to leave the update running, until it is completed, or an error message is displayed.
