we are currently on 5.9.4.1 and the backend updates are not installing.
When we click on Apply Backend Updates the Normal text shows, that this may take a few minutes, but the updates were never installed.
We have tried this a few times.
Is there a log in wich we can see the messages?
Kind Regards,
Felix Dahms","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-21T12:27:15.000Z"
