Good Day!

We have received 2 cases from R&T customer: 

1. They upgrading the server from 5930 to 5940, but the upgrade process is stuck with an error. Screenshot of the error is attached with the ticket. 

2. They are not able to generate responses via Edge built in copilot tool. Although there is no log in EPP for this blocking. Please find the screenshot for this issue too.

Please assist on this.

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-07T06:52:03.000Z"
