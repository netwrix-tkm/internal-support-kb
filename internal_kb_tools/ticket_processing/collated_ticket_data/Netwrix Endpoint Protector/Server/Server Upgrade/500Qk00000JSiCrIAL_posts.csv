I have upgraded version of our EndPoint protector from a really old operating system and now I receive an error message that it is running out of space: 

Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 6.36 gb free available from 19.52 gb (33%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.

Can you please help me. 

Also the version of the Operating system is really old.  What is the possible way to upgrade it. Our EndPoint Protector is hosted 

Thanks in advance, 
Sonya Yoncheva","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-13T11:33:33.000Z"
