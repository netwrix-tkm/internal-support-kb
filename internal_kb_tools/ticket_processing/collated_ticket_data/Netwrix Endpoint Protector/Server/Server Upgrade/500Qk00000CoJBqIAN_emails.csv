Please let me know if you have availability for a quick remote session today.

If the patch was applied once or more times it is okay. The reason why the patch persists is because this compared to other patches is not a versioned patch/upgrade(it can be applied on different EPP server versions).

If you applied it once or several times, please leave it as it is and ignore the fact that it is still available to be applied. This will go away on the next EPP server release/upgrade.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Server Hotfix patch was applied and the logs were present on the EPP server.

Regarding the EPP clients, I will leave below the download links for the versions containing the vulnerability fix on the client side. They can be deployed using an MDM tool or SCCM.

Clients:
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

We are closing this ticket.
