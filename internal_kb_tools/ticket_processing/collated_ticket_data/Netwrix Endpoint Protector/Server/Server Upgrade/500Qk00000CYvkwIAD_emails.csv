Thank you for contacting our support department.

Can you please check under the Live Update menu for the View applied updates button and let us know if the hotfix is present in there ?

If it is, then the patch has been successfully applied and the request to update it again will disappear after the EPP server update to 5.9.4.0
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the 5.9.4.0 version will be released.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
