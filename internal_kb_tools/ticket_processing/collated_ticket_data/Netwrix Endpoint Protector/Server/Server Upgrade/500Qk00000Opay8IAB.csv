I am writing to inquire about the current support status for the Netwrix Endpoint Protector hardware appliance. Could you please confirm if this hardware is still supported, if applicable, provide the end of support date?

As per the recent update version of Netwrix Endpoint Protector server 5.9.4.2 published on the community page, it noted that the compatibility is validated for Netwrix Ubuntu 18.0.4 and 22.04 based images (<a href='https://community.netwrix.com/t/5-9-4-2-cumulative-upgrade-patch-for-endpoint-protector-server-5-7-0-0-5-9-4-1/9321' target='_blank'>https://community.netwrix.com/t/5-9-4-2-cumulative-upgrade-patch-for-endpoint-protector-server-5-7-0-0-5-9-4-1/9321</a>). However, our customer is currently utilizing the Netwrix Endpoint Protector (v.5.9.4.1) Hardware Appliance with Ubuntu 14.04. . We are considering an upgrade to the new version 5.9.4.2, and would like to understand any potential risks associated with this upgrade.

In light of above, if the hardware appliance is no longer supported, I would appreciate your recommendations for alternative solutions or upgrades that align with the features and functionality of the Endpoint Protector.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your prompt response.
