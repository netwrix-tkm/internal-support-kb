With the recent security advisory from Netwrix for EPP, from the link below:
<a href='https://security.netwrix.com/advisories/adv-2025-001?mkt_tok=MTMwLU1BTi0wODkAAAGYKCRvPoM4C6Z6bzomJK7soXy0Otmv1H3tRX1P11Z4TqeGeCv31XLgKsBCoYyBHUid5E-I4eGUMSyMTWWPk9k9HczgdZVtBLNYVz9zKLVQsO3KmqfG#' target='_blank'>https://security.netwrix.com/advisories/adv-2025-001?mkt_tok=MTMwLU1BTi0wODkAAAGYKCRvPoM4C6Z6bzomJK7soXy0Otmv1H3tRX1P11Z4TqeGeCv31XLgKsBCoYyBHUid5E-I4eGUMSyMTWWPk9k9HczgdZVtBLNYVz9zKLVQsO3KmqfG#</a>

We understand the solution for this advisory is to upgrade the firmware of the Server to 5.9.4.1.

However, we have some users that are in an offline airgapped environment. As such, they will need the offline patch for 5.9.4.1.
We understand there is no estimate date for the offline patch for 5.9.4.1; but we still need to know a rough timeline of the availability of this offline patch.

Seek your assistance to advise on the timeline of this offline update,

Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-22T04:45:15.000Z"
