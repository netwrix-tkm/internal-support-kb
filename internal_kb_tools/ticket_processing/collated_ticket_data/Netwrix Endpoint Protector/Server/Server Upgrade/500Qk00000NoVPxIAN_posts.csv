However in this case as SLED version 15 is old we may not have the most recent EPP client, we asked the customer to let us know what the current EPP client version is that is installed on the SLED endpoint machines.

Waiting on customer's response with requested details.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-09T17:53:52.000Z"
