While trying to upgrade the server with the provided offline patch update, its showing error in the live update page as ""Can not apply patch, wrong version"". It has not been resolved still. Also noticed that the policy appliying to endpoints also not mapping and saved in the server. It's unsafe for us to protect the data. Kindly take as high priority and provide fix. 

Thanks,
M. Sivakumar.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-13T07:25:51.000Z"

Is having an issue whereby their Live update page times out when we click on ""Check Now"". When the page does return then it also does not show the update patch for 5.9.4.1.

We checked the Inodes and removed all the file shadows. We have also applied all the backend security updates.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-28T08:51:44.000Z"
