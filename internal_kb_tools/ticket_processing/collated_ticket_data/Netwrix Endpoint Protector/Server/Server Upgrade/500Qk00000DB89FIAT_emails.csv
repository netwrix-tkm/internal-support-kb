Thank you for your reply.
Could you please tell me your availability for Friday or next week so that we can arrange a remote session via Zoom to resolve this matter? 
For the remote session you will need to have Putty installed on your computer as I would need to access the server via SSH.
 
Have a nice day,

Hello Alin,

Unfortunately this is not possible as it is an air-gapped network and I
could only allow special internet access for the live update.
Please tell me how I can do it offline.
I have Linux experience so it is not a problem to do something via the CLI
of the EPP appliance VM,

Best Regards,
Volker
