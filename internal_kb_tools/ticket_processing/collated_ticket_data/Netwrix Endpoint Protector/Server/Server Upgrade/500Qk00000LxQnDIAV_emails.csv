Thank you for allowing us to assist you in today's remote session.

To recap what we did during the remote session:

1.We created a copy of the backup from the old server through the backend.
2.We imported it on the new server successfully.
3. We checked the users/computers/ server maintenance and everything looks in place.

We have asked Daniel to monitor the new server and let us know in case anything comes up so that we can assist further with the problem.

Looking forward to your response.
