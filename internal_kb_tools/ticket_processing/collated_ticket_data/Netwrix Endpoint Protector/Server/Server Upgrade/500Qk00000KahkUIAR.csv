Anatoli Lorenz","","BMW is seeking a meeting on 10th of Feb (after 9PM or 13AM DE Time) for the Prod Environment
They are also asking for Information about our testing, like how many logs are made and on how many clients we are testing. They would love when we clone their Prod Environment and test it. (I am not sure if this is possible)
We should prepare a Backup before the meeting is taking place. ""","Upgrade production environment on 10Feb per customer request.","We encountered some challenges as the patch 7.1.9 failed in the UI but was successfully applied in the backend. For 7.2.0 there were some manual actions that needed to be taken in order for it to be successfully applied.
As the new patch was in place, the log ingestion side was modified, and as such the load on the servers resources increased and had to be optimized for it not to crash.
The large implementation time can be also considered due to the high number of devices that needed to be updated, and the need of us to monitor this operation (that the old/ new logs are truly received by the server).","Backend Server Fix","Alin Anca","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","35.0","Closed - Resolved","BMW Group AG","Anatoli Lorenz","2025-01-14T13:11:04.000Z","2025-02-18T13:57:15.000Z"
