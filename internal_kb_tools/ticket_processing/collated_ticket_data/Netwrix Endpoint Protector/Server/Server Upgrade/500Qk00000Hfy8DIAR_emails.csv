Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:

Provided the image for the 5940 latest EPP server:

	
	
		https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_images_5940/Endpoint-Protector-5.9.4.0-Virtual-Appliance-MNL257.zip 
		https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_images_5940/Endpoint-Protector-5.9.4.0-Virtual-Appliance-MNL257.md5 
	
	

Important: When migrating please always make sure that the 2 EPP server versions are on the same version(5940)

Steps:
1. Please create a Snapshot of the old EPP server.
2. Please install the above mentioned image on your VM and assign it a new IP.
3. Please make sure that the OLD EPP server is upgraded to 5940, if not upgrade it to that version.
4. From the OLD EPP server version please create a System Backup v2 - please save the key as it will be used when uploading it to the NEW EPP server version.
5. After the System Backup v2 is complete, please download it.
6. You may now at any point assign a new IP to the OLD EPP server.
7. On the NEW EPP server - import the System Backup v2 that you downloaded at step 5.
8. If it does not upload and it says the file is too large, please let us know and we will connect - we will need to SSH into the backend of the NEW EPP server to adjust the size of the upload.
9. After the Upload of the System Backup v2 is complete, please refresh the browser and log back in with the credentials from the OLD EPP server - they should work now.
10. Please check to make sure that the OLD and NEW EPP servers are a 1-to-1 match(Computers, Policies, Settings, Licenses, etc.)
11. You can now allocate the IP of the OLD EPP server to the NEW EPP server and the endpoints should connect and communicate with the new EPP server now.

We will leave this ticket open in case you encounter any issues.

Hello,
For the first network, we are running on VMware ESXI and have the EPP server version: 5.9.3.0. 

 

Also, we are looking to migrate our old servers to these new servers. These will not be additional servers in our lineup.

 

Thank you!

Danny

Hi Daniel,

Can you please let us know what you are referring to when you mentioned ""new server hardware""?

We currently have the following platforms for the EPP server:
- VM on the customers side
- cloud hosted on Netwrix side(AWS)
- cloud hosted on customers side(AWS, Azure, GCP)

Also can you please provide us with more details for what the new EPP server is needed? Is it for a migration from older EPP servers or for a new server?
