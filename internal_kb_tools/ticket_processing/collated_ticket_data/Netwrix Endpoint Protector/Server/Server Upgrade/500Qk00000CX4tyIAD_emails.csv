Do you remember by any chance if the customer has partitioning enabled? Or if they can send us a screenshot of the Logs section so we can see from there?

We can also schedule a remote session with them and apply the upgrades together through Offline Patches.

Please find below the Offline Patches.

Before starting the upgrade process we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP Server from the VM. Please also create a Snapshot after applying the 5.8.1.0 Offline patch just as a precaution.

To upgrade the EPP server to the 5.7.0.0, 5.7.1.0, 5.8.0.0 ... 5.9.3.0 versions, you will have to access Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline patch uploader.
 
Please select Choose File -> Select the patch file 5.7.0.0 -> Upload Patch. Please wait a few moments after pressing Upload Patch and you should receive a green message on the top of the page that the upload was successful. You can track the progress of the installation in Dashboard -> Live Update(it takes about 5 - 10 minutes per patch).

Please repeat the steps for each EPP server version upgrade and in order: 5.6.0.0 -> 5.7.0.0 -> 5.7.1.0 -> 5.8.0.0 -> 5.8.1.0 -> 5.9.0.0 -> 5.9.1.0 -> 5.9.2.0 -> 5.9.3.0.

Hello team,

We discovered that emgepron had a problem with disk size before making the
upgrade and the audit logs are not solving, can we schedule a time
between 9-11 BRT or 14-17 BRT? So we can clean it up and so on.

Hello team,
 

We discovered that emgepron had a problem with disk size before making the upgrade and the audit logs are not solving, can we schedule a time between 9-11 BRT or 14-17 BRT? So we can clean it up and so on.

 

Best regards,

Hi Lucas,

Please also apply the latest Vulnerability patch for the customer as well, or let me know when you would like us to have a remote session so we can apply it together.

This Offline Patch should be applied over the 5.9.3.0 EPP server version.

Hi Lucas,

Please find below the Offline Patches.

Before starting the upgrade process we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP Server from the VM. Please also create a Snapshot after applying the 5.8.1.0 Offline patch just as a precaution.

To upgrade the EPP server to the 5.7.0.0, 5.7.1.0, 5.8.0.0 ... 5.9.3.0 versions, you will have to access Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline patch uploader.
 
Please select Choose File -> Select the patch file 5.7.0.0 -> Upload Patch. Please wait a few moments after pressing Upload Patch and you should receive a green message on the top of the page that the upload was successful. You can track the progress of the installation in Dashboard -> Live Update(it takes about 5 - 10 minutes per patch).

Please repeat the steps for each EPP server version upgrade and in order: 5.6.0.0 -> 5.7.0.0 -> 5.7.1.0 -> 5.8.0.0 -> 5.8.1.0 -> 5.9.0.0 -> 5.9.1.0 -> 5.9.2.0 -> 5.9.3.0.

Do you remember by any chance if the customer has partitioning enabled? Or if they can send us a screenshot of the Logs section so we can see from there?

We can also schedule a remote session with them and apply the upgrades together through Offline Patches.

Hello team,
 

We discovered that emgepron had a problem with disk size before making the upgrade and the audit logs are not solving, can we schedule a time between 9-11 BRT or 14-17 BRT? So we can clean it up and so on.

 

Best regards,

Hi Lucas,

Please also apply the latest Vulnerability patch for the customer as well, or let me know when you would like us to have a remote session so we can apply it together.

This Offline Patch should be applied over the 5.9.3.0 EPP server version.

Hi Lucas,

Please find below the Offline Patches.

Before starting the upgrade process we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP Server from the VM. Please also create a Snapshot after applying the 5.8.1.0 Offline patch just as a precaution.

To upgrade the EPP server to the 5.7.0.0, 5.7.1.0, 5.8.0.0 ... 5.9.3.0 versions, you will have to access Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline patch uploader.
 
Please select Choose File -> Select the patch file 5.7.0.0 -> Upload Patch. Please wait a few moments after pressing Upload Patch and you should receive a green message on the top of the page that the upload was successful. You can track the progress of the installation in Dashboard -> Live Update(it takes about 5 - 10 minutes per patch).

Please repeat the steps for each EPP server version upgrade and in order: 5.6.0.0 -> 5.7.0.0 -> 5.7.1.0 -> 5.8.0.0 -> 5.8.1.0 -> 5.9.0.0 -> 5.9.1.0 -> 5.9.2.0 -> 5.9.3.0.

Hi Lucas,

Do you remember by any chance if the customer has partitioning enabled? Or if they can send us a screenshot of the Logs section so we can see from there?

We can also schedule a remote session with them and apply the upgrades together through Offline Patches.
