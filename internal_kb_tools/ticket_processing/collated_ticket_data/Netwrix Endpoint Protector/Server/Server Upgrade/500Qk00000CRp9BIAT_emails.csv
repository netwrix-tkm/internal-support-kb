Please find below the Server Offline Patches.

Before upgrading the EPP server we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP server from the VM/AWS/Azure/GCP, where the server is hosted.

Please go to Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline patch uploader.
 
Please select Choose File -> Select the patch file 5.9.0.0 -> Upload Patch. Please wait a few moments after pressing Upload Patch and you should receive a green message on the top of the page that the upload was successful. You can track the progress of the installation in Dashboard -> Live Update(it takes about 5 - 10 minutes per patch).

Please repeat the steps for each EPP server version upgrade and in order: 5.9.0.0 -> 5.9.1.0 -> 5.9.2.0 -> 5.9.3.0. -> Vulnerability Patch.
