Sorry for the inconvenience, we have recently transitioned to a new ticketing platform.
Your ticket remains active, and internally we are currently awaiting a new image release that aims to address the identified vulnerabilities. As mentioned during our last remote session on this topic, we do not have an exact timeline for the new image, but we anticipate it will be available in Q3.
The reason you are currently seeing the status of your ticket as 'on hold' is due to this pending release. 

I have just sent the above update on the 00409840 as well. Just to confirm that the original ticket is still active, could you please check whether you are able to view the new update on the other ticket?

Thank you for your understanding,

Hi Veronica,

Sorry for the inconvenience, we have recently transitioned to a new ticketing platform.
Your ticket remains active, and internally we are currently awaiting a new image release that aims to address the identified vulnerabilities. As mentioned during our last remote session on this topic, we do not have an exact timeline for the new image, but we anticipate it will be available in Q3.
The reason you are currently seeing the status of your ticket as 'on hold' is due to this pending release. 

I have just sent the above update on the 00409840 as well. Just to confirm that the original ticket is still active, could you please check whether you are able to view the new update on the other ticket?

Thank you for your understanding,

Hi Veronica,

Sorry for the inconvenience, we have recently transitioned to a new ticketing platform.
Your ticket remains active, and internally we are currently awaiting a new image release that aims to address the identified vulnerabilities. As mentioned during our last remote session on this topic, we do not have an exact timeline for the new image, but we anticipate it will be available in Q3.
The reason you are currently seeing the status of your ticket as 'on hold' is due to this pending release.

I have just sent the above update on the 00409840 as well. Just to confirm that the original ticket is still active, could you please check whether you are able to view the new update on the other ticket?

Thank you for your understanding,
