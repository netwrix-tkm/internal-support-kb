Thank you for reaching out!

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events.
Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue.
As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.

The client version will be provided as soon as the patch will be live again.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
