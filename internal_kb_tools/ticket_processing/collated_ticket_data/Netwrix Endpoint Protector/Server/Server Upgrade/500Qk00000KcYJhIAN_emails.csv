Eduard,

Alas, we need an assist or support call.  No matter how we set up the VM/network the web server is not starting.  We can ping both VMs (native import and manual VM creation w/attached VHD) regardless of static or DHCP IP and MAC addresses match the VMs in the ARP table but no web interface comes up for either one.  We receive the error in the screenshot below on both VMs on a fresh reboot.","Netwrix Support Ticket #432135 - EPP VM running on 14.04 LTS query (EoS April 2024)","sgc@warwickinvestmentgroup.com","Stephen Craig","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-10T18:52:07.000Z","true"

Before we do that, can you please make sure the VM has exactly two network adapters, both should be bridged.
This error appears when nginx cannot start and in all my previous cases there was a missing NIC.
Let me know if that solves the issue.

Thank you,
