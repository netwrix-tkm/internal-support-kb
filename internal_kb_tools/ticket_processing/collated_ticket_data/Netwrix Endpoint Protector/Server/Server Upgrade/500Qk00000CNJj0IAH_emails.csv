Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

 

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

 

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

 

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Alin,

I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.

Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?

As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).

Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.

@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.

Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Manpreet,

I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.

Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.

As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.

So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.

Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.

As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...

While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara,

Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.

Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.

Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.
Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

External E-Mail
Manpreet,

I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.

Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.

As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.

So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.

Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.

As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...

While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.

Hi Sara,



Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.



Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.



Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.

I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,



Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.



Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.



Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



Kind Regards,

Hi Sara,

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.
Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.
So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.

I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,



Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.



Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.



Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara,

 

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.

Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.

So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

 

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.



 



I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,

 

Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.

 

Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.

 

Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



 



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday. 



 



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



 



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue. 



 



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



 



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



 



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



 



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



 



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,

 

I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.

 

Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?

 

As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).

 

Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.

 

@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.

 

Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for  hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

 

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

 

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

 

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara,

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.
Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.
So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.

I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,



Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.



Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.



Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara,

 

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.

Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.

So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

 

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.



 



I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,

 

Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.

 

Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.

 

Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



 



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday. 



 



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



 



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue. 



 



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



 



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



 



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



 



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



 



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,

 

I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.

 

Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?

 

As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).

 

Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.

 

@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.

 

Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for  hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

 

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

 

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

 

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Dear Manpreet,

I will help you with the entire operation:
1) just before our session - the DevOps team will create a snapshot so we have a double safety measure;
2) we will apply the offline patch during our meeting - which you can download in advance from the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz
3) we will check the entire UI so that we make sure everything works ok.

Hi Sara,

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.
Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.
So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.

I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,



Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.



Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.



Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday.



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue.



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



Kind Regards,



Sara Hall | Associate Director, Customer Success

Hi Alin,



I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.



Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?



As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).



Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.



@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.



Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,



As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.



I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.



We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?



Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Sara,

 

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.

Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.

So just want to be on the safer side with Support team’s availability.

 

Please let us know how it goes. We are waiting for an update from your side.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.



 



I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,

 

Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.

 

Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.

 

Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



 



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday. 



 



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



 



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue. 



 



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



 



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



 



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



 



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



 



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,

 

I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.

 

Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?

 

As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).

 

Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.

 

@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.

 

Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for  hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

 

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

 

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

 

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Dear Manpreet,

I will help you with the entire operation:
1) just before our session - the DevOps team will create a snapshot so we have a double safety measure;
2) we will apply the offline patch during our meeting - which you can download in advance from the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz
3) we will check the entire UI so that we make sure everything works ok.

Hi Sara,

 

The reason I wanted a meting with support right after the Hotfix patching is to deal with any eventuality.

Last time we upgraded the server to version 5.9.3.0 , Offline temporary password page broke and it was not getting loaded.  It took almost 4-5 hours for Adrian and development team to fix it.

Hey Manpreet- I didn't know meeting with Support right after was a requirement. I haven't heard back if someone will be available for a RS today, so I asked our devops team to wait on applying the patch until we have a RS scheduled.



 



I am working to see if we are still able to get it done today, if not, we will need to schedule it for Monday.

Hi Sara,

 

Yes you can check if they can push the hotfix on production server. Yes we are okay with Hotfix patching on our Server.

 

Please let us know the schedule, I have raised Emergency change and are waiting for the approval.

 

Also would like to know if someone would be available from EPP Support to help us validate that everything is working fine on the Server.

Adrian helped me validate and resolve issues in Last Server upgrade. If you’ll are not working on Saturday’s & Sunday’s then schedule for Monday India times. (Anytime post 10 AM IST).

Manpreet,



 



I can help shed some light on the delays since last Thursday. 



 



Some customers were patched beginning on Friday of last week, and soon after that, Netwrix started receiving reports that some systems ceased to process certain logged events. Netwrix confirmed the behavior and began working on a fix. As a precaution, Netwrix temporarily paused the distribution of the hotfix (on the 2nd of July) until a replacement was available.



 



As of this morning, A revised hotfix for CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix versions 5.6.0.0 through 5.9.3.0, labeled Hotfix 1.1, was released. This hotfix addresses and supersedes the prior hotfix and resolves the event processing issue. 



 



So with that said, we didn't have an acceptable hotfix to be pushed to your environment until today.



 



Can you please confirm that is it OK for our team to push the hotfix to the production server ASAP? They are currently working on pushing the hotfix to the staging server, but I would like to be 100% sure that it is okay for them to push to the production server. If it is OK, I will send in the request and update you as soon as it is pushed.



 



As for your second question, regarding the currently deployed agents...



 



While the server hotfix is the most critical to apply, we advise customers to act with urgency in updating their agents, while following an expedited testing and emergency change control process. CVE-2024-36073, CVE-2024-36074, and CVE-2024-36075 affect the agents, and may permit an attacker to escalate privileges on an affected endpoint or bypass DLP policies. While the scope of impact is limited to each endpoint, an attacker may be able to utilize them as part of a chain to cause greater damage.



 



Kind Regards,

Hi Alin,

 

I regret having to emphasize this, but we have been awaiting a response for the past week regarding the Remote Code Vulnerability patch. In the last three emails, including your most recent communication, you mentioned to check in each one but not sure what is taking so long if it is to be checked with internal teams.

 

Is patching the Remote Code Vulnerability such a trivial matter for CoSoSys (Netwrix) that it does not want to provide a schedule, let alone apply the patch to the server?

 

As per the advisory, Servers hosted at CoSoSys end will be patched starting 28th June 2024. Has it started or our number comes at the very end ? At the Least you can provide us the schedule so that we can reassure our leadership that this is being actively worked on by CoSoSys (Netwrix).

 

Furthermore, we have consistently requested for information regarding backward compatibility with the Hotfix for the Agent, yet no response has been forthcoming.

 

@Sara – You had assured us that this issue would be promptly addressed, but there has been no progress so far.

 

Your urgent attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Manpreet,

My understanding is that for  hosted by us customers, the server vulnerability patching will be performed by our devops team.
But I will double check this internally and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Sara/Adrian/Alin,

 

As of today, which is the end of the week we are yet to receive any update regarding the application of the Hotfix for the Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities. If there is a delay on your end, kindly arrange a session so that we can proceed with manual application of the hotfix. Additionally, we seek clarification on the backward compatibility with our Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5 before we move forward.

 

I would like to inform you that following the upgrade of our servers to version 5.9.3.0, alongside Production EPP client version 5.9.3.5, we have not encountered any major issues in our environment (if this information is helpful). Currently, approximately 13,200 machines are running on version 5.9.3.5, while only 800 machines are on version 6.2.2.1.

 

We have been awaiting your response since last Thursday. Could you please provide us with the exact steps to proceed at your earliest convenience?

 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Alin,

 

What is the update on the Hotfix installation. I see that this has not been pushed during the weekend.

Also I do not see any updates on our questions regarding backward compatibility with previous Client version.
