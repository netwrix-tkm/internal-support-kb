I apply the patch in the console and it says 100% installed but when i refresh the screen to check for more patches it shows the same hotfix needs to be installed.  I rebooted the server and installed the patch again and it still shows it needs to be installed.  Please help.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","1.0","Closed - Resolved","Uniphore","Walt McClelland","2024-07-08T22:00:46.000Z","2024-07-09T21:44:12.000Z"
