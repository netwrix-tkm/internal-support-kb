Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We are aware of the hotfix update that appears in the list of ""Available EPP Software Updates"" after it was already applied and it still appears in the list after a Server reboot.  We are currently investigating this issue and will notify you the moment we have found a resolution.


Kind regards
