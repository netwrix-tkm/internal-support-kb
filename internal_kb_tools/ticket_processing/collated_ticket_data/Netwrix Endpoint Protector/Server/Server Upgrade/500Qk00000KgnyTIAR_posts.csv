We currently have 2 different Consoles of EPP in our environment. We are planning to upgrade it to the latest and stable version. we need to know:

1. What is the Latest and Stable Version?
2. Is there any downtime involved during this activity?
3. What is the upgrade path based on the current versions mentioned below.
4. Is there backward compatibility available between the Client and Server?
5. Can Server be on new version and client be on old version? 
EPP MAC - 5.5.0.0
EPP Windows - 5.8.1.0

Also, I wanted to understand that EPP Clients works based on the policy received from the Server so in any case if the server is getting upgraded the only functionality we would lose is the ability of the client to receive any policy changes, Right?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-16T11:26:37.000Z"

They had 16 million event logs entries, database partition was not enabled, because of this the update patch to 5.6.5.0 kept on failing as Ubuntu 14 does not have the capability to partition such large databases.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-18T06:08:37.000Z"
