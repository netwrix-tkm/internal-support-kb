Good day!
We would like to seek your advice on how to check if the offline update for the hotfix has been applied.
We have tried to apply the offline hotfix, but there was no indication that the update was applied.

We checked on the EPP Server's logs, under Admin Actions, and found the log where it shows ""applyManualPatch"".

Clicking further into this log, we see the ""Before"" Value to be empty, and the ""After"" value to be ""/var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/web/uploads/manualpatch_1722876234""

We want to check and clarify if this manual patch version can be used to justify the hotfix being applied to the EPP server?

Thank you!
