Please do the following:

SELECT value FROM sysinfo WHERE name = 'eppversion';

If the version is other than 5.9.3.0, please update it;

UPDATE sysinfo set value = ' 5.9.3.0' where name = 'eppversion';

SELECT id, code, remarks, version, applied_date, installed FROM live_update; (provide a screenshot with the result)

Try to apply the 5.9.4.0 again. If the problem persists revert the changes and provide us the entire content of update_HWA-EPP4-U0065.txt log file.

We had a new session with the customer and performed the provided commands. 

The issue persist. I have attached a few screenshots with the version and with the error from the .txt file, which the customer said they will provide it.

In the remote session from 04th Nov., I tried to reapply the 5.9.4.0 patch, but without success.
I received the following error: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySql server has gone away.

During the updating process, the patch stops at the ""Backing up all files and the database"" step.
I checked the DB size, and it seems to be around 15 G.

I also checked the number of logs and I noticed that even though the partitions were activated, they were not created.
cf_logs ~ 5 mil. of logs
olog ~ 1.5 mil of logs
ofiletrace - contains 3 or 4 partitions

I tried to run manually the partiton.php script, and it was stoped by the following error:  HY000 Lost connection to MYSQL server during query


I logged into MySql and ran the same SQL command and I received the same error.

I enabled the MySQL logs but nothing helpful was logged. (please see the attachments)
I also checked the MySQL config file. (screenshots attached )

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan could you please ask someone from the devops teams for some advice? 

Thanks,
Augustina

There is a remote connection scheduled for tomorrow with server dev and customer.

We have tried to recover the database by removing ib_logfile* from /var/eppfiles/mysql as well as by trying different options for innodb_force_recovery. As long as I was inside the connection nothing worked. Daniel was advised to use also other values for innodb_force_recovery and if that didn't work, to use latest database from /var/eppfiles/backup/patches along with EPPServer files.
