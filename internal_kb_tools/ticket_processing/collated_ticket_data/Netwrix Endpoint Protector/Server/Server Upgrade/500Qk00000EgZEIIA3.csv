I know its possible to update the server from 5.6.0.0 to the latest version, and Sidia needs to do this but they dont have partitions enabled. Since its a airgapped server, is really hard to have a remote session to enable it, if the update were done on the border (opening it to the internet to update only) the partition would be enabled automatically?

Best regards,","","","","patches were applied","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","35.2","Closed - Resolved","Sidia Instituto de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-08-20T15:59:32.000Z","2024-09-24T21:25:40.000Z"
