We are being asked by our internal security team to upgrade the base OS on the appliance or migrate to a new version.  We don't know how to accomplish this since this is a virtual appliance and have no updates relating to the internal update mechanism in EPP.","","We have requested an AWS AMI to be shared with the customer.","After the AMI is shared by DevOps and the customer deploys it to AWS, we will perform the data migration from the old server to the new one.","The customer has requested an AWS EPP Server image and our support with migrating from the old server to the new one.
Everything went fine with the server and endpoints migration and we have the confirmation from the customer to close this ticket as resolved.","","Iosif Muntean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","13.9","Closed - Resolved","GUIDEWIRE","Brett Atwell","2024-11-26T17:49:41.000Z","2024-12-10T16:02:15.000Z"
