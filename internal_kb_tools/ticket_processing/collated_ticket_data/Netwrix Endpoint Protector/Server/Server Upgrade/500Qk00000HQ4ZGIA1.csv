Customer name is PrivatBank.
They found many vulnerabilities in their Test EPP server based on Ubuntu 22.
When we tried to apply an security update from the Live update and then on the remote session from backend, we've found that this server cannot get the security update from the Ubuntu archive with 80 port.
The last update from the customer is that opening port 80 for unencrypted traffic is prohibited by PrivatBank's security policy.

So, we would like to know if it is possible to apply an offline security update for this server? Can you please clarify that?","","","","customer manage to upgrade the security updates.","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","99.3","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-10-24T07:44:54.000Z","2025-01-31T15:16:00.000Z"
