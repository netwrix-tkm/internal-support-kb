Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
  

	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443


  *   where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  *   where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443


  1.  where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  2.  where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Flaviu, Looks like we received yet another notification about a hotfix that'll need to be applied.

I'll be attempting to apply this hotfix# 1.1 this morning. Do you happen to know if there is a new client version that'll need to be deployed as well that is not yet at public release?

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443


  1.  where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  2.  where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Flaviu, Looks like we received yet another notification about a hotfix that’ll need to be applied.

 

I’ll be attempting to apply this hotfix# 1.1 this morning. Do you happen to know if there is a new client version that’ll need to be deployed as well that is not yet at public release?

Hi Chaitanya,

If you would like we can schedule a quick remote session today and we can apply it together.

This Hotfix contains another fix compared to the previous one which was released last week.

For the time being we do not have any updates regarding the EPP clients.

Hi Flaviu, Looks like we received yet another notification about a hotfix that'll need to be applied.

I'll be attempting to apply this hotfix# 1.1 this morning. Do you happen to know if there is a new client version that'll need to be deployed as well that is not yet at public release?

Thank you,

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443


  1.  where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  2.  where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Chaitanya,

If you would like we can schedule a quick remote session today and we can apply it together.

This Hotfix contains another fix compared to the previous one which was released last week.

For the time being we do not have any updates regarding the EPP clients.

Hi Flaviu, Looks like we received yet another notification about a hotfix that’ll need to be applied.

 

I’ll be attempting to apply this hotfix# 1.1 this morning. Do you happen to know if there is a new client version that’ll need to be deployed as well that is not yet at public release?

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
  


	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Chaitanya,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the 5930 EPP server patch and also the vulnerability patch + provided the new Windows agent for the vulnerability patch.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Chaitanya,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443


  1.  where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  2.  where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Chaitanya,

If you would like we can schedule a quick remote session today and we can apply it together.

This Hotfix contains another fix compared to the previous one which was released last week.

For the time being we do not have any updates regarding the EPP clients.

Hi Flaviu, Looks like we received yet another notification about a hotfix that’ll need to be applied.

 

I’ll be attempting to apply this hotfix# 1.1 this morning. Do you happen to know if there is a new client version that’ll need to be deployed as well that is not yet at public release?
