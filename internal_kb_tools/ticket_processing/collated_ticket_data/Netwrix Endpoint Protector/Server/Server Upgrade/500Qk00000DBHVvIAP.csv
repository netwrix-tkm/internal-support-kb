"500Qk00000DBHVvIAP","00415231","Support Ticket","Upgrade Download Entitlement","Hi,
we are currently creating a new appliance (V. 5.8.1.0) but we need to import Backup v2 EPP files from an old installation (V.5.6.0.0). Could you please entitle me to the necessary prodct downloads, so we can advance in this step?

The current install is licensed und 2025-09-06 and includes 150 devices to be managed.

Unfortunately I do no longer have the ability to download it myself, since the portal has been migrated to netwrix.

Thanks in advance and kind regards,
Wolfgang Holst","","","","Confirmed by cust","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","50.3","Closed - Resolved","Diehl Metall","Wolfgang Holst","2024-07-17T08:47:31.000Z","2024-09-05T15:47:43.000Z"
