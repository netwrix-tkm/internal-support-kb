Just a quick question if you don't mind?

I am looking to update our Server Version next week, though to put this through our Change Board, we are required to provide a backout plan where possible.

If the worst came to the worst and a new server version was not suitable for us, would you be able to roll back to a previous version on your end (as you host the server for us) or would this not be possible?

Many Thanks for your time,
Conor","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-02T15:24:38.000Z"
