Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We have migrated our ticketing system over to the Netwrix portal, new tickets can only be opened via the Netwrix support portal.

We will need to have a remote session to address the issue of EPP Appliance not being able to apply software updates.  We will need to access the back-end of the EPP appliance via SSH, as the appliance is hosted in AWS you may need to add your local IP to the allow-list to gain access.

Can we schedule a remote session for today at 3PM SA time?


Kind regards

Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  As discussed on our call, I am consulting with our Server team internally regarding the fact that the Server UI loads for you on port 443 when the nginx configuration is set to only allow port 8443.
I will get back to you the moment I have received their feedback.

Can I ask you to confirm the URL for the EPP Server login that can be access externally please?
Is it: https://34.248.81.180:8443/ ?

When I try to access this URL with port 8443 it hangs and does not load the login page.
On port 443 I get ""403 Forbidden nginx"" which is expected but you are able to load the login page.

Is this the correct external URL?

Hi,

It works for me but won't for you as your IP is not allowed. Only my IP and the Cloudflare IP addresses are allowed for 8443 traffic to connect in.
