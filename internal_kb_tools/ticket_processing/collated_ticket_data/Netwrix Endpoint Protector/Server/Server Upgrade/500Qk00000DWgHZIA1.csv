Hello,
I have an offline version of the EPP server 5.9.0.0, I would need to upgrade to the latest version 5.9.3.0. I can't find package 5.9.3.0 on the website, could you please release the offline version 5.9.3.0 or send the procedure for upgrading. Do I need to install intermediate steps 5.9.1.0 and 5.9.2.0? Well thank you","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","NONE","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Orange Cyber Defense (ex Telecom Systems SA)","","2024-07-25T05:49:22.000Z","2024-07-25T09:31:55.000Z"
