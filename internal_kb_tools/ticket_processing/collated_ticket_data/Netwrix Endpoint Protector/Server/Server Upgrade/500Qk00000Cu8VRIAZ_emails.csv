Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and saw that the EPP Server hotfix was applied.

We did not see any CAP logs from today so we will leave this ticket open till next week to make sure that they are received on your end.

Please find below the EPP clients containing the Vulnerability fix on the client side. We recommend pushing them out via an MDM tool or something similar:

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
