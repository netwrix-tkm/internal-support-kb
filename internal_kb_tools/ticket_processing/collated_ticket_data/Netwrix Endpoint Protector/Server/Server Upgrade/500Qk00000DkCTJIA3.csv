-The system installs the update, i get the patch applied successfully screen.
-The updates gets removed from the avaiable updates list
-If i press check for updates the update is listed as avaiable again
-I have installed it like 6 times, still the same problem.

+ Two old 2022 product updates are grayed out, only the cancel schedule prompt is avaiable. If i press the button the result is: The update cannot be cancelled because it has begun running.... but the updates wont install.","","","","The issue with vulnerabilities got fixed meanwhile","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","38.0","Closed - Resolved","Stephani Hungaria Gepgyarto Kft.","Rendszergazda Rendszergazda","2024-07-30T08:59:00.000Z","2024-09-06T08:36:25.000Z"
