Following the upgrade of the EPP server to version 5.9.4, we are currently unable to access the web console, though the server is still responding to pings.

As this is our production server, your prompt assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and best regards.","","","","details provided","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","1.3","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2024-08-08T05:30:03.000Z","2024-08-09T12:28:53.000Z"
