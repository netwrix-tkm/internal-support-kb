In this case, the procedure is to migrate the data and settings from the old server to a new one.

- In order to share the latest EPP appliance with you, please provide your AWS Account ID and the Region.
- After our DevOps colleagues share the new appliance image, you have to install it, and then we will schedule a remote session to perform the migration procedure.

If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
