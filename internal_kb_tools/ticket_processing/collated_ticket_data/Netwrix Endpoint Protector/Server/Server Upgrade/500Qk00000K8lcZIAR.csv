Just a quick question if you don't mind?

I am looking to update our Server Version next week, though to put this through our Change Board, we are required to provide a backout plan where possible.

If the worst came to the worst and a new server version was not suitable for us, would you be able to roll back to a previous version on your end (as you host the server for us) or would this not be possible?

Many Thanks for your time,
Conor","","","","answered all of the cstomer's concerns regarding roll-backs","","Eduard Nut","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","Conor Lane","2025-01-02T15:24:37.000Z","2025-01-02T15:59:38.000Z"
