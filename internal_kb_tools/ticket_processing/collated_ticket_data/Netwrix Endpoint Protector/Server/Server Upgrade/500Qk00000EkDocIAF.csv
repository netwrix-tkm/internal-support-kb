The server is still on 5.9.3.0 as of this morning. There is still the ""Cancel Schedule"" button on the update, so I am not sure what schedule it is using.","","","","Upgraded manually the EPP server.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Hughes Federal Credit Union","Zach Metz","2024-08-21T15:25:28.000Z","2024-08-22T20:55:16.000Z"
