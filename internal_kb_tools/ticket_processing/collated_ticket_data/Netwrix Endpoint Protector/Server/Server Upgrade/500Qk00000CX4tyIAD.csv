As the title says, we need the offline patchs to upgrade the server from 5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0 so we can apply the hotfix and keep the server healthy. The server is a marine airgapped machine so it cannot access internet by no means.

Best regards,","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002

We did the following:
- made a snapshot
- checked and there was space available - the reason they got that message with low disk space was because of a but in 5.8.1.0. We were on 5.9.0.0 so it was fixed
- upgraded the EPP server
- applied the offline server vulnerability patch
- applied the offline client vulnerability patch","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","24.0","Closed - Resolved","FcBrasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-07-01T18:07:39.000Z","2024-07-25T19:00:14.000Z"
