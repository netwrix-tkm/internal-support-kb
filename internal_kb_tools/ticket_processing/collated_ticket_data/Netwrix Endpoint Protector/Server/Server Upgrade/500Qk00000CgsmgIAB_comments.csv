Hi,

If the DevOps applied the hotfix, it is not necessarily that the client applied again the hotfix event he appeared in the Applied EPP Software Updates.

To remove the progress bar, please check if update_HWA-EPP4-U8800.json exists in the path:

--- CODE ---
ls -la /var/log/epp/update_HWA-EPP4-U8800.json
--- CODE ---

If it exists, please remove the file

--- CODE ---
1. rm /var/log/epp/update_HWA-EPP4-U8800.json
--- CODE ---

2. Rum the Mysql commands:

--- CODE ---
2.1. DELETE from syscommands where name = 'update' and value = 'HWA-EPP4-U8800';
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
2.2. DELETE FROM live_update WHERE code like  'HWA-EPP4-U8800%' and installed = 0 ;
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
2.3. UPDATE sysinfo set value = '' WHERE name = 'last_update_code';
--- CODE ---

3. Logout and login to UI
