"500Qk00000DB5g1IAD","00415207","Support Ticket","Huawei Applies for The Offline Patch for The Security Vulnerabilities","Dear Sir/Madam,

I submit this ticket on behalf of Hefeng from Huawei. Recently he received the notification regarding the patch for the security vulnerabilities (ADV-2024-002 – Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify). Therefore, he applies for the offline patch. Because their environment cannot connect to the Internet. Looking forward to your reply. Thanks a lot in advance.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","NONE","","8.1","Closed - Resolved","RESTRICTED –  Quast","Jessica Zhang","2024-07-17T05:50:54.000Z","2024-07-25T08:18:32.000Z"
