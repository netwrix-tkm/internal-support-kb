Hi Bernard,

Please reboot your server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance, and if the installation bar still shows up after the reboot, please send me a screenshot of it so I can escalate this internally:

 Hi Botond,

 

thank you. It looks like the server still tries to apply the update though, although I tried to cancel it. Is there a way to “clean” the status?

 

Thank you,

Bernhard

Hi Bernhard,

I received the confirmation from one of my colleagues from the DevOps team that your server was patched by them.

Hello Bernhard,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We will need to schedule a remote session with you to delete the erroneous patch and try again to apply this time with the offline patch.
Could you please confirm your time zone and availability for a remote session?


Kind regards
