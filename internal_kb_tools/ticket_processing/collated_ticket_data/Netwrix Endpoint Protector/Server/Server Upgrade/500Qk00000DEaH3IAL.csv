While going to Dashboard > Live Update, it shows there’s an update available , but after applying the actual update, the ""there's an update available"" doesn't disseapear. so it’s unclear if the update actually applied successfully. Please advice.

I have screenshot to show, but cannot upload them here,

Kind regards,
