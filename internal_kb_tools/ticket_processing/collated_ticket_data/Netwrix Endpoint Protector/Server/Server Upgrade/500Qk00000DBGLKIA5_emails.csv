Thank you for your email.
We are aware of the lingering hotfix 1.1 patch, which won't go away even after being applied.
For now, you may disregard it, this will be addressed with teh next server version release, a bit later on.
As for the versionings, they will not increase, as this patch addresses some server vulnerabilities, you should have received some communication about this- if not, let me know and I can forward it to you once more.

Also- if you choose to update the clients as well, you can apply this patch here
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz  
in Live Update- Offline Patch upload- and then, you will have updated client versions to deploy straight from the console
if needed .

No unpacking is needed, simply upload it as it is and you would be good to go.

Thank you for your email.
Indeed there is no cinfirmation mesage after uploading the patch- but if you go back 
to the Live Update screen, you should have had a progress bar.
Regardless, you can check from View Applied EPP SOftware Updates if the patch itself was applied- it should be called Product update...
