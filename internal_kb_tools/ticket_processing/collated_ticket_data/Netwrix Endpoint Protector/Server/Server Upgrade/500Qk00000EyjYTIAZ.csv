As discussed during the weekly call, we confirmed that we are going to proceed with the 5.9.4 upgrade in the Prod server.
Similar to the process we had in the Dev, can we have a 30min session to confirm the upgrade successfully completed in the backend today sometime between 15:00-17:00 NL time?
Thanks,
-serhat","","","","The update was successfully applied. The questions they raised were replied in the following tickets:
