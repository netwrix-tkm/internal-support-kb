Yes, I was referring to 12.00 IST of course.
The current server version should be 5.9.3.0, so only two more patches would need to be applied.
You can achieve this form the console- Dashboard- Live Update-check now- apply 1-st, check now, and apply
2-nd one.

Hello Adrian,

The 2nd seems to be stuck, we are able to see that in the update section the update as been applied yet the update is available in the updates section.
Also we can't get the cli access to the server now.

Thank you for your email.
Please disregard the hotfix 1.1 upgrade, this will not go away since it will still linger even if it was applied, so you can disregard it.
This will get fix, and if the update was applied will go away, with our next server version release, 5.9.4.0.
