If you are on the latest version of the EPP server, 5.9.3.0, please check again now. The upgrade containing the fix should be available now.

Before applying the upgrade/fix, we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP server.

If you would like we can schedule a quick remote session and we can apply the upgrade/fix together.

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
macOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
  
 

	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

The Vulnerability fix was applied on your end.

As we spoke we provided the download links for Windows and macOS agents and the SCCM syntax for deployment.

We asked that you reach out to us on Tuesday or Wednesday to see if we have any updates on the Offline Client Patches - which would help in upgrading the clients from the EPP console.

Hi Martin,

Thank you for the remote session!

The Vulnerability fix was applied on your end.

As we spoke we provided the download links for Windows and macOS agents and the SCCM syntax for deployment.

We asked that you reach out to us on Tuesday or Wednesday to see if we have any updates on the Offline Client Patches - which would help in upgrading the clients from the EPP console.

Hi Martin,

If you are on the latest version of the EPP server, 5.9.3.0, please check again now. The upgrade containing the fix should be available now.

Before applying the upgrade/fix, we strongly recommend creating a Snapshot of the EPP server.

If you would like we can schedule a quick remote session and we can apply the upgrade/fix together.

Hi Martin,

Thank you for the remote session!

The Vulnerability fix was applied on your end.

As we spoke we provided the download links for Windows and macOS agents and the SCCM syntax for deployment.

We asked that you reach out to us on Tuesday or Wednesday to see if we have any updates on the Offline Client Patches - which would help in upgrading the clients from the EPP console.

Hi Martin,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
macOS:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
 
 


	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Martin,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9DZhPaVg$>
macOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar<https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar>

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$> WSPORT=443



  1.  where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
  2.  where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com__;!!BgP4bux2U46jjw!HK1C9RzJKRwwIQy3Nuql3bb4M2s2cmLNxpLE416a0_zeYmSCjeRv9BAxrTNESih0y63owmuezfO56povMRE9-hRuYyw$>"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

It is possible for the behavior to be caused by the large amount of logs being sent to the server from the EPP clients. They did not send the logs since the 28th of June and are now sending them. Normally once all the logs are sent the resource consumption should be back to normal.

If the issue persists in about 2 hours please let me know and we will schedule another remote session and take a look.

Hi Martin,

Thank you for the remote session!

The Vulnerability fix was applied on your end.

As we spoke we provided the download links for Windows and macOS agents and the SCCM syntax for deployment.

We asked that you reach out to us on Tuesday or Wednesday to see if we have any updates on the Offline Client Patches - which would help in upgrading the clients from the EPP console.

Hi Martin,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
macOS:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
 
 


	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.

Hi Martin,

It is possible for the behavior to be caused by the large amount of logs being sent to the server from the EPP clients. They did not send the logs since the 28th of June and are now sending them. Normally once all the logs are sent the resource consumption should be back to normal.

If the issue persists in about 2 hours please let me know and we will schedule another remote session and take a look.

Hi Martin,

It is possible for the behavior to be caused by the large amount of logs being sent to the server from the EPP clients. They did not send the logs since the 28th of June and are now sending them. Normally once all the logs are sent the resource consumption should be back to normal.

If the issue persists in about 2 hours please let me know and we will schedule another remote session and take a look.

Hi Flaviu, after this last hotfix the CPU on the VM is at 100% and console is unresponsive, is this normal?

Hi Martin,

Thank you for the remote session!

The Vulnerability fix was applied on your end.

As we spoke we provided the download links for Windows and macOS agents and the SCCM syntax for deployment.

We asked that you reach out to us on Tuesday or Wednesday to see if we have any updates on the Offline Client Patches - which would help in upgrading the clients from the EPP console.

Hi Martin,

Please find below the steps to deploy the EPP client using msiexec.

Download link for agent:
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
macOS:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Commands:
msiexec.exe /i "" msiPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart
 
E.g.
msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" /qn /norestart

Note1: /norestart is optional

Note2: if using FQDN please adapt the above template with the below:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com WSPORT=443
 
 


	where EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi is the name of the installer. If your installed also has an IP in the name, the IP needs to be removed from the MSI name.
	where ""mycompany.endpoinprotector.server.com"" has to be replaced with the IP or the FQDN correspondent to your EPP server.
