"500Qk00000Cu8VRIAZ","00414675","Support Ticket","hotfix 1.1 not being applied","Hello,
 
Based on email alerts, I had applied the available hotfixes over the last 2 weeks.
 
Most recently, I applied hotfix 1.1 on Monday and on screen notification said update applied successfully.
 
I noticed today that hotfix 1.1 was still being listed as an available update.
 
Iâ€™ve tried applying it again 2 more times and have tried rebooting the instance and it is still showing as an available update.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","61.9","Closed - Resolved","Brightidea","Michael Corridon","2024-07-10T18:14:34.000Z","2024-09-10T16:40:02.000Z"
