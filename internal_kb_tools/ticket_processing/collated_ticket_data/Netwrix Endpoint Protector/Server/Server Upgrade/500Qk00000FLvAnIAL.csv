"500Qk00000FLvAnIAL","00420086","Support Ticket","Is a new security update required?","Treasury applied Hotfix #1 for server v5.9.3.0 to mitigate the issue ADV-2024-002 on 11 July 2024.  The code of that update is MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800_5930.

Today we received notification of an updated to ADV-2024-002, and it appears there was a new version of Hotfix #1 relreased on 16 July according to the security advice.

The update file we download refers to MP-HWA-EPP5-U8800-M0002.  Can you confirm please that M0002 is a new version of Hotfix #1 that we must install?  Referring it to Hotfix #1 again is confusing.

Cheers
