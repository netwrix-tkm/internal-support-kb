Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime. 

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present. 

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version. 

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly. 

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for reaching out !!

We can assist you to upgrade the OS for the EPP server by creating a new VM with the Ubuntu 22.04 as OS and then using the System backup V2 feature to migrate the database (entities, rights, settings, policies, con?gurations, etc.).

!System Backup v2 does not include logs, Audits or System Backups.

In order to perform these steps we can schedule a remote session for the next week. 

Could you please share with us your availability ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

We have received the confirmation and are good to proceed with the upgrade process. As an initial step, we will upgrade the EPP server version to 5.9.4.0 and also upgrade the client versions.

To move forward, would you prefer to connect over a call to discuss the details, or shall we proceed directly with the upgrade. Kindly let me know your preference if yes we can connect today. Thanks

Note: I Will have the VM Snapshot taken care of.

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime.

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present.

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version.

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly.

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

We have received the confirmation and are good to proceed with the upgrade process. As an initial step, we will upgrade the EPP server version to 5.9.4.0 and also upgrade the client versions.

To move forward, would you prefer to connect over a call to discuss the details, or shall we proceed directly with the upgrade. Kindly let me know your preference if yes we can connect today. Thanks

Note: I Will have the VM Snapshot taken care of.

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime.

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present.

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version.

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly.

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for reaching out !!

We can assist you to upgrade the OS for the EPP server by creating a new VM with the Ubuntu 22.04 as OS and then using the System backup V2 feature to migrate the database (entities, rights, settings, policies, con?gurations, etc.).

!System Backup v2 does not include logs, Audits or System Backups.

In order to perform these steps we can schedule a remote session for the next week.

Could you please share with us your availability ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar, 

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime. 

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present. 

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version. 

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly. 

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Daniel,

 

We have received the confirmation and are good to proceed with the upgrade process. As an initial step, we will upgrade the EPP server version to 5.9.4.0 and also upgrade the client versions.

 

To move forward, would you prefer to connect over a call to discuss the details, or shall we proceed directly with the upgrade. Kindly let me know your preference if yes we can connect today. Thanks

Hello Manojkumar, 

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime. 

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present. 

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version. 

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly. 

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime.

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present.

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version.

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly.

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar, 

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime. 

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present. 

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version. 

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly. 

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for reaching out !!

We can assist you to upgrade the OS for the EPP server by creating a new VM with the Ubuntu 22.04 as OS and then using the System backup V2 feature to migrate the database (entities, rights, settings, policies, con?gurations, etc.).

!System Backup v2 does not include logs, Audits or System Backups.

In order to perform these steps we can schedule a remote session for the next week. 

Could you please share with us your availability ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

 

We have received the confirmation and are good to proceed with the upgrade process. As an initial step, we will upgrade the EPP server version to 5.9.4.0 and also upgrade the client versions.

 

To move forward, would you prefer to connect over a call to discuss the details, or shall we proceed directly with the upgrade. Kindly let me know your preference if yes we can connect today. Thanks

 

Note: I Will have the VM Snapshot taken care of.

 


Regards,

Manojkumar.M

Hello Manojkumar, 

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have discussed the following details regarding the possibility of creating a new EPP server.

First of all, you will have to create a SNAPSHOT from the virtualisation environment to have a point of return in case the next step fail.

Once the snapshot is taken, since the current EPP server version is at 5.9.2.0 we will bring it to the 5.9.4.0 version which will allow us to create the new EPP server with the 5.9.4.0 version directly.

The next step will be to take a System Backup V2 from the existing EPP console to backup the database, policies, rights and all the configuration made, so we can import them in the new EPP VM .  The backup file and the password should be stored locally so we can use them later.

Next we need to download the EPP VM image and to create the new VM into your virtualisation environment. After the creation we will assign the desired vCPUs and RAMs and start the machine, to assign the network details. While the settings are filled in, we need to shut down the old EPP VM.
Here we will use the same IP as the old EPP VM, so that the existing clients can communicate directly with the new VM, without creating a downtime. 

As soon as the details are added and the new EPP VM is up and running, we will connect to the EPP web console to import the System backup V2, then we will refresh the entire web page and check if the rules / policies / computers / details  are present. 

The next step will be to update the EPP version to the latest one 5.9.4.1 and to upgrade the EPP clients using the latest client version. 

Finally, we will require to test the communication between the server and one client to verify if it is made correctly. 

Please check with your management team all the details and let us know when we can schedule a new session to perform the above steps .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for your response.

We have arranged a remote session for tomorrow  at 13:30 IST and sent you the details in a separate email.
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Manojkumar,

Thank you for reaching out !!

We can assist you to upgrade the OS for the EPP server by creating a new VM with the Ubuntu 22.04 as OS and then using the System backup V2 feature to migrate the database (entities, rights, settings, policies, con?gurations, etc.).

!System Backup v2 does not include logs, Audits or System Backups.

In order to perform these steps we can schedule a remote session for the next week. 

Could you please share with us your availability ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Apologies for the delay in responding ‚Äî I was on extended leave last week.

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn‚Äôt work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

They‚Äôve requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

Dear Daniel,

Apologies for the delay in responding - I was on extended leave last week.

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn't work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

They've requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

Regards,
Manojkumar.M

Hello Manojkumar,

I'm reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven't heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you're all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out-I'm here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00440316
Ticket Subject: Need to Upgrade the Server OS version and Migrate the Data
Ticket Details: We would like to have the Server OS upgraded to the latest version, since the current OS version is Ubuntu 18.04 and we would like to have them upgraded. We also would like to retain/move the Data captured. Kindly help us in upgrading the servers. Thanks

Thank you!

Daniel Anton

Dear Daniel,

 

Apologies for the delay in responding ‚Äî I was on extended leave last week.

 

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn‚Äôt work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

 

They‚Äôve requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

Dear Daniel,

We have launched a new EC2 instance in AWS using the image file that was recently shared. However, during the validation process, only 2 out of 3 checks passed, resulting in a ""validation check failed"" status.

Upon further investigation through the AWS server screenshot, we encountered the below in the attached screenshots. Unfortunately, we are also unable to access the instance via SSH.

[cid:image001.jpg@01DBB470.3F381B20]

[cid:image002.jpg@01DBB470.3F381B20]

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:

  *   Ensure the instance is launched successfully in AWS
  *   Assist with the migration to the new server

Please let us know a convenient time to schedule a call along with your support team. If any additional details are required from our side, please let me know. Thanks

Note: We have followed the steps shared in the support document provided.

Dear Daniel,

 

Apologies for the delay in responding ‚Äî I was on extended leave last week.

 

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn‚Äôt work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

 

They‚Äôve requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

 


Regards,

Manojkumar.M

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have installed the EPP server image (VHDX) on your AWS environment and encounter the following error : ""Instance reachability check failed"" . 

Could you please request the AMI as described in the kb article ? 
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/AmazonWebServices/Amazon.htm

In this way you should receive an new image to install it on your AWS environment.

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

 

We have launched a new EC2 instance in AWS using the image file that was recently shared. However, during the validation process, only 2 out of 3 checks passed, resulting in a ""validation check failed"" status.

 

Upon further investigation through the AWS server screenshot, we encountered the below in the attached screenshots. Unfortunately, we are also unable to access the instance via SSH.

 



 



 

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:


	Ensure the instance is launched successfully in AWS
	Assist with the migration to the new server


 

Please let us know a convenient time to schedule a call along with your support team. If any additional details are required from our side, please let me know. Thanks

 

Note: We have followed the steps shared in the support document provided.

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:

Hello Manoj,

I hope my email finds you well.

Have you manage to create the EPP new VM in the AWS environment?
Did you encounter any issues?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Following the guide to deploy an image on AWS, can you please confirm if you were able to obtain the AMI by requesting it from your Endpoint Protector sales representative directly or submit a request to your Customer Management lead?

Dear Daniel,

Apologies for the delay in responding - I was on extended leave last week.

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn't work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

They've requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

Dear Daniel,

 

We attempted to relaunch the virtual machine by converting the VHDX file to VHD format; however, we are still encountering the same error. Kindly consult with your team and provide us with the image in VHD format that is compatible with AWS infrastructure. Thanks

In the meeting we have installed the EPP server image (VHDX) on your AWS environment and encounter the following error : ""Instance reachability check failed"" .

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NQoX2:ref

 


Dear Daniel,

 

We have launched a new EC2 instance in AWS using the image file that was recently shared. However, during the validation process, only 2 out of 3 checks passed, resulting in a ""validation check failed"" status.

 

Upon further investigation through the AWS server screenshot, we encountered the below in the attached screenshots. Unfortunately, we are also unable to access the instance via SSH.

 



 



 

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:


	Ensure the instance is launched successfully in AWS
	Assist with the  migration to the new server


 

Please let us know a convenient time to schedule a call along with your support team. If any additional details are required from our side, please let me know. Thanks

 

Note: We have followed the steps shared in the support document provided.

Manojkumar.M

Dear Daniel,

We attempted to retrieve the image but were unsuccessful. Based on our understanding, a support engineer from Netwrix may be able to request and provide the necessary image. Would you be able to assist us in obtaining the AMI so we can get the VM up and running. We're happy to connect over a call to discuss this further if needed. Thanks

Regards,

Hello Manoj,

Thank you for your response.

Could you please request the AMI as described in the kb article ?

In this way you should receive an new image to install it on your AWS environment.

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

We attempted to relaunch the virtual machine by converting the VHDX file to VHD format; however, we are still encountering the same error. Kindly consult with your team and provide us with the image in VHD format that is compatible with AWS infrastructure. Thanks

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NQoX2:ref


Dear Daniel,

We have launched a new EC2 instance in AWS using the image file that was recently shared. However, during the validation process, only 2 out of 3 checks passed, resulting in a ""validation check failed"" status.

Upon further investigation through the AWS server screenshot, we encountered the below in the attached screenshots. Unfortunately, we are also unable to access the instance via SSH.

[cid:image001.jpg@01DBB951.90440CF0]

[cid:image002.jpg@01DBB951.90440CF0]

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:

  1.  Ensure the instance is launched successfully in AWS
  2.  Assist with the migration to the new server

Please let us know a convenient time to schedule a call along with your support team. If any additional details are required from our side, please let me know. Thanks

Note: We have followed the steps shared in the support document provided.

Regards,
Manojkumar.M

Have you manage to create the EPP new VM in the AWS environment?
Did you encounter any issues?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Following the guide to deploy an image on AWS, can you please confirm if you were able to obtain the AMI by requesting it from your Endpoint Protector sales representative directly or submit a request to your Customer Management lead?

Dear Daniel,

Apologies for the delay in responding - I was on extended leave last week.

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn't work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

They've requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks

Hello Manojkumar,

I'm reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven't heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you're all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out-I'm here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Subject: Need to Upgrade the Server OS version and Migrate the Data
Ticket Details: We would like to have the Server OS upgraded to the latest version, since the current OS version is Ubuntu 18.04 and we would like to have them upgraded. We also would like to retain/move the Data captured. Kindly help us in upgrading the servers. Thanks

Thank you!

Dear Daniel,

 

We attempted to retrieve the image but were unsuccessful. Based on our understanding, a support engineer from Netwrix may be able to request and provide the necessary image. Would you be able to assist us in obtaining the AMI so we can get the VM up and running. We‚Äôre happy to connect over a call to discuss this further if needed. Thanks

Hello Manoj,

Thank you for your response. 

Could you please request the AMI as described in the kb article ? 
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/AmazonWebServices/Amazon.htm

In this way you should receive an new image to install it on your AWS environment.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

 

We attempted to relaunch the virtual machine by converting the VHDX file to VHD format; however, we are still encountering the same error. Kindly consult with your team and provide us with the image in VHD format that is compatible with AWS infrastructure. Thanks

In the meeting we have installed the EPP server image (VHDX) on your AWS environment and encounter the following error : ""Instance reachability check failed"" . 

Could you please request the AMI as described in the kb article ?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NQoX2:ref

 


Dear Daniel,

 

We have launched a new EC2 instance in AWS using the image file that was recently shared. However, during the validation process, only 2 out of 3 checks passed, resulting in a ""validation check failed"" status.

 

Upon further investigation through the AWS server screenshot, we encountered the below in the attached screenshots. Unfortunately, we are also unable to access the instance via SSH.

 



 



 

We kindly request you to review this issue and assist in resolving it. Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could coordinate with your image support team to:


	Ensure the instance is launched successfully in AWS
	Assist with the  migration to the new server


 

Please let us know a convenient time to schedule a call along with your support team. If any additional details are required from our side, please let me know. Thanks

 

Note: We have followed the steps shared in the support document provided.

 


Regards,

Manojkumar.M

Hello,

Following the guide to deploy an image on AWS, can you please confirm if you were able to obtain the AMI by requesting it from your Endpoint Protector sales representative directly or submit a request to your Customer Management lead?
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/AmazonWebServices/Amazon.htm

Dear Daniel,

 

Apologies for the delay in responding ‚Äî I was on extended leave last week.

 

In the meantime, Vinoth had followed up with the AWS support team regarding the issue. They attempted to upload the image by downloading it a couple of times; however, it unfortunately still didn‚Äôt work. Based on their investigation, the support team suspects that the image file may be corrupted.

 

They‚Äôve requested if there is an alternative image file available that we can try uploading instead. Could you please check and share any other image file available for this version, that we can use for this purpose in .vhd or .vhdx format. Thanks
