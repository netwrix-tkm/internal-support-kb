I assisted the customer with the migration in a remote session using backup v2.  The migration was successful but after the epp clients re established connection to the new server the last seen time was consistently an hour ahead despite re-synchronizing the time via EPP Server UI under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Maintenance""","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-28T10:50:04.000Z"

The last seen time started to display correctly afterward.  Customer is happy and requested case be closed.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-28T10:51:23.000Z"
