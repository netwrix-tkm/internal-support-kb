"500Qk00000DBGLKIA5","00415228","Support Ticket","EPP server hotfix 1.1","I recently applied EPP Server Hotfix 1.1 to our on-prem server. 
The update appears in the list of applied updates, but it is also listed among the pending updates. 
Additionally, the server and client versions have not changed (they remain at 5.9.3.0 and 6.2.2.1, respectively). Please see the attached screenshots for reference.

Could you advise whether this is a glitch, or if I need to reapply Hotfix 1.1?","","","","Closing this case as Resolved  after confirming with the customer that the Hotfix  was applied successfully.
