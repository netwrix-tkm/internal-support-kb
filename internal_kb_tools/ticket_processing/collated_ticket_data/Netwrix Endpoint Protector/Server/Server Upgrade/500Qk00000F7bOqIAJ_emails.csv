Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to
the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe
you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?
Thank you for checking in.

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Yes that is correct, ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"".

Please let me know once it is installed on your end and we will schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday this week, or any day next week and we will do the migration.

Confirming that the correct ""private AMI"" I'm to select is the one named ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"". My other option is ""Endpoint Protector 5.6.0.0 Virtual Appliance""

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP
instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special
commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you
about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is
accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.
Thanks!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

also, the primary partition is 500G but the allocation on the disks is
significantly less, can we re-allocate the disk storage to utilize the
entire partition?

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

My IP:  90.95.54.129

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Yes that is correct, ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"".

Please let me know once it is installed on your end and we will schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday this week, or any day next week and we will do the migration.

Confirming that the correct ""private AMI"" I'm to select is the one named ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"". My other option is ""Endpoint Protector 5.6.0.0 Virtual Appliance""

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have
confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate
the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;
will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as
the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert
created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host
name we've created
will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?
are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?
please suggest a time this coming week for our next call
Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- created a SSH Access account for you
- re-partitioned the free space on the EPP server

We will wait to hear back from you next week so we can proceed with the migration.

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

My IP:  90.95.54.129

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest
version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been
a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's
still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to
advance beyond this?

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- created a SSH Access account for you
- re-partitioned the free space on the EPP server

We will wait to hear back from you next week so we can proceed with the migration.

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

Confirming that the correct ""private AMI"" I'm to select is the one named ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"". My other option is ""Endpoint Protector 5.6.0.0 Virtual Appliance""

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have received confirmation from our devops team that they have shared the image with you.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Once the image is installed please let me know and we will schedule a remote session to do the migration from the current image to the new one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Hi Jeffrey,

We would need the below information:

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- created a SSH Access account for you
- re-partitioned the free space on the EPP server

We will wait to hear back from you next week so we can proceed with the migration.

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- created a SSH Access account for you
- re-partitioned the free space on the EPP server

We will wait to hear back from you next week so we can proceed with the migration.

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

Confirming that the correct ""private AMI"" I'm to select is the one named ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"". My other option is ""Endpoint Protector 5.6.0.0 Virtual Appliance""

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have received confirmation from our devops team that they have shared the image with you.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Once the image is installed please let me know and we will schedule a remote session to do the migration from the current image to the new one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual inaccuracies.

We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using
the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on
the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the
AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.
If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other
in this coming week, that would be great.
Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.

If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other in this coming week, that would be great.

Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

I have just received confirmation from our devops team that the image has been shared with your AWS account.

AWS AccountId 286622446462 in the us-east-1.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

After installing the image on your end please let me know so we can schedule a remote session in order to do the migration.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual inaccuracies.

We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- created a SSH Access account for you
- re-partitioned the free space on the EPP server

We will wait to hear back from you next week so we can proceed with the migration.

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

My IP:  90.95.54.129

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

>>
>> Thank you for the remote session!

>> As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual
>> inaccuracies.
>>
>> We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server
>> image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.
>>
>> Steps remaining after receiving the image:
>> - installing it on your end
>> - moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
>> - checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
>> - swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so
>> they communicate with the new EPP server.

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.

If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other in this coming week, that would be great.

Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

I have just received confirmation from our devops team that the image has been shared with your AWS account.

AWS AccountId 286622446462 in the us-east-1.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

After installing the image on your end please let me know so we can schedule a remote session in order to do the migration.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual inaccuracies.

We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we migrated the EPP server with System backup V2 and we also resized the partitions.

We will leave this ticket open 1-2 more weeks to make sure that there are no issues till you finish making the last changes.

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.

If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other in this coming week, that would be great.

Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

I have just received confirmation from our devops team that the image has been shared with your AWS account.

AWS AccountId 286622446462 in the us-east-1.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

After installing the image on your end please let me know so we can schedule a remote session in order to do the migration.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual inaccuracies.

We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.

Steps remaining after receiving the image:

- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Yes that is correct, ""Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 Virtual Appliance"".

Please let me know once it is installed on your end and we will schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday this week, or any day next week and we will do the migration.

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.

If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other in this coming week, that would be great.

Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

Unfortunately we were not able to request remote control from our end in order to create the SSH account.

As we spoke I am sending you my IP to see if it can be added in AWS so I can access it from my end and create the account for you.

My IP:  90.95.54.129

Hello Flaviu,
Yes, the instance is up and accessible. I'd love to regain ssh access to the instance, how do I go about obtaining my credentials, which I believe you said were ""baked"" into this AMI?

Thank you for checking in.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke I believe an older EPP Server version was installed. We will wait to hear back from you once the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04 is installed.

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let me know if Thursday or Friday this week work for you, or any day next week for the remote session.

In the meeting we will go over the next migration steps.

Regarding the applications that you want installed we need to see if the form was received and approved on our end.

I am also double checking with our legal team to see if the SSH Access account form was received on our end and also checking to see what other steps need to be taken.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

Thank you,

Hello Flaviu,
the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we migrated the EPP server with System backup V2 and we also resized the partitions.

We will leave this ticket open 1-2 more weeks to make sure that there are no issues till you finish making the last changes.

Hello Flaviu,
New instances is up, I have access to the UI and have updated the OS using the GUI. One additional setup item will be expanding the partition size on the AMI as we did before. Feature request for your dev team, do this on the AMI for you don't have to after the server is turned up.

If you could suggest time to move the settings from one host to the other in this coming week, that would be great.

Thanka for all your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hi Jeffrey,

I have just received confirmation from our devops team that the image has been shared with your AWS account.

AWS AccountId 286622446462 in the us-east-1.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

After installing the image on your end please let me know so we can schedule a remote session in order to do the migration.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we tried upgrading the 5810 image, but it gave some UI visual inaccuracies.

We asked our devops team to share with you the latest AWS EPP server image they have. We will get back to you once it is shared.

Steps remaining after receiving the image:
- installing it on your end
- moving the settings from the old EPP server to the new one
- checking to make sure they are a 1-to-1 match
- swapping the IP's of the 2 servers or updating the EPP client IP's so they communicate with the new EPP server.

Hi Jeffrey,

I believe that that message is received when there is not enough space on the disk for the backups to occur when upgrading.

We can schedule a remote session so we can take a look together and free some space if needed. Please let me know if you have availability this Thursday for a remote session.

We will need port 62828 to be open in AWS for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(Example: your IP).

Hello Flaviu,
Thank you. I'm attempting to update the EPP server instance to the latest version, but it seems to be ""stuck"" at 87.5% ""updating database"". It's been a few days and I just rebooted the host OS, but when I logged back in it's still at the same % as when I restarted. What can I do to get the server to advance beyond this?

Hi Jeffrey,

Please find the answers below:
The EPP clients only care about the IP/DNS/FQDN used. I would recommend only swapping the IP's of the EPP servers, or updating the IP on the EPP clients once the migration is completed.
If we migrate the EPP server the certificates applied on the EPP server should also be present on the new EPP server after the migration is completed.

Regarding the preparatory steps that need to be taken before the migration, I would recommend having a remote session with us when you either migrate so we can assist. The most important steps prior to the migration are:
1. Creating a Snapshot of the EPP servers, so we have a point of return.
2. Making sure that both EPP servers are on the same EPP server version(this can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI, the latest version is 5940).

Please let me know if there is any additional information that we can provide and if/when you would like to schedule a remote session with us to assist with the migration.

Hello Flaviu, 
I've installed all the security agents required on the system and have confirmed it's logging to our SIEMs host, I believe we're ready to migrate the data and settings, but have a few questions, such as;

will the connected clients ""care"" if the new EPP server name is the same as the current host? this relates to whether i need to have a new TLS cert created using the current host name or use one with the current AWS host name we've created

will the Active Directory connector be migrated as a part of the process?

are there additional preparatory steps I should take prior to the migration?

please suggest a time this coming week for our next call

Thanks for your help, hope you have a nice weekend!

Hello Flaviu,
I've used SSM to obtain ""root"" access to the back end of the new EPP instance. I will create a user for myself on the host, is there any special commands I should run to create that user? I also wanted to chat with you about any maintenance task I should perform seeing as the host is accessible. the prompt i'm getting is
"".support_history NOT present.
Create it and add intervention before closing this support session""

 

We can set up some time to review before I make any changes if you'd like.

Thanks!

Hi Jeffrey,

Please let us know if you had a chance to install the 5.8.1.0 EPP server with Ubuntu 22.04.

After that we will proceed with the following steps:

1. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
2. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
3. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
4. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Once we migrate you should have the old server SSH access / host access in order to install the 3rd party tools you mentioned. Before installing them we strongly recommend creating a snapshot of the EPP server.

Thanks for your response. Regarding SSH access, i did complete the SSH access request, which was approved by Blend's legal team. I can dig up the paperwork if needed, but you should def initially have it on file as well. We need to install security tooling like a Tenable agent and to configure the host to log to a kinesis firehose for logging. 
 

Regarding scheduling a call to discuss our next steps, when works best for you?

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Flaviu is on leave today and will return tomorrow. Until then, SSH access is not provided out of the box for our appliance, that involves a legal process where they send a document containing an access addendum that needs to be checked and signed.
If you need to migrate to the new instance, Flaviu will reach out to set up a remote session where he can do just that.

the new EPP EC2 instance is up and running, I can SSH from the legacy server to the new instance using port 62828, but I don't have credentials on the host, aside from the root password mentioned in the doc. Are there credentials you can share or do I need access to the UI to enable ssh access?

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you! I have asked my colleagues from the devops team to share the image with you(EPP server on 5.8.1.0 version with Ubuntu 22.04). We will upgrade the EPP server version afterwards.

We will get back to you once the image is shared.

Hi Jeffrey,

We would need the below information:
 

- AWS Account ID: 

- AWS Region:

After that we will ask our devops team to share the image with you.

Thanks for your reply. I do want to proceed with updating the server OS.
Regarding ""We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you""

What information do you need?

Thanks again!

Hi Jeffrey,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

We can provide you with an AWS image with the EPP server version 5.8.1.0. This we will upgrade afterwards when performing the migration to the latest 5.9.4.0 version.

Unfortunately we only have images on Ubuntu 22.04.

The list of steps to perform the migration would be:
1. Providing you with the Ubuntu 22.04 image in AWS. We would need some information from your side in order to share this image with you.
2. After you install the image on your end and allocate it an IP we will schedule a remote session.
3. We will upgrade the new image to 5.9.4.0.
4. We will perform a System backup V2 migration(which does not contain the logs).
5. You will then have to either swap the IP's between the 2 EPP servers(old and new). This is in order for the EPP clients to connect to the new server and send the logs there from now on.
6. We will make a final check, a comparison between the old and new EPP server to make sure that the new one is a mirrored version of the old one.

Hi Jeffrey,

Thank you for the responses!

Regarding you new questions:
- unfortunately we cannot upgrade the OS directly, we can do this only through a migration to a new image
- when we migrate I believe the latest Ubuntu version that we have available is 22.04

I will check with our colleagues to confirm what the latest Ubuntu image version we have for AWS images.

Hello Flaviu,
thanks for your response.
the Appliance version is ""Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS l""

the new EPP server can share the same network

the EPP server logs are being exported to a SIEMs, so we don't need the logs

the current EPP server version is ""5.9.4.0""

 

Can we do an ""in-place"" update of the OS?. What's the latest version of Ubuntu that EPP can use? Can we go to 24.04?

Hi Jeffrey,

Can you please let us know what your current Ubuntu version is and we will check to see if if have AWS images with a newer version? This can be checked from Appliance ->

This can be checked from Appliance -> Server Information:


We do not have an exact documentation for the migration form an older EPP server to a newer one, but in case we will migrate I will join you in a remote session and we will do the steps together.

A few questions regarding this:
1. Just to confirm, the 2 EPP servers will be on the same network right?
2. Do you want to migrate the Settings, Computers/Users, policies, configurations without the logs? or with/including the logs?
3. What EPP server version are you currently on(this can be checked in the bottom-right corner of the EPP server UI)?
