"500Qk00000CNRa8IAH","00413283","Support Ticket","FCBRASIL - Cant apply the hotfix for the vulnerability","Hello Team,

We received the message about the vulnerability and read the patch that recommends an update for the hotfix #1. if i understood right, the patch should be available on live update already but they have a offline patch for 5.9.3.0, right?
The offline patch is not uploading, it says ""error to apply the update"" and the live update doesnt add a new update to be run. Can you please clarify that part?

Best regards,","","","","server hot fix was applied","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","4.0","Closed - Resolved","FcBrasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-06-27T15:11:11.000Z","2024-07-01T15:09:08.000Z"
