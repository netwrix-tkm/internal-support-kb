We're currently trying to install the 5.9.3.0 Hotfix #1.1 Update as recommended.
When trying to install it (both via Live Update or offline) it returns successfull. However, the same update ist still shown in ""available updates"", as if it weren't installed.
Neither a new login nor a restart of the whole server fixes the problem.

Is there a way to check if the hotfix was actually installed? Or can this issue be ignored?

Thank you for your answer.

Kind regards,
