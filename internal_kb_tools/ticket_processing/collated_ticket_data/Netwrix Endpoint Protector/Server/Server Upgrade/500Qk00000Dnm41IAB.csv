Hi, we are trying to update our Endpoint protector server to the latest version, I received an error message: "" Please Contact Support. (ERROR: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update...)"". I believe this may be related to not having the correct whitelisted IPs/ports for downloading the update. Please share the list of IPs/ports required to download this patch.

Regards,
