This is regarding Security Update Hotfix #1.1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800). We're keen to update our EPP server however before we do is could you please answer the following questions:
Are you aware of any reports of instability or unexpected behaviour/bugs on this Hotfix update?
If we did experience issues is there the means to roll back to a previous 'known-good' server version?

I would really appreciate any help you can provide with this.

Many thanks,
Sam","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","NONE","","69.1","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","lcarney Cordina","2024-08-07T09:28:19.000Z","2024-10-15T11:55:32.000Z"
