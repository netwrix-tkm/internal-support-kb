I've tried to apply the update immediately and schedule it, but neither works. We would like to get it upgraded due to the ADV-2025-001 advisory.","","the patch did not apply, my guess is that it was checked before re-adding the patch to the live server and thus it did not find the correct path.
after another check it worked","closing as the patch applied correctly and the customer confirmed","patch applied successfully","","Eduard Nut","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Hughes Federal Credit Union","Zach Metz","2025-01-21T16:02:57.000Z","2025-01-21T16:50:13.000Z"
