I confirmed with my team that the following ports need to be open:
- 443 for the web UI
- 80 for Live Update
- 22 - this only has to be open when we have to SSH

Regarding security updates, those can be applied from the Live Update section (this was introduced after server version 5.9.0.0, so it won't show up for you on the current server version).
