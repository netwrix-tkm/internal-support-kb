After the client upgrade job finishes, please follow these steps for the server and client upgrade:
1.    Since your server version is 5.7.1.0, you should first upgrade to version 5.9.1.0 – this is done incrementally, so first the server will get upgraded to 5.8.0.0, then to 5.9.0.0 and then to 5.9.1.0
This can be done from Dashboard -> Live Update -> Click on Check Now -> Select the Update -> Hit Apply and when it’s done you will have to refresh the page and check the right bottom corner to confirm the new server version:
 

2.    When the server is upgraded to 5.9.1.0, please start an upgrade job for the clients as well from System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade -> Select the latest version -> Click Next -> Select the Macs and click Next -> Click on Start Upgrade Job:
 

3.    When the clients are upgraded, you can continue with upgrading the server, first to 5.9.2.0 and then to 5.9.3.0
4.    Finally, upgrade the clients again to the latest version from the console.
5.    Schedule a call to confirm if everything is working correctly.
