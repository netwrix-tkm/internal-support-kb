We are Netwrix distributors and partners and we need to know about releases before customers, or at least at the same time. 

Now there is this 5.9.4.1 release that we were not aware of and now we asked sales team and they mentioned we must advise customers not to install it. What is wrong with 5.9.4.1? 

What if a customer installs it ? How should we proceed? 

How can we know about releases earlier? How can we know about its issues/bugs and bug fixes?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-18T17:08:58.000Z"

There was an issue discovered in 5.9.4.1 which would not allow customers to login to the EPP UI through SSO login. The issue was already resolved and the 5.9.4.1 patch is updated, so from now on, customers can apply 5.9.4.1 and they shouldn't have any issue.

Customers that already applied it will receive soon a notification by email and they will be asked to contact support if they are facing issues with the SSO login.

Regarding the possibility if learning about new releases before customers do, unfortunately it is not something we can do from Support. Please contact your Channel Account Manager about this.

- Awaiting response from client","","","","005Qk000002lX5pIAE","2025-01-09T22:39:35.000Z"
