"500Qk00000DWyJJIA1","00416056","Support Ticket","Server Update process stacked","Hello,

Customer name is PrivatBank.
We continue to set up a new test EPP server.
Recently, we've transferred all setting from the main EPP server to the test server,  including CAP policies etc.
Then we tried to update the EPP server to the latest 5.9.3.0 version in Live Update and the update process started but stacked at 37.5% and does not complete.
We waited for almost a day, but the situation did not change.
Could you please take a look at this update job?
Also, can we try to upload an offline patch in case if the previous update did not finish yet?
Or it may cause some issues?","","","","The customer's network team opened access to 178.63.3.86:443 which is the IP Address of liveupdate.endpointprotector.com.  After access to our domain was granted the customer was bale to apply the live update patch.
Customer confirmed that update applied successfully. The version now is 5.9.4.0.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Upgrade","NONE","","12.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-07-25T08:21:51.000Z","2024-08-06T07:53:36.000Z"
