Hi Eduard,
I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites

It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.

Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.

Thanks,
Jeff

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry.

Hi Eduard,
I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?

Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Eduard,
I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>

It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.

Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref


Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?

 

Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.

Hi Eduard,
I'm in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I'm available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 - 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

7/10 - 3-4pm
7/11 - 1-4pm
7/12 - 1-4pm

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

Thanks,

Hi Eduard,
I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>

It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.

Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

 

7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm

 

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Hi Eduard, 



I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected? 



  



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this? 



  



Thanks, 



Jeff

Hi Eduard, 



Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

I forgot to mention that my IP is dynamic and might change until then if I have a power surge.
SSH access can be done via remote control from your computer if that works for you.
If not, I can provide you with an IP during the session.

Hi Eduard,
I'm in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I'm available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 - 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

7/10 - 3-4pm
7/11 - 1-4pm
7/12 - 1-4pm

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

Thanks,
Jeff

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref


Hi Eduard,
I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?

Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Eduard,
Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.

Thank you,
Jeff

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vb2ZmbGluZV9wYXRjaGVzL0VQUDUwMDU3NTY1MC50YXIuZ3o=&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=T0l0QnFLY1hqb2lBYzBKR2c1SWhoYTAzeEl4VTExL1Y5Y3pxcGZaQWxUVT0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
[cid:image004.png@01DAD20A.2821CA60]In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.
[cid:image005.png@01DAD20A.2821CA60]
After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.
[cid:image006.png@01DAD20A.2821CA60]
Please let me know the outcome.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref

Hi Eduard,
I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>

It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.

Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:



7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm



If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?



Thanks,

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vb2ZmbGluZV9wYXRjaGVzL0VQUDUwMDU3NTY1MC50YXIuZ3o=&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=T0l0QnFLY1hqb2lBYzBKR2c1SWhoYTAzeEl4VTExL1Y5Y3pxcGZaQWxUVT0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
[cid:48478097-f61a-4fe8-aa84-ae1b9b6994c9@Image_6_]In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.
[cid:a1927597-145d-4e91-8044-5cd522fcef4b@Image_7_]
After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.
[cid:9c8f4f33-d1d7-415c-b7be-b90a16130366@Image_8_]
Please let me know the outcome.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref


Hi Eduard,

I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, 



I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document:  https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites 



  



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know. 



  



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago. 



  



Thanks, 



Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

 

7/10 - 3-4pm

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

 

Thanks,

Hi Eduard, 



I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected? 



  



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this? 



  



Thanks, 



Jeff

Hi Eduard, 



Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.

After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref



Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.



Thank you,

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vb2ZmbGluZV9wYXRjaGVzL0VQUDUwMDU3NTY1MC50YXIuZ3o=&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=T0l0QnFLY1hqb2lBYzBKR2c1SWhoYTAzeEl4VTExL1Y5Y3pxcGZaQWxUVT0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
[cid:55680e8d-0f59-4453-8a91-64b8b2716789@Image_9_]In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.
[cid:c731c07c-f582-42c3-aadf-fe6f2f7c80f9@Image_10_]
After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.
[cid:82cd35cc-315e-4d49-b7be-ee04859f869a@Image_11_]
Please let me know the outcome.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard,
I've created a new instance and did the following:


  *
I took a backup of the existing server using the System Backup v2 and downloaded that along with the required key.
  *
I activated the trial license so I could download all of the latest updates.
  *
I restored the backup. I can see all of the computers and it seems like the license also transferred.

I've flipped the elastic IP over to the new server and computers are showing as online, so I presume all is good. The only thing I noticed was that the disk space was still 100GB. I had set the disk to be 300GB when I created the EC2 instance, but it seems like it doesn't take the extra space unfortunately. Is it possible for you to share the SSH password with me? I know the screen sharing was a bit finnicky at times yesterday, and I'm familiar with how to resize partitions. I'm fine to take a stab at it myself.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:



7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm



If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref



Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.



Thank you,

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vb2ZmbGluZV9wYXRjaGVzL0VQUDUwMDU3NTY1MC50YXIuZ3o=&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=T0l0QnFLY1hqb2lBYzBKR2c1SWhoYTAzeEl4VTExL1Y5Y3pxcGZaQWxUVT0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
[cid:55680e8d-0f59-4453-8a91-64b8b2716789@Image_9_]In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.
[cid:c731c07c-f582-42c3-aadf-fe6f2f7c80f9@Image_10_]
After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.
[cid:82cd35cc-315e-4d49-b7be-ee04859f869a@Image_11_]
Please let me know the outcome.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard,

I've created a new instance and did the following:

 


	
	I took a backup of the existing server using the System Backup v2 and downloaded that along with the required key.
	
	
	I activated the trial license so I could download all of the latest updates.
	
	
	I restored the backup. I can see all of the computers and it seems like the license also transferred.
	


I've flipped the elastic IP over to the new server and computers are showing as online, so I presume all is good. The only thing I noticed was that the disk space was still 100GB. I had set the disk to be 300GB when I created the EC2 instance, but it seems like it doesn't take the extra space unfortunately. Is it possible for you to share the SSH password with me? I know the screen sharing was a bit finnicky at times yesterday, and I'm familiar with how to resize partitions. I'm fine to take a stab at it myself.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

 

7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm

 

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, 



I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected? 



  



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this? 



  



Thanks, 



Jeff

Hi Eduard, 



Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps. 



  



Thank you,

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.

After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Please let me know the outcome.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref
 



Hi Eduard, 



I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document:  https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites 



  



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know. 



  



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago. 



  



Thanks, 



Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,
Alright, I understand. I have availability tomorrow between 1-2pm and 3-4pm. I did launch the instance with an SSH key (honestly speaking it was in hopes I could use that to access it without the password 🙂 ). If you need that I can provide it during the session.

If the above times don't work we can sync up next week.

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Unfortunately, that is not possible. To have SSH access credentials we have a legal process to go through, but we can set another remote session. I will also check with DevOps to see if I missed anything.
Just let me know your availability.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref

Hi Eduard,
I've created a new instance and did the following:


  *
I took a backup of the existing server using the System Backup v2 and downloaded that along with the required key.
  *
I activated the trial license so I could download all of the latest updates.
  *
I restored the backup. I can see all of the computers and it seems like the license also transferred.

I've flipped the elastic IP over to the new server and computers are showing as online, so I presume all is good. The only thing I noticed was that the disk space was still 100GB. I had set the disk to be 300GB when I created the EC2 instance, but it seems like it doesn't take the extra space unfortunately. Is it possible for you to share the SSH password with me? I know the screen sharing was a bit finnicky at times yesterday, and I'm familiar with how to resize partitions. I'm fine to take a stab at it myself.

Thanks,
Jeff

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:



7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm



If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Cntu5:ref



Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?



Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.



Thank you,

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link: EPP500575650.tar.gz<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vb2ZmbGluZV9wYXRjaGVzL0VQUDUwMDU3NTY1MC50YXIuZ3o=&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=T0l0QnFLY1hqb2lBYzBKR2c1SWhoYTAzeEl4VTExL1Y5Y3pxcGZaQWxUVT0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
[cid:281afeed-d52d-45f4-8b6f-14faeda95c0c@Image_15_]In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.
[cid:f1d832fe-0e34-42f9-a565-3344ee1b9c38@Image_16_]
After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.
[cid:e38e4e14-03d3-4934-8e1a-dc9cf853239d@Image_17_]
Please let me know the outcome.

Hi Eduard,

I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL3N1cHBvcnQvZW5kcG9pbnQtcHJvdGVjdG9yL2VuZHBvaW50LXByb3RlY3Rvci01LjcuMC4wLXVwZ3JhZGUtcHJlcmVxdWlzaXRlcw==&i=NjAyZmQ1OTBhNWY2OWEyOTQxMjAzYjU4&t=VkJYaUdLZ0lWUEFZYW55UnJZKzVTZFpqWXJnN1lIMHpwRXYzVWxpZ3N6MD0=&h=8b242295d8c3441bb2115efd1781ba3f&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>



It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.



Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.



Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard,

Alright, I understand. I have availability tomorrow between 1-2pm and 3-4pm. I did launch the instance with an SSH key (honestly speaking it was in hopes I could use that to access it without the password 🙂 ). If you need that I can provide it during the session.

 

If the above times don't work we can sync up next week.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Unfortunately, that is not possible. To have SSH access credentials we have a legal process to go through, but we can set another remote session. I will also check with DevOps to see if I missed anything.
Just let me know your availability.

Hi Eduard,

I've created a new instance and did the following:

 


	
	I took a backup of the existing server using the System Backup v2 and downloaded that along with the required key.
	
	
	I activated the trial license so I could download all of the latest updates.
	
	
	I restored the backup. I can see all of the computers and it seems like the license also transferred.
	


I've flipped the elastic IP over to the new server and computers are showing as online, so I presume all is good. The only thing I noticed was that the disk space was still 100GB. I had set the disk to be 300GB when I created the EC2 instance, but it seems like it doesn't take the extra space unfortunately. Is it possible for you to share the SSH password with me? I know the screen sharing was a bit finnicky at times yesterday, and I'm familiar with how to resize partitions. I'm fine to take a stab at it myself.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

I’m in the US Eastern (NY) timezone. I’m available for the next ~3 hours (12:30 – 3:30pm). Here is my availability for the next few days as well:

 

7/10 - 3-4pm

7/11 – 1-4pm

7/12 – 1-4pm

 

If you could let me know what IP you will be coming from that would be appreciated, I will need to add it to the security group that this EC2 instance is using.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeff,

To increase the partition, I need SSH access. I have the credentials and I can help you with that.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for today and the next few days, and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

I was able to apply updates sequentially to get us to 5.9.3.0. I have applied the HWA-EPP4-U8800 version 1.1 update as well, however after applying this update I still see this update as available in the list after re-checking for updates. Is this expected?

 

Lastly, an unrelated question. Is it possible to increase the disk space that the EPP server has to work with? I had increased the AWS EBS volume size, however I know that for that to do anything the underlying operating system partitions need to be expanded. I assume I'd need SSH access to do this. As stated in my prior email, I don't recall us setting an SSH password upon initial installation of the EPP server. Any ideas on how to proceed with this?

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Eduard,

Thank you very much. I will apply the patch. I'm in the process of taking a backup of the instance now in case something goes awry. I will likely run this update tomorrow since the backup will take a bit of time. I'll update you with how that goes tomorrow. Thank you for sending the patch and the steps.

 

Thank you,

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

If you did not upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0 then indeed we do not need a remote session. You just need to apply the offline patch following the guide:

To apply the offline patch 5.6.5.0 that enables partitions, please download the patch from this link:  EPP500575650.tar.gz
The next step is to log into the Web console, and go to Dashboard -> Live Update and click on Offline Patch Uploader
In the next screen, browse to the downloaded patch then press Upload Patch. Please only press it once as the second press will have an empty field for the selected file. Once the ""Patch applied successfully"" notification appears press Back.

After the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Please let me know the outcome.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard,

I haven't even quite gotten that far yet. I was just reading the upgrade documentation in preparation for what would need to be done and came across this document:  https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/endpoint-protector-5.7.0.0-upgrade-prerequisites

 

It doesn't mention any need for a remote SSH session, just that an offline patch would be required and to request it from support. It's not clear to me how to upgrade from 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0. I presumed once this offline patch was installed that the live update would show 5.7.0.0 as an upgrade option (and that I'd need to continually follow the live updater to get to the latest 5.9 version), but if I'm mistaken or there is an easier way to go about this please let me know.

 

Lastly, SSH is enabled, however I do not know the password. I don't recall us setting up a password for SSH access when the AMI was initially launched a number of years ago.

 

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi Jeffery,

From the description, I assume you received an error stating that partitions are not activated and to contact support.
To use the offline patch to create the partitions, we must first remove the error from the server, and only then we can apply another patch.
We will need to set up a remote session and will need SSH access to the AWS instance. In AWS the port for SSH is 62828, so please make sure we have the SSH enabled by the time we have the remote session.
Also, my recommendation is to have a snapshot in AWS created before any upgrade, as a precaution.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
