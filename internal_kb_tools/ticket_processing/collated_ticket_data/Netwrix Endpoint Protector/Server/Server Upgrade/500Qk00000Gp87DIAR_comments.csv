If you've already completed these steps and aren't seeing any updates, it's likely that the GPG error was resolved correctly.

The fact that you ran sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade without receiving any updates indicates that your system is fully up-to-date and there are no new updates available in the customer's repositories.
