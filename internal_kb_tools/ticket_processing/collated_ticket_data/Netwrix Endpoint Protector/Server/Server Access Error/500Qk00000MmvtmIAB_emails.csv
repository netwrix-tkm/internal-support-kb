After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Shashank and Naveen,

I hope both of you are doing well.

Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.

Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change.


Thank you!

Alexandra Bolfa

Customer Success Manager, AmplifySuccess Team

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Shashank and Naveen,

I hope both of you are doing well.

Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.

Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change.


Thank you!

Alexandra Bolfa

Customer Success Manager, AmplifySuccess Team

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Shashank and Naveen, 



 



I hope both of you are doing well. 



 



Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.



 



Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change. 



 



 



Thank you! 



Alexandra Bolfa

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.

[cid:image001.png@01DBA8A2.47DA0380]

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

Thanks!

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.




 

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap. For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.""

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?



Kind regards

Acknowledged.

Thanks!

Hi Shashank and Naveen, 



 



I hope both of you are doing well. 



 



Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.



 



Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change. 



 



 



Thank you! 



Alexandra Bolfa

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Shashank and Naveen, 



 



I hope both of you are doing well. 



 



Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.



 



Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change. 



 



 



Thank you! 



Alexandra Bolfa

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.

[cid:image001.png@01DBA8AB.6CABE440]

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

Thanks!

Hi Shashank and Naveen,

I hope both of you are doing well.

Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.

Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change.


Thank you!

Alexandra Bolfa

Customer Success Manager, AmplifySuccess Team

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hi Andre,

Yes, I can access it now.

Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.

 

Thanks!

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.




 

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Yes, I can access it now.

Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.

[cid:image005.png@01DBA934.1F393D00]

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap. For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.""

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?



Kind regards

Hi Shashank and Naveen,

I hope both of you are doing well.

Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.

Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change.


Thank you!

Alexandra Bolfa

Hi Andre,

Yes, I can access it now.

Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.




 

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap. For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.""

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?



Kind regards

Hi Shashank and Naveen, 



 



I hope both of you are doing well. 



 



Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.



 



Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change. 



 



 



Thank you!

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
As this is a server hosted by us, I would need to request approval from the DevOPS team in order to further investigate this.
I will get back to you once I have any new informations.

""Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.""

We would like to inform you that we are aiming to implement a feature that would send alerts and transform them into SalesForce tickets so that the Netwrix Support Engineers give a reply and proceed with required steps based on priority but this requires integration between different department tools and it might take a while but we would be happy to inform you once this would be available.

With your permission, we would proceed to closing this ticket now as solved.

Hi Andre,

Please note that I have responded and am currently awaiting confirmation. Check the image below. Not sure why it was not conveyed internally within your team.




 

However, since the server is inaccessible for a long time and the instance type modification will not incur additional costs, please proceed with the activity immediately.

Once done, please let us know!

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

I trust all is well with you.

I would like to follow up on this ticket as we have not yet received a response from you regarding the recommendation from our DevOps to increase instance type.

""The  instance type modification from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap. For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.""

Could you please let us know if we can proceed with this action?



Kind regards

Hi  @Shashank Sinha,

Acknowledged.

We will complete the task within this week. Additionally, could you please confirm whether a separate support ticket is necessary, or if we can proceed with this existing ticket? We would prefer to utilize this same ticket for easier tracking

 

Thanks!

Hi Shashank and Naveen, 



 



I hope both of you are doing well. 



 



Following the email sent by our Support Team in regard to the modification of your instance type, I would like to inform you that normally this change requires an additional cost, as this involves resources adjustments, which also incurs extra expenses on our end. However, as a gesture of goodwill, we received approval from Netwrix management team to make a one-time exception for you and we will provide this modification at no additional charge.



 



Please continue to work with our Support Team in order to proceed with this change. 



 



 



Thank you!

Dear Naveen,

After analyzing this case with our DevOps department we would like to increase the instance type for your.
The  instance type modification from  c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM)  to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

For this we would require your written confirmation as well as letting us know when would it be suitable for you to do this as it will require a 15 minutes downtime for the server.
