I'm sure you can easily go through this seeing how creatively you fixed it.
If it happens again this is what we do:

rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70* 
vim /etc/default/grub 
     In GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, along with the other options, add this before the last character (""): net.ifnames=0 
Save and quit: :wq 

update-grub 
Reboot the appliance and check the network interface naming again. If the interfaces still have the wrong name, check the steps and perform them again.

Let me know if anything seems off or needs more explaining.

Thank you,
