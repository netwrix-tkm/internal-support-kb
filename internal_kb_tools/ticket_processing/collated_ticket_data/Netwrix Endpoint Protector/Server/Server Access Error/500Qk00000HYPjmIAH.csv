"500Qk00000HYPjmIAH","00425219","Support Ticket","network packets from client to server being dropped","Hi there,

We noticed last week that we couldn't access the EPP server for management from our clients but it worked fine from servers on-premise. After a bit of investigation we noticed that the issue is possibly related to our zero trust solution, called zscaler. We have a client running on all clients which sends all traffic to on-premise resources through  2 onprem servers (whether a user is onprem or working remotely), so the EPP server sees it as all connections are coming from 2 IPs and potentially blocking some of them or dropping some.
While it was unavailable from a client it worked just fine from an adjacent onprem server.
I suspect it's part of a DDOS protection setting or something along those lines.
Would it be possible to raise the threshold or exempt the IPS of the appliances.
Kind regards

Dezso","","Our customer 'Senedd' reported that they are experiencing packet losses between the epp clients and the EPP server.
The EPP clients are sending their traffic to the EPP Server via zScaller servers over the cloud and over LAN via zscaller servers., depending if the endpoints are onsite or remote.

The EPP Server only receives the TCP traffic via the two zscaller Server IP Addresses. They are reporting that the issue only occurs when the TCP traffic load is high, as the EPP Server responds to the EPP clients via the zscaller Server IP address the packets are dropped and not delivered to the EPP clients / endpoint machines.

They submitted the epp client logs taken from one of the affected endpoint machines while the issue was occurring.

The customer only has Device Control license, so Deep Packet Inspection with ""Stealthy DPI Driver"" will not be an option to enable.","","Feedback from customer:

""Thanks for sharing the advisory, I’m happy to leave it as is as it sits in an isolated environment.
I’m happy for the ticket to be resolved.""","","Andre Le Roux","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","NONE","","101.1","Closed - Resolved","Senedd","Dezso Fater","2024-10-28T11:48:42.000Z","2025-02-06T13:35:27.000Z"
