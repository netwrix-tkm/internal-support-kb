"500Qk00000ICEjFIAX","00426764","Support Ticket","Problem with access to linux server","Hi, 

we have problem with accessing linux server with root credentials. Since the credentials were wrong, now we are blocked to access the server at all. Can you help us with resetting credentials and unblocking access to this server? We need to access it to check if ports 513 and 514 are allowed so we can integrate SIEM application with it. We need help with this part, too. 

Thanks in advance.","","","","We restarted the server and then the logs were entering the SIEM server.
