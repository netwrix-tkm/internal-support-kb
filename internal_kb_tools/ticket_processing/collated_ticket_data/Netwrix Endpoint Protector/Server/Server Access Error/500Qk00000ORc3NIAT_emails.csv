Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting, we disabled the Two Factor Authenticator (Use Google Authentication) to allow you the access to log in the EPP interface.

After that, we checked in the EPP console, Appliance -> Server Maintenance the Current time server and we noticed that it should be synchronized.

It remains that you add the appropriated NTP Server and then to test again with the Two Factor Authenticator.

Let us know how it works.

Hello,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting, we disabled the Two Factor Authenticator (Use Google Authentication) to allow you the access to log in the EPP interface.

After that, we checked in the EPP console, Appliance -> Server Maintenance the Current time server and we noticed that it should be synchronized.

It remains that you add the appropriated NTP Server and then to test again with the Two Factor Authenticator.

Let us know how it works.
