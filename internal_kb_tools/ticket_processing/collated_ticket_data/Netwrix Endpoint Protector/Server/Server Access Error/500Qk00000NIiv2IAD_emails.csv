Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

To recap what we did today:
We accessed the backend of your EPP appliance to remove old backup logs, shadows and upgrade patch backups which were piled up on your disk partition.

Now that the  partition was cleared of those unnecessary backups, only 10% of it is occupied and as you saw, you could access the portal without a problem.

In case you face other difficulties please us know.

Have a great day!
