Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- optimized the EPP server resources to the current resources allocated. Previously extremely high resources were configured and this caused the slow UI response times.
- we also rebooted the EPP server as it was online for 175 days
- we updated the AD Admin Authentication with the correct LDAP
- we also disabled the ""Ignore AD Authentication"" option for all admins

These changes resolved the 2 issues the customer experienced.

We are closing this ticket.
