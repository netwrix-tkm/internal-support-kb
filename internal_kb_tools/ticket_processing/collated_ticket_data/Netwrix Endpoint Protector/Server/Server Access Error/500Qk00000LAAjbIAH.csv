Here are the info: 
This morning around 10:00 AM, we added a new license key valid for the next three years. Until now, the system had been functioning normally, except for issues with updates.
Last year, shortly after the company was acquired by Netwrix, two updates were released. The first one installed successfully, but the second one failed. After several unsuccessful installation attempts and failing to open a ticket in your system, we gave up and left the issue unresolved.
Today, we made another attempt to install this update, but it failed again with the following error message:
Update goes to 62.5% it says - An error occurred. Hash does not match.
Some problems occurred during installation. Please Contact Support.
(ERROR: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update...)
The update in question is Netwrix Endpoint Protector 5.9.4.1 (HWA-EPP4-U0066).
We managed to create an account in your system and began gathering the necessary data to open a new ticket. Shortly after, the system completely stopped functioning. The web interface is entirely unresponsive and cannot be accessed via either IP address or domain name.
We attempted to restart the system multiple times, but the issue persists.
