Hi André,

It was enabled for a couple of computers and we experienced the issue yesterday. We tried collecting logs, but for example my computer just sits at ""Please wait collecting logs"", however one of my coworker had it working and they got uploaded (attached)

Hi André,

I asked one of my colleagues who's in the team that manages policies/etc (I'm from the infrastructure team so I'm not really working in the product) to deploy it to clients and we'll be collecting some logs Tuesday/Wednesday since those are the busiest day.

Hi Dezso,

Thank you for the details and the diagram displaying the flow of TCP traffic via Zscaller Servers and the EPP Server.  I will open a case internally with our Dev team and request for their input.
As you mentioned on our call that you are not able to reproduce this issue on demand and it most likely will occur next week when there is a higher load of TCP traffic, can I ask that you enable debug logging on a few endpoint machines please?
When we have log files to review it would give us more insight of what happens when there are a loss of TCP packets.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoints while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hi Adrian,

sorry for the delay.
I attached an image that shows the way our clients communicate with servers.
Whether a client is on site or remote it connects via the onpremise zscaler servers, so their source IP for the recipient server will show up as the LAN address of the zscaler servers.  Only servers can do a connection between other servers using their own IP locally.
The green lines are showing working connections: clients via zscaler could access any server resources (except EPP) , servers could also access EPP at the same time.
The red lines are showing where we had a lot of dropped connections: a lot of clients via zscaler neither on-premise nor remote couldn't connect and the logs on the zscaler server show a lot of timeout. Obesrving the EPP server while connected from an other server (not via zscaler) the connection was instantaneous and no lost packet was observed at the same time.

Kind regards,

Hi André,

I'm free tomorrow 8:30-15:30 UTC, but later the week my calendar is awfully full. If you don't have any availability, I'd suggest next week.(screenshot attached)
I can't guarantee that we can see the same behaviour, but I should be able to show you what is probably causing the issues.

Hi Dezso,

Can we have a call to discuss the issue in depth and also if you could demonstrate the issue on call please?  This would be very helpful for us to get a clear understanding of what exactly happens and how two IP address are detected.

Can we have a remote session tomorrow or in the week? please propose three time slots.

When we have log files to review it would give us more insight of what happens when there are a loss of TCP packets.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoints while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hi Adrian,

sorry for the delay.
I attached an image that shows the way our clients communicate with servers.
Whether a client is on site or remote it connects via the onpremise zscaler servers, so their source IP for the recipient server will show up as the LAN address of the zscaler servers.  Only servers can do a connection between other servers using their own IP locally.
The green lines are showing working connections: clients via zscaler could access any server resources (except EPP) , servers could also access EPP at the same time.
The red lines are showing where we had a lot of dropped connections: a lot of clients via zscaler neither on-premise nor remote couldn’t connect and the logs on the zscaler server show a lot of timeout. Obesrving the EPP server while connected from an other server (not via zscaler) the connection was instantaneous and no lost packet was observed at the same time.
 

Kind regards,

Hi Dezso,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As discussed in our call, please do provide us with a diagram which shows the flow of TCP traffic between the EPP Clients and EPP Server and I will open a case internally with our Dev team and ask for their advice / input on the matter.

Hi André,

I’m free tomorrow 8:30-15:30 UTC, but later the week my calendar is awfully full. If you don’t have any availability, I’d suggest next week.(screenshot attached)
I can’t guarantee that we can see the same behaviour, but I should be able to show you what is probably causing the issues.

 

Kind regards,

Hi Dezso,

Can we have a call to discuss the issue in depth and also if you could demonstrate the issue on call please?  This would be very helpful for us to get a clear understanding of what exactly happens and how two IP address are detected.

Can we have a remote session tomorrow or in the week? please propose three time slots.



Kind regards

just an FYI, I'll be on annual leave the next week and there's no rush on this ticket due to having minimal to no impact now.

Hi André,

It was enabled for a couple of computers and we experienced the issue yesterday. We tried collecting logs, but for example my computer just sits at ""Please wait collecting logs"", however one of my coworker had it working and they got uploaded (attached)

Hi André,

I asked one of my colleagues who's in the team that manages policies/etc (I'm from the infrastructure team so I'm not really working in the product) to deploy it to clients and we'll be collecting some logs Tuesday/Wednesday since those are the busiest day.

Hi Dezso,

Thank you for the details and the diagram displaying the flow of TCP traffic via Zscaller Servers and the EPP Server.  I will open a case internally with our Dev team and request for their input.

Hi Dezso,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  As discussed in our call, please do provide us with a diagram which shows the flow of TCP traffic between the EPP Clients and EPP Server and I will open a case internally with our Dev team and ask for their advice / input on the matter.

Hi André,

I'm free tomorrow 8:30-15:30 UTC, but later the week my calendar is awfully full. If you don't have any availability, I'd suggest next week.(screenshot attached)
I can't guarantee that we can see the same behaviour, but I should be able to show you what is probably causing the issues.

Hi Dezso,

Can we have a call to discuss the issue in depth and also if you could demonstrate the issue on call please?  This would be very helpful for us to get a clear understanding of what exactly happens and how two IP address are detected.

Can we have a remote session tomorrow or in the week? please propose three time slots.

Hi André,

It was enabled for a couple of computers and we experienced the issue yesterday. We tried collecting logs, but for example my computer just sits at “Please wait collecting logs”, however one of my coworker had it working and they got uploaded (attached)

Hi André,

I asked one of my colleagues who’s in the team that manages policies/etc (I’m from the infrastructure team so I’m not really working in the product) to deploy it to clients and we’ll be collecting some logs Tuesday/Wednesday since those are the busiest day.

Hi Dezso,

Thank you for the details and the diagram displaying the flow of TCP traffic via Zscaller Servers and the EPP Server.  I will open a case internally with our Dev team and request for their input.
As you mentioned on our call that you are not able to reproduce this issue on demand and it most likely will occur next week when there is a higher load of TCP traffic, can I ask that you enable debug logging on a few endpoint machines please?
When we have log files to review it would give us more insight of what happens when there are a loss of TCP packets.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoints while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hi Adrian,

sorry for the delay.
I attached an image that shows the way our clients communicate with servers.
Whether a client is on site or remote it connects via the onpremise zscaler servers, so their source IP for the recipient server will show up as the LAN address of the zscaler servers.  Only servers can do a connection between other servers using their own IP locally.
The green lines are showing working connections: clients via zscaler could access any server resources (except EPP) , servers could also access EPP at the same time.
The red lines are showing where we had a lot of dropped connections: a lot of clients via zscaler neither on-premise nor remote couldn’t connect and the logs on the zscaler server show a lot of timeout. Obesrving the EPP server while connected from an other server (not via zscaler) the connection was instantaneous and no lost packet was observed at the same time.
 

Kind regards,

			Senedd Cymru yw’r corff sy’n cael ei ethol yn ddemocrataidd i gynrychioli buddiannau Cymru a’i phobl. Mae’r Senedd, fel y’i gelwir, yn deddfu ar gyfer Cymru, yn cytuno ar drethi yng Nghymru, ac yn dwyn Llywodraeth Cymru i gyfrif.

			The Welsh Parliament is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people. Commonly known as the Senedd, it makes laws for Wales, agrees Welsh taxes and holds the Welsh Government to account.

Hi Dezso,

Can we have a call to discuss the issue in depth and also if you could demonstrate the issue on call please?  This would be very helpful for us to get a clear understanding of what exactly happens and how two IP address are detected.

Can we have a remote session tomorrow or in the week? please propose three time slots.



Kind regards
