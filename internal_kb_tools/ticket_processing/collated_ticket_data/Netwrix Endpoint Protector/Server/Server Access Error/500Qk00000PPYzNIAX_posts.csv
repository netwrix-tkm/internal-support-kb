We have call them and organise a remote session .

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
tried to access the backend of the server through the EPP VM console
we have restarted the machine and the issue persisted
tried to access the GRUB menu and each time we select to access the console or the boot option the page was returning to the first page
we have shut down the old machine and create a new one
on the new machine we have used the same IP as the previous one
added the ssl certificate and we were able to access the EPP UI with both option (IP and FQDN) 
next step was to upload the license
we update the EPP server to the latest version 5.9.4.1
As we agreed this case will be closed since the issue has been fixed.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-05-21T13:58:28.000Z"
