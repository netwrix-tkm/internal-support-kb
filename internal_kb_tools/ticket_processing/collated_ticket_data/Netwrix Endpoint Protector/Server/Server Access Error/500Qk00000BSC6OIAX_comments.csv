@Emil-Ionut PodarÂ according to the logs, indeed, there is a certificate issue. Sometimes the client manages to get the certificate from the server but soon after it gets a 401 error when it tries to communicate with the server using that certificate. In other cases it does not even get the certificate apparently. Please discuss this with your colleagues in the support team. This issue is usually related to the customer's environment/setup, maybe a Load Balancer? If you don't figure it out, next step would be to contact the DevOps team (or Server team?).
