We had a remote session with the customer and it was about 2FA, not OPT.
We disabled the 2FA from the database (update sf_guard_user set use_google_authentication=0 where id=...;) and then in the EPP console, we saw that the Current time server is not synchronized.
The customer needs to add the appropriated  NTP server and then to test again with the 2FA.","","","","005Qk0000046vhFIAQ","2025-04-28T13:34:57.000Z"
