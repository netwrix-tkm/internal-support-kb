Customer is unable to login to the server, they are being directed to an error page, incorrect creds or login error. 
In some browsers, we are able to resolve this issue by clearing cookies/site data. But same issue occurs again after some time. 

I am attaching the screenshot of the error : Incorrect credentials. 

Note: here, customer is entering the correct credentials and still receiving this error. 

Please assist.

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","Case resolved in remote session.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","NONE","","71.4","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2024-08-06T05:11:57.000Z","2024-10-16T15:44:21.000Z"
