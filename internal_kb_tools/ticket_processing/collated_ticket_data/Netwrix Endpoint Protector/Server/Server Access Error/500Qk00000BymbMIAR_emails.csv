Hi,

We don't have anything in our deny list, we only use an allow list. Which I have checked upon your recommendation.

Sorry, no, I never got that message btw.

Can we setup a call to investigate why traffic from 130.41.177.252/32 isnt allowed by the appliance?

Hi,

 

We don’t have anything in our deny list, we only use an allow list. Which I have checked upon your recommendation.

 

Sorry, no, I never got that message btw.

 

Can we setup a call to investigate why traffic from 130.41.177.252/32 isnt allowed by the appliance?

 

Regards,

John

Hi John,

I replied two days ago. I'm not sure if you received my email :

""It happens on both Mac and Windows. It looks to us that one of our gateway addresses is blacklisted. As when we bypass the offending address your appliance allows us to connect.""
Please check if the gateway address was possibly included in an EPP denylist.
In the past there was a similar situation where localhost 127.0.0.1 was blacklisted by mistake.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hey,

I don't think we need a call. Can you check that your appliance hasn't blacklisted the address I have sent?

We can use other outgoing addresses and they go through fine.

For now, we are bypassing that address by not tunnelling the epp client through the vpn.

Hi John,

I replied two days ago. I'm not sure if you received my email :

""It happens on both Mac and Windows. It looks to us that one of our gateway addresses is blacklisted. As when we bypass the offending address your appliance allows us to connect.""
Please check if the gateway address was possibly included in an EPP denylist.
In the past there was a similar situation where localhost 127.0.0.1 was blacklisted by mistake.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi John,

I replied two days ago. I'm not sure if you received my email :

""It happens on both Mac and Windows. It looks to us that one of our gateway addresses is blacklisted. As when we bypass the offending address your appliance allows us to connect.""
Please check if the gateway address was possibly included in an EPP denylist.
In the past there was a similar situation where localhost  127.0.0.1 was blacklisted by mistake.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi John,

That address is not blocked on our side.
But there is a TCP connection limit per IP per second. I have increased that limit for your server and I believe this will help you.
Let us know if it resolves the issue.

Hi John,

Can you please check if there is any 'Domain and URL' denylist for that particular address ? (from Denylists and Allowlists - Denylists)
Meanwhile, I will check on our side with devops team to make sure those IPs are allowed since the server is hosted by us.

Thank you,

Hey,

 

I don’t think we need a call. Can you check that your appliance hasn’t blacklisted the address I have sent?

 

We can use other outgoing addresses and they go through fine.

 

For now, we are bypassing that address by not tunnelling the epp client through the vpn.

John

Hi,

 

We don’t have anything in our deny list, we only use an allow list. Which I have checked upon your recommendation.

 

Sorry, no, I never got that message btw.

 

Can we setup a call to investigate why traffic from 130.41.177.252/32 isnt allowed by the appliance?

Hi John,

That address is not blocked on our side.
But there is a TCP connection limit per IP per second. I have increased that limit for your server and I believe this will help you.
Let us know if it resolves the issue.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi John,

Can you please check if there is any 'Domain and URL' denylist for that particular address ? (from Denylists and Allowlists - Denylists)
Meanwhile, I will check on our side with devops team to make sure those IPs are allowed since the server is hosted by us.

Thank you,
Alin

Hey,



I don't think we need a call. Can you check that your appliance hasn't blacklisted the address I have sent?



We can use other outgoing addresses and they go through fine.



For now, we are bypassing that address by not tunnelling the epp client through the vpn.

Hi,



We don't have anything in our deny list, we only use an allow list. Which I have checked upon your recommendation.



Sorry, no, I never got that message btw.



Can we setup a call to investigate why traffic from 130.41.177.252/32 isnt allowed by the appliance?

Hi John,

I replied two days ago. I'm not sure if you received my email :

""It happens on both Mac and Windows. It looks to us that one of our gateway addresses is blacklisted. As when we bypass the offending address your appliance allows us to connect.""
Please check if the gateway address was possibly included in an EPP denylist.
In the past there was a similar situation where localhost 127.0.0.1 was blacklisted by mistake.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi John,

Can you please check if there is any 'Domain and URL' denylist for that particular address ? (from Denylists and Allowlists - Denylists)
Meanwhile, I will check on our side with devops team to make sure those IPs are allowed since the server is hosted by us.

Thank you,
Alin

Hey,



I don’t think we need a call. Can you check that your appliance hasn’t blacklisted the address I have sent?



We can use other outgoing addresses and they go through fine.



For now, we are bypassing that address by not tunnelling the epp client through the vpn.



Regards,

John

Hi,



We don’t have anything in our deny list, we only use an allow list. Which I have checked upon your recommendation.



Sorry, no, I never got that message btw.



Can we setup a call to investigate why traffic from 130.41.177.252/32 isnt allowed by the appliance?



Regards,

John

Hi John,

I replied two days ago. I'm not sure if you received my email :

""It happens on both Mac and Windows. It looks to us that one of our gateway addresses is blacklisted. As when we bypass the offending address your appliance allows us to connect.""
Please check if the gateway address was possibly included in an EPP denylist.
In the past there was a similar situation where localhost 127.0.0.1 was blacklisted by mistake.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi John,

Is this happening on Windows OS ?
If so, can you please test white ""Stealthy DPI"" setting is enabled for your machine / user.

Thank you,
