The custom rights cannot be imported on a new appliance.
They could create an Effective Rights report and recreate the rights on the new appliance.

They have a really old server version, 5.2.0.5, and they can't upgrade it, so we can't migrate the rights.
They need the list with the devices from the old server, and since they have several, most with custom rights, they will have to re-create them, hence the need for the list. The list cannot be exported from the UI, as the server version is old, and the export option doesn't exist.
We have spoken to Augustina and she asked us to open this case, because it might be possible to export the list, but it wouldn't be straightforward.
Thanks,

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hi Support team.

There is no option to backport any query to release version 5.2.0.5 (from 14-Feb-2019). Is to old server, and to much risk, which DEV team will not take responsibility.  Please ask customer to follow procedure of EPP server upgrade by migration method. So source server need to be upgraded to version of new server, and use backup v2 procedure to transfer configuration.
