Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.

They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.

We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.

After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.

We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.

We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.

So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.

Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?

Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server. 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.

I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.

What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue. 

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server. 

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.
They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.
We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.
After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.
We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.
We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.
So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.
Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?
Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.
I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.
What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue.

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server.

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.

They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.

We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.

After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.

We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.

We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.

So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.

Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?

Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server. 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.

I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.

What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue. 

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server. 

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.


Best regards,

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.
They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.
We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.
After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.
We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.
We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.
So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.
Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?
Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.
I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.
What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue.

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server.

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.
They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.
We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.
After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.
We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.
We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.
So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.
Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?
Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.
I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.
What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue.

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server.

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

Yes, it's Asia Bank.

The issue is fixed by now. But it took a long time to fix at the moment of renewal. So, the damage is done, unfirtunately.

We are still trying to win this back, but looks unlikely.

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.

They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.

We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.

After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.

We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.

We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.

So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.

Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?

Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.

I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.

What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue.

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server.

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

Yes, it's Asia Bank.

The issue is fixed by now. But it took a long time to fix at the moment of renewal. So, the damage is done, unfirtunately.

We are still trying to win this back, but looks unlikely.

I have no updates on that.

Unfortunately, client stopped using the tool because of the issues experienced and planning a PoC of a competetive product.

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.

They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.

We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.

After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.

We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.

We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.

So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.

Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?

Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.

I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.

What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue.

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server.

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

Yes, it's Asia Bank.

The issue is fixed by now. But it took a long time to fix at the moment of renewal. So, the damage is done, unfirtunately.

We are still trying to win this back, but looks unlikely.

Please monitor the new EPP server for a couple of days and let us know if we can proceed with the closure of this case.

Hello,

We had a remote session with the customer and tried to apply the System Backup v2.
But unfortunately, the backup archive did not apply to the new server for unknown reasons. After import the archive just, nothing happens.
These two servers have tha same version.
We should schedule a remote session, to apply System Backup v2 and migrate the database to the new server.
I hope we could try to apply the System Backup v2 via server backend.

Hello,

We have an update from the customer.

They successfully run the second EPP server, so we can start planning the migration process.

We will have a remote session with them tomorrow and will help them to update their EPP server to the latest version and then migrate settings with Backup V2 option.

After that, we hope that you will help us to migrate the database from the old to the new EPP server.

We can make it in two different sessions or try to make these steps in one session.

Hello,

Thank you for instructions.

We've just received information that customer cannot create a second VM for migrating due to the staff issues.

So, we still need to apply some workaround or fix on the current server.

Did you clarify with the dev team regarding the ""cron"" task for the php-fpm service?

Also, I think we need to schedule another remote session is this case.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Please make sure to perform a snapshot of the Virtual Machine before proceeding with the steps:
1. Download the new VM from the link below.https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email
2. Import them into the environment using this document:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
3. Please activate the trial license on the new server.
4. Please make sure that the EPP server version from the old server is the same with the version from the new server (if not, they need to be updated in order for the migration to be successful)
5. Once both servers have the same version, please go to the old server under ""System Maintenance > System Backup V2"". Here please:- click on ""Create"",- name the backup and add a description.- Click on ""Save"".- Copy the ""System Backup Key"" into a notepad.
- click on ""Yes, I have saved the system backup key"".- Wait for the backup to complete.- download the backup

Please note that the Backup V2 option does not migrate the logs to the new server, and these will still be present on the old server.

Once this steps are finished, we can schedule a remote session for next week to import the system backup into the new server. 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

Customer got the same issue again.

I think we cannot continue to investigate this, and we should move the option with migrating EPP virtualization and apply the database backup.

What steps should we take to make it?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We will open an internal case to our R&D team to request further assistance regarding this issue. 

Before doing this we will need to connect one more time to gather a set of logs and few screenshots from the server. 

Could you please let us know if the customer can connect at 12:00 GMT +2 ?

Regarding the cron task, we will need to raise a Feature Request to our Product Management to be analysed and checked if is affecting any other functionalities. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

 

Customer reported that the issue returns again.

What should be our next step?

As a workaround, could  you please clarify from the dev regarding the cron task for php?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have restarted the php-fpm service which helped us fix the issue and allowed the customer to connect to the EPP UI.

Please monitor this situation for a couple of days and let us know if we can proceed with the closure of this case. 

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,
