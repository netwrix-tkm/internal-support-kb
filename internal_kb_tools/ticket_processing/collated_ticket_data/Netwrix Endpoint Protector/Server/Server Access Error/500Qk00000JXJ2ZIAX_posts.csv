Please note that the server console has not been accessible since this morning. It just keeps reloading after the SSO authentication. Refer to the attached video.

Note: We upgraded the version to 5.9.4.1 on Friday, and it was working fine the same day. However, we suspect this could be the reason.

Consider this a priority and get back to us as soon as possible.

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-16T06:47:57.000Z"
