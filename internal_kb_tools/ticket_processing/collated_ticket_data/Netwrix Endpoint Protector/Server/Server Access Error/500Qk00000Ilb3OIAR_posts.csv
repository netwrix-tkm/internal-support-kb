None of our accounts are able to access the Endpoint Protector admin console.
The message displayed is 'The username or password entered is incorrect'.
Since there is no link to reset our password, could you please do the necessary?
I don't understand why this happened but it may be related to you restarting our server (cf. Ticket 00427922) last week.
Kind regards,
Julien Millet, Astorg","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-25T15:42:09.000Z"
