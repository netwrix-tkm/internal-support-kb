Our customer Genius Consultants Ltd has reported that they are unable to access their cloud endpoint protector server.

URL - <a href='https://b8sond5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/' target='_blank'>https://b8sond5.hosted.endpointprotector.com/</a>","","","","Resolved server access issue after rebooting the server and cleared up space on the server. Advised the customer to send shadow files to external file repository, but the customer did not need the feature enabled and turned it off. I went ahead and cleared out the shadow files and freed up another 28GB.","","Zachary Roy","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","6.4","Closed - Resolved","BD Software Distribution Pvt Ltd","Pravin Bhatuse","2024-12-12T13:06:11.000Z","2024-12-18T22:19:00.000Z"
