"500Qk00000Kb6feIAB","00432026","Support Ticket","Server not working","A cliente named BEMOBI is not being able to access to its console. His instance is <a href='https://lvisf3u.hosted.endpointprotector.com/.' target='_blank'>https://lvisf3u.hosted.endpointprotector.com/.</a>

He is not being able to create the case since he has no access to the console so he can extract the server id.

Thank in advance","","We have performed the server optimization procedure after the DevOps have increased the memory for the hosted server.

The client was informed about this and as part of another related ticket the settings and policies were verified during a remote session to avoid missconfigurations.","We are waiting for the customer's confirmation to close this ticket.","The customer repeatedly encounters server issues due to resource limitations on the hosted server.
