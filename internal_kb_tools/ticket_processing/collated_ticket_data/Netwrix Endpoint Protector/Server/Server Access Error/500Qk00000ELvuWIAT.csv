Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that the EPP console login UI freezes for a minute after entering a wrong password.
Server shows an error ""Unfortunately, the login process encountered an error.  Please try again"" that's why customer should wait a few minutes to try login again.
I've checked in our EPP UI and if we enter a wrong password, the console does not freeze and return only ""The username or password you entered is incorrect."" without any error.
I will attach screenshots a bit later.","","","","Issue resolved by customer","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","17.1","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-08-13T09:35:05.000Z","2024-08-30T11:35:46.000Z"
