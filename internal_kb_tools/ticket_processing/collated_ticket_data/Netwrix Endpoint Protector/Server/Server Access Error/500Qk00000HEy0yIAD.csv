We have an urgent issue. 
We rebooted the endpoint protector server, and upon reboot it has a DHCP address. We tried changing back to the static IP address, but we are getting an error that says invalid gateway. We are positive that this gateway is correct. We cannot ping or access our appliance. 
This is also an air-gapped solution and screenshare is not available.","","","","the customer managed to load the VM in a Linux box and fix the interface issue.","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","20.0","Closed - Resolved","Motorola Solutions Inc","Daniel Harris","2024-10-19T14:44:03.000Z","2024-11-08T15:12:11.000Z"
