We are currently facing an outage with our Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) instance. The last successful check-in from the EPP agent installed on my production machine occurred on 7/9/2024. Our instance is hosted on AWS, and despite attempting a reboot, the issue remains unresolved.

We urgently request your assistance to diagnose and restore our EPP instance to full functionality. 
If any additional information or access is required, please let me know, and I will provide it promptly.


Thank you,

Shaun Khublall
