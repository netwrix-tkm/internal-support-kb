Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have found that the nginx service is not working correctly and we tried to start it. 
If it is possible, can you please check on your end what version of EPP server you were using ? If not we will checking it on Monday. 
The reason of this is that we need to know the version of the server, otherwise there will be no possibility to restore the database.

I have sent you a separate email with the meeting link .

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

As I have no access to the web server and no access to SSH, I will not be able to find the version.  I am pretty sure that there must be a way to find the version number from the logs or system files when we SSH on Monday,

Hello Nigel,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have found that the nginx service is not working correctly and we tried to start it.
If it is possible, can you please check on your end what version of EPP server you were using ? If not we will checking it on Monday.
The reason of this is that we need to know the version of the server, otherwise there will be no possibility to restore the database.

I have sent you a separate email with the meeting link .

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hey Daniel,

Have a look at this article.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62624309/nginx-failed-to-start

Is there any way that we can change the root pw on the old machine so that I can access it over ssh? or create a user for me? If we can figure out how to start the web server then we can take a backup of the server config.

Thanks

Nigel

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your support over the last weeks.  I have managed to get both machines up and running on my DMZ and have them synching with Azure (I think).  I decided to release all the licenses, delete all devices and machines and let them populate a fresh.  The machines are currently populating however, if I choose the device tab, there are no devices found.  Is this something that will repopulate?

Thanks

Nigel

Hi Daniel,

The computers are communicating with the EPP server.  It is just devices local to those machines are not listed.  Maybe we could have a remote session so that I can show you.

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have observed that the issue for what this case has been raised has been fixed. 

To have a clean view and to work on each issue separately, I will open a new case for the devices that are missing from web interface.

Since the issue here is now fixed can we proceed with the closure of this case?

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

I guess you can close this case provideing that there is a new case for the missing Devices.

Just to let you know, I have also implemented SSO with Azure on both machines and got the certificates working.  So the only thing left to do is sort out the missing devices.

Thanks for your help

Nigel
