Hi @Bogdan Melinte, @Cătălin Stoian,

Could you please have a look?

Support team was not able to apply the backend procedure for corrupt database due to the fact that they do not have the backups.

Thank you,
Cristi

@WaitingOnEngineer 

Hi Andre,
(i) You may want to try removing ib_logfile* from /var/eppfiles/mysql dir and afterwards start MySQL
(ii) You may want to try all the options for innodb_force_recovery, from 1 to 6, in case they were not already tried, and if and when MySQL successfully starts, try to run mysqldump on the eppdatabase.
(iii) You may still be able to recover the eppdatabase + /var/www/EPPServer from a backup in /var/eppfiles/backup/patches that should have been made if eventually EPPServer was updated to newer version via LiveUpdate in the past.

If none of these works, they should import a fresh machine to continue their trial.

We had a remote session with the customer today and managed to partially recover the corrupted database.  We ran the mysql service in forced recovery mode ""innodb_force_recovery = 2""
and then the only command which could complete the mysql dump was

""mysqldump -uroot -p --routines --single-transaction=TRUE --ignore-table=eppdatabase.cf_ilog --ignore-table=eppdatabase.cf_log --ignore-table=eppdatabase.log --ignore-table=eppdatabase.ofiletrace eppdatabase > /var/eppfiles/eppmysqldump.sql""

We excluded the following tables from the SQL Dump:
1. ""eppdatabase.cf_ilog""
2. ""table=eppdatabase.cf_log""
3. ""eppdatabase.log""
4. ""eppdatabase.ofiletrace""

*We then made a backup of directory ""/var/eppfiles/mysql"" to ""/var/eppfiles/mysql2""
*We then removed the mysql folder and recreated the MySQL directory.
*We imported the dump back into mysql


After the above steps the customer was able to access the UI again all pages loads except for 
* ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""File Tracing""

These 4 tables still needs to be recreated:
ofiletrace
cf_log
log
cf_ilog

Customer is on 5940 server version.
We could even see logs under Log Reports from today but we tried to overwrite the eppdatabase folder from the backup that we created but  no luck with those 4 tables were missing

Can we please have Dev assistance for table recreation?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-08-23T19:33:41.000Z","2024-08-23T19:33:41.000Z","false","false"
