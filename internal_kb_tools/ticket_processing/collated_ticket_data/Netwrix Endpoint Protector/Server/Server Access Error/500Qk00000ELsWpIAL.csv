Issue 1: 
Our server continues to have sporadic instabilities (3 to 4 in a week). The USB key has been associated with a user for several weeks, months, years. The user can no longer access the device. The Endpoint agent local to the workstation indicates that it is synchronized, but the user does not have access to his USB key (which he may have used some time ago on this same machine). You then need to delete the key/user association in the Endpoint console and recreate it. And it works again.

 
Isssue 2 : 
Next, the request for a resized VM for the second team was not processed. Every time their VM restarts, it takes over 1h30 to boot... ( We tested on a VM downloaded from the Netwrix site, and once the databases were imported, the VM booted in 30s, but the disk size was small compared to the VM that COSOSYS had generated for them at the start of their project.
