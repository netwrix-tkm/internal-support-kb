"500Qk00000IMMKVIA5","00427202","Support Ticket","Webserver Offline","Hi,

I am about to implement Endpoint Protector . I had meeting with Claudia Kurbjuhn we have updated the server everything worked fine. This week  I wanted to download the client package to add it to our software deployment, but for some reasen the Web server is Offline. I have rebooted the Appliance two times but still the Webserver is offline and I cannot connect to webinterface. I can ping the server I can establish a TCP connection to port 22 but port 80 and 443 is closed. 

Please assist.

I cannot provide the IDs and Versions due to the fact the webservice is down and I cannot look it up.

Regards
