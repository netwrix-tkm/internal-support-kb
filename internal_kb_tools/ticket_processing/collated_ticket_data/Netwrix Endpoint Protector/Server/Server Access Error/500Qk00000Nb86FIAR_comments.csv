Hi Andrei,

Every time the DNS is changed, regardless of whether it's done through the UI or the Setup appliance, the netplan configurations are overwritten.

To help identify the root cause, we will also need to review the Nginx configuration (it was mentioned that the Nginx server failed). Additionally, could you please specify if any other steps were taken to resolve the issue?

Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the issue on our side.


Regards,
Augustina
