Hi Daniel,

Please do the following check on the customer server:


	 - 	Check the Nginx configuration so it is not corrupted.
	 - 	check the system logs: (provide screenshots):

	 - 	sudo journalctl -xe
	 - 	sudo dmesg | grep -i ""php-fpm""
	 - 	sudo journalctl -u php-fpm --since ""1 hour ago""

	 - 	re-run the command increasing the time as needed, until PHP errors are displayed (""2 hour ago""  ... ""6 hour ago"")
	 - 	check the PHP configuration to not be broken:

	 - 	





php-fpm -t



Check with the customer to see what happened when the PHP service crashed.
Was the server under heavy load at that time?




Regards,
Augustina

Hi Daniel,

Let's wait after the customer feedback to see if the issue recurs after the configuration changes you made. 

If the PHP service crashes again, please advise the customer not to reboot the server so we can troubleshoot the issue.

Thanks,
Augustina

Hi,

I have looked at the logfile and at the screenshots. It appears that php-fpm segfaults and dies, which is the reason why I believe it becomes inaccessible. Please see: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00436114/Screenshot%202025-02-20%20at%2010.41.51%E2%80%AFAM.png?csf=1&web=1&e=BDf1Qj&CID=4a20debd-b7f3-49b1-a21f-92b500d22f7c starting with 10:38:04. My suspicion is this has to do with high resources usage on the appliance.

Hi, 
	 - 	Did you check if this PHP error did not appear in the previous version?

2. Before starting the upgrade, what version of EPP did the client have?
3. How many computers have been installed? How many policies? How many computers are assigned to a policy?

4. The error that the DevOps mentioned usually appears when the memory limit needs to be increased. As I understand the memory limit is increased to 512M.
4.1. Did you restart the php after you changed the memory_limit flag?
4.2. Did you check with someone from support to see if the 512M is enough?
4.3. Did you check the refresh interval from the settings page?

5. Can you try to comment on the udates_lastseen.php script from crontab? If not, please do the following:

--- CODE ---
#php /opt/eppcache/updates_lastseen.php  
--- CODE ---

6. Clear the mcache

--- CODE ---
rm -rf /run/shm/mcache/lastseenupdates/*
--- CODE ---

Finally, you must clear the cache by running the following command:

--- CODE ---
php /EPPServer/sieratool/symfony cc

--- CODE ---

7. Also, can you check the client software upgrade page? Did the customer create a new upgrade job?
This can cause also php errors. If the customer has an upgrade job available please deactivate it.



Please follow all these steps and check if the error appears again.
