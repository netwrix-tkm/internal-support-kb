@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Andre,

Could you potentially check to see if this might be related to the internal iptables drop rules that we have for dropping multiple requests from the same IP.

I would suggest checking if the iptables rules are saved under `/etc/` under the iptables directory

If the rules are saved please proceed to issue `iptables -F` this will flush all of the rules and the endpoints should start to communicate.

If that is the case then we should remove that drop rule from the iptables save, or increase the count.

Hi Andre,

I hope you are well.

Please see below feedback from devops:
""If the server now works in a stable manner and its resources are not so heavily used as to fill up all available memory and CPU from the increased  number of requests that follow the change, they should let the server as is. Otherwise the number should be reduced until the server gets to a better resource usage.""

Cristi
