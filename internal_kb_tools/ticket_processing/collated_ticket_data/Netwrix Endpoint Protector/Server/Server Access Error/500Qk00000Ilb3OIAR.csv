"500Qk00000Ilb3OIAR","00428041","Support Ticket","User accounts have been disabled or passwords have been reset","Hi,
None of our accounts are able to access the Endpoint Protector admin console.
The message displayed is 'The username or password entered is incorrect'.
Since there is no link to reset our password, could you please do the necessary?
I don't understand why this happened but it may be related to you restarting our server (cf. Ticket 00427922) last week.
Kind regards,
Julien Millet, Astorg","","","","password was reset from the backend, the customer confirmed he can log in","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","0.3","Closed - Resolved","Astorg Group SÃ rl","Julien Millet","2024-11-25T15:42:08.000Z","2024-11-25T22:26:52.000Z"
