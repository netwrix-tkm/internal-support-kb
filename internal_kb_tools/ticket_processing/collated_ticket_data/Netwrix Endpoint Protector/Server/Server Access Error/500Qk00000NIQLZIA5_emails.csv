As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

To recap what we've done:

1. You created a snapshot of the EPP appliance in your virtual environment.
2. Allowed the port 62828 for SSH connectivity.
3.We connected from our side through Putty and changed the password.

Can you confirm that you could access the console properly afterwards?
