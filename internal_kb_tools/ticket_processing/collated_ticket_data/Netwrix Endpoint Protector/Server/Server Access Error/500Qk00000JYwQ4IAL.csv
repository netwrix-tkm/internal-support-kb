"500Qk00000JYwQ4IAL","00429991","Support Ticket","Server Down Can't Access","Getting Nginx Error 500 when trying to access the server through the web. The server is not responding. I don't have SSH access to the server. This is the second time this has occurred in two weeks. Please help. I can't access any of my clients' machines settings.","","There was a high RAM consumption and 1-2 parameters were not correctly set/were missing in one of the configuration files.

I did the following actions:
- rebooted the EPP server
- checked space and resource consumption
- removed cache and other files that were not needed
- optimized the resources(edited the mysql file)
- restarted the services

After these actions it seems that the RAM usage dropped by about 30%. I will leave this ticket open so we can monitor the issue together for 1-2 weeks. Please let me know if you notice any issues in the following days.","Waiting on customer to confirm if it is okay.","There was a high RAM consumption and 1-2 parameters were not correctly set/were missing in one of the configuration files.
