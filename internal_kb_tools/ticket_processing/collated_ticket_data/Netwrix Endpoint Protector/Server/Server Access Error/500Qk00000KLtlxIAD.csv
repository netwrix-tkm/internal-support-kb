"500Qk00000KLtlxIAD","00431422","Support Ticket","Unable to login to EPP server - All admin accounts locked out","Hi Support, 

Since the new year we are unable to login to our on premise EPP server, All admin account logins result in incorrect login message. Our admin accounts are all from our Active directory. We do not have a local account on the server so are unable to access.

When looking at the server gui, we can see that there is a CIFs error with it trying to reach out to the server we use to store the logs. It appears to have stopped storing these shortly before the end of last year. 

Are you able to help us get access?

Secondly, Ive had to create this account to open this ticket since i was unable to find details of an existing one. There may be another email associated with this server.

Many Thanks,

Laurence Anderson
