Server is down and OS corrupted. /dev /sda4 recovering journal. 

kindly share default root ID and password.","","21-05 The customer, Choice International, contacted us regarding a server outage and a corrupted Ubuntu operating system.
We have call them and organise a remote session .

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
tried to access the backend of the server through the EPP VM console
we have restarted the machine and the issue persisted
tried to access the GRUB menu and each time we select to access the console or the boot option the page was returning to the first page
we have shut down the old machine and create a new one
on the new machine we have used the same IP as the previous one
added the ssl certificate and we were able to access the EPP UI with both option (IP and FQDN) 
next step was to upload the license
we update the EPP server to the latest version 5.9.4.1
As we agreed this case will be closed since the issue has been fixed.","21-05 We sent them the zoom link.

Customer will check how the client update is working and let us know if we can proceed with the closure of this case.","The issue was resolved by provisioning a new virtual machine to replace the failed Endpoint Protector server. The new VM was configured with the same IP address as the original server. The SSL certificate was reinstalled, and the Endpoint Protector UI became accessible via both IP and FQDN. The product license was re-uploaded, and the server was updated to the latest version (5.9.4.1). After these steps, normal access and functionality were restored. The customer was able to proceed with client updates and confirmed successful recovery.","Server/Infrastructure Issue - Customer-Managed System","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","12.4","Closed - Resolved","Techsol Infosec","umesh shetty","2025-05-21T06:22:03.000Z","2025-06-02T15:08:07.000Z"
