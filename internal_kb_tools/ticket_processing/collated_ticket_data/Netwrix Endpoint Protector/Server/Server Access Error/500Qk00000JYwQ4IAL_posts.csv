I did the following actions:
- rebooted the EPP server
- checked space and resource consumption
- removed cache and other files that were not needed
- optimized the resources(edited the mysql file)
- restarted the services

After these actions it seems that the RAM usage dropped by about 30%. I will leave this ticket open so we can monitor the issue together for 1-2 weeks. Please let me know if you notice any issues in the following days.","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-01-10T17:35:11.000Z"
