We’ve encountered a login issue with our on-premises EPP server. There haven't been any changes to the configuration, but suddenly we're unable to access the portal. We're using the same password that was previously working, but it’s no longer allowing us to log in.

Could you please advise on steps to resolve this issue?

Thanks and regards,","","","","Reset root password.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","NONE","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin - Reseller","Nayan Rajore","2024-10-18T05:37:04.000Z","2024-10-18T07:16:58.000Z"
