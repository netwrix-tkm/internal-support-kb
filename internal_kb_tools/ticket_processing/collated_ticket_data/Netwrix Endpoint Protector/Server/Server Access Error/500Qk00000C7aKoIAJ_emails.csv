Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy.
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer.
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ?

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ?

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.
So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser.

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Daniel,

 

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

 

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.

So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.
So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser.

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy.
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer.
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ?

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ?

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

 

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser.

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy.
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer.
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ?

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ?

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

 

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

 

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.

So could you please provide the proper solution.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.
So could you please provide the proper solution.


Thanks & Regards,

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser.

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy.
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer.
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ?

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ?

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

 

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

 

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.

So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.
So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity.

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser.

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy.
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer.
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ?

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ?

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,
After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console.
However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.
Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.
Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ?

Today @5 PM
Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM - 9 PM

Hello Daniel,

 

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

 

>> Same we are trying to explain you , we are receiving the hight disk alert in console and need to clear disk space now hence we required the backed server access.

So could you please provide the proper solution.

Hello Rajesh,

Thank you for your response.

We received a high disk space alert. To resolve this, we need access to the backend server.
In the EPP web console, there is already an alert that will be generated as soon as the disk reach 80% of his capacity. 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?When attempting to access, we encountered a need for GRUB and login details to reboot & login the server. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.
Here I was referring to the web console, which is accessible through the browser. 

As I mentioned in my previous email the login details to the EPP server backend are not share with our customers, without a disclosure.

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,

Hello Ravindra, Sakshi,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The backend of the server is showing only the settings and not the ssh access due to our security policy. 
In order to gain access to it you will have to sign a disclaimer, after that our management department will analyse it and will provide an answer. 
Based on their answer we can provide you the credentials to access the backend console or not.
Could you please let us know if that is what you would like to achieve ? 

The EPP web console was not accessible ? Did you encounter any internet interruptions in the last days or electricity outages ? 

What error message was displayed when you tried to access it?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel /Sakshi,

After rebooting the server from the cluster, we are able to access the DLP console. 

However, our concern is that while accessing the backend server from the cluster, only the DLP configuration settings appear in the window, and the server console is not showing.

Additionally, the server username and password are incorrect on the backend server. When our Linux team tries to reset the password, it asks for the GRUB passphrase.

Please check and confirm if we have the passphrase or if there is any option to reset it.

 

Do you receive any errors ? No

Also, can you please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for this week, so we can schedule a short session ? 

 

Today @5 PM

Tomorrow :- in between 10 AM – 9 PM
