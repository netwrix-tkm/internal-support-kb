"500Qk00000ORc3NIAT","00443186","Support Ticket","OTP not accepted","while putting the OTP, its not accepting","","28.04:
We asked the customer for more information and also for a screenshot of the error.
---
We had a remote session with the customer and it was about 2FA, not OPT.
We disabled the 2FA from the database (update sf_guard_user set use_google_authentication=0 where id=...;) and then in the EPP console, we saw that the Current time server is not synchronized.
The customer needs to add the appropriated  NTP server and then to test again with the 2FA.

29.04:
We asked again if they configured the NTP server and we wait for their feedback.

30.04:
The customer told us that the 2FA issue is solved and he has another request.
We opened a new ticket for the disk usage request (#00443652) and we will continue there.","28.04:
Awaiting the customer's reply.
---
We await the customer's feedback regarding the way 2FA works after changing the NTP server.

29.04:
Awaiting customer's response regarding the NTP server configuration.

30.04:
Awaiting customer's feedback and then closing the ticket.

01.05:
Since there is no feedback from the customer for now, I will close this ticket and he can reopen in case of any issue related to 2FA.","After the remote session, we agreed with the customer that it is not an OTP issue.
The real problem was that he was using 2FA and the NTP server wasn't correctly configured.
After he configured correctly the NTP server, the Current time server should have been synchronized and he confirmed that the 2FA is working as expected.","Authentication Issue","Oana Sutoiu","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","5.9.4.2","6.2","Closed - Resolved","Denave India Pvt Ltd","Amit Tomar","2025-04-25T09:26:10.000Z","2025-05-01T15:05:26.000Z"
