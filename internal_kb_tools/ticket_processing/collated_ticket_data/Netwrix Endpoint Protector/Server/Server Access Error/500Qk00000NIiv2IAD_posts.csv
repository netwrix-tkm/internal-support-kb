Client did the snapshot first then we accessed the back up.
From what we've found they had the 5th partition full so we went on an removed the old backups along with the shadows and upgrade patch backups(client agreed with all of them).
After that, about 10% of the partition was occupied and we tried to access the portal again.
He was able to get in successfully.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-25T13:34:52.000Z"
