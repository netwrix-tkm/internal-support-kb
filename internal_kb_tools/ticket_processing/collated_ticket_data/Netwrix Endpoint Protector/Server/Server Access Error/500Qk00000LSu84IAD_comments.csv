Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Related to ""CSR certificate and then the customer generated a new certificate based on it, but after applying it in the backend nginx failed""

I saw that you followed procedure 26, importing an EPP certificate. What I noticed is that you didn't follow step 2 correctly, which can cause the Nginx error.
FROM

--- CODE ---
sudo cp -p /var/www/EPPServer/CA/private/server.key /var/www/EPPServer/CA/private/server.key.old
--- CODE ---

TO

--- CODE ---
sudo cp -p /var/www/EPPServer/CA/server.key /var/www/EPPServer/CA/server.key.old
--- CODE ---

Please follow the procedure again in the right way.


Related to ""checked epp.nginx.conf file - looked okay. Also added port 8443 instead of 443, but UI was still giving the same error.""
You change the port but the server listening port may be incorrect.

Check the server listening port, and replace the epp.nginx.conf

1. Check if the server is listening on the correct port

Run:

--- CODE ---
netstat -tulnp | grep 8443
--- CODE ---

If you don’t see a line with LISTEN, it means the server is not running on port 8443.

--- CODE ---
netstat -tulnp | grep 443
--- CODE ---

If you don’t see a line with LISTEN, it means the server is not running on port 443.
Also, you can find the server listening port by running:

--- CODE ---
netstat -tulnp
--- CODE ---

 If the server is NOT listening on port 8443 → Check your Nginx configuration and restart it:

--- CODE ---
 sudo service nginx restart
--- CODE ---

2. Check the firewall

3. Check if the server is accessible from the network

Ping again the server: ping IP
If the server does not respond, check DNS settings and network configurations.
Test connection port: telnet IP
If the port is not reachable, it might be blocked by a firewall or network rules.

5. Check Nginx error logs for issues


--- CODE ---sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
--- CODE ---
