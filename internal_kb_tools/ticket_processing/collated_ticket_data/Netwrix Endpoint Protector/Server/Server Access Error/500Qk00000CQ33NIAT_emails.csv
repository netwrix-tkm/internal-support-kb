Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi,

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Can you advise where the data should be?

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi,

 

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

I'm glad to hear that the EPP server is up and running.
Have you manage to login on the web interface as well ?  Is everything in place ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Sorry to chase, but we need to get this server back online ASAP.

 

Can you advise of when we will be receiving a callback?

Hi,

 

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

 

 

Regards

Phil

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Can we please organise a teams chat to discuss the options?

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,

 

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,

 

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Any idea of timescale for when the developer will contact us.

 

I am being chased internally regarding this so we need to get it up as soon as possible, the senior management would prefer by tonight.

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi,

Sorry I need to re-open this call.

We have the same issue where the database is lost and the database went back to 5.8.1 and there was no data, had to use default username and password


We powered off teh server, and took a snapshot

We powered the server back on

The system then appeared to be down, but it actually had lost the certificate.

The system was then rebooted again, and we had day one settings
I have updated the system to 5.9.3 and trying to restore the backup from today.

Thank you for getting back to us.

Does the machine have 2 disk? It is possible that you have access the old one after the restart.

Since the issue is now gone, is there anything that we can assist you with ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Does the machine have 2 disk? It is possible that you have access the old one after the restart.

Since the issue is now gone, is there anything that we can assist you with ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,

Sorry I need to re-open this call.

We have the same issue where the database is lost and the database went back to 5.8.1 and there was no data, had to use default username and password

We powered off teh server, and took a snapshot

We powered the server back on

The system then appeared to be down, but it actually had lost the certificate.

The system was then rebooted again, and we had day one settings
I have updated the system to 5.9.3 and trying to restore the backup from today.

Thank you for your prompt response.

If the EPP server IP have in your DNS server a domain name assigned, then the answer is yes. This can be done, on a future installation where instead of IP use the domain name.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

 

Sorry I need to re-open this call.

We have the same issue where the database is lost and the database went back to 5.8.1 and there was no data, had to use default username and password

We powered off teh server, and took a snapshot

We powered the server back on

The system then appeared to be down, but it actually had lost the certificate.

The system was then rebooted again, and we had day one settings

I have updated the system to 5.9.3 and trying to restore the backup from today.

 

Regards
Phil

Hello Phil,

Thank you for your prompt response.

If the EPP server IP have in your DNS server a domain name assigned, then the answer is yes. This can be done, on a future installation where instead of IP use the domain name.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

Sorry, we would like when software installed on new clients to use the domain name instead of ip of the server.

Also when the software is updated onto existing clients it would use a domain name.

Do you want to access the web console using a domain name (ex: epp.test.com) or you would like that when install new clients to type domain name instead of ip of the server?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Does the machine have 2 disk? It is possible that you have access the old one after the restart.

Since the issue is now gone, is there anything that we can assist you with ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hi guys,

A few weeks back we discussed on a call to add a tenable agent on our EPP box. I'll need to provide access for you but if you could run this command I would appreciate it.

curl -H 'X-Key: c8101661fe633c3d025caa974c75c01cfb8c86fe2538043e4dd866d636871634' 'https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent?name=LQ-VM-EPP-PRD&groups=All Agents' | bash

Kind regards

Matt.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for your email.
My colleague Daniel is out of office for the time being.
Regarding your previous email, are you requesting for a call, in which we will connect to the EPP server to run that curl command?

Hi guys,

 

A few weeks back we discussed on a call to add a tenable agent on our EPP box. I’ll need to provide access for you but if you could run this command I would appreciate it.

curl -H 'X-Key: c8101661fe633c3d025caa974c75c01cfb8c86fe2538043e4dd866d636871634' 'https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent?name=LQ-VM-EPP-PRD&groups=All Agents' | bash 

 

Kind regards

 

Matt.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have successfully imported one of your old databases to the newly EPP server, which helps us to fix the issue. 

We will proceed with the closure of this case. 

Should you require any assistance or additional information please do not hesitate to contact us.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi,

 

I have successfully mounted the VHD onto a Windows device, but all the files I can see are dated back in 2023.

 

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN. 

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome. 

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your email.
My colleague Daniel is out of office for the time being.
Regarding your previous email, are you requesting for a call, in which we will connect to the EPP server to run that curl command?

Hi guys,

A few weeks back we discussed on a call to add a tenable agent on our EPP box. I'll need to provide access for you but if you could run this command I would appreciate it.

curl -H 'X-Key: c8101661fe633c3d025caa974c75c01cfb8c86fe2538043e4dd866d636871634' 'https://sensor.cloud.tenable.com/install/agent?name=LQ-VM-EPP-PRD&groups=All Agents' | bash

Kind regards

Matt.

Hello Phil,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have successfully imported one of your old databases to the newly EPP server, which helps us to fix the issue.

We will proceed with the closure of this case.

Should you require any assistance or additional information please do not hesitate to contact us.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back and apologize for my late response.

If the one we worked yesterday was the correct disk, from the initial EPP virtual machine, then you should use it as a singular disk and boot from it.

Most likely the snapshot from February contains the boot issue, so we do not recommend to use it.

Looking forward for your response.

Can you advise where the data should be?

If the data is lost, can we restore the SQL data from February please?

Hello Phil,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I have investigated internally and the patch would not change the IP/FQDN.

Could you please try with another browser, or in incognito mode and let us know the outcome.

If that would not help please provide us 2 3 slots with your availability for the next week so we can schedule a short remote session .

Looking forward for your response.
