This issue seems to be related to previous ticket ""00438343 - Server is Unreachable"" where our DevOps recommended to increase the instance type from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM) to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

Since our last email to you yesterday we have not yet received a response / approval from you to proceed with this action.  I have sent you another follow up email on that ticket, could you please respond on that threat? I think we can also close this case as it is related to the same issue of EPP Server becoming unreachable.

Hi Naveen,

This issue seems to be related to previous ticket ""00438343 - Server is Unreachable"" where our DevOps recommended to increase the instance type from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM) to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

Since our last email to you yesterday we have not yet received a response / approval from you to proceed with this action.  I have sent you another follow up email on that ticket, could you please respond on that threat? I think we can also close this case as it is related to the same issue of EPP Server becoming unreachable.



Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Yes, I can access it now.

Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.

Thanks!
