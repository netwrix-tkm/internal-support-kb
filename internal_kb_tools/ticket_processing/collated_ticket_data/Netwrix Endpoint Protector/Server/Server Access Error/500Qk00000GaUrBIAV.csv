"500Qk00000GaUrBIAV","00422833","Support Ticket","Unable To Access Netwrix EPP Server","Hello Team,

We are currently unable to access our EPP server through the web console and are encountering an error (please see the attached screenshot for reference). Upon checking the status of our EPP VM instance, we observed another error (screenshot attached). We attempted to resolve the issue by restarting the VM instance, but after doing so, the EPP VM terminal became stuck at initramfs (screenshot attached).

Could you please suggest steps to resolve this issue?
