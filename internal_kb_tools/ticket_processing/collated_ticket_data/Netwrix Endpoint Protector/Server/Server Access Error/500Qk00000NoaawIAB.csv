Please note that the server is unreachable since this morning. Since this happened in the past several times, we thought it would be accessible in sometime. 

Unfortunately, till now, server is not accessible.

Note: Even failover link is not accessible.

Thanks!","","This issue seems to be related to previous ticket ""00438343 - Server is Unreachable"" where our DevOps recommended to increase the instance type for hosted EPP Server Appliance from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM) to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.","This issue seems to be related to previous ticket ""00438343 - Server is Unreachable"" where our DevOps recommended to increase the instance type from c6i.xlarge (8 GB RAM) to m6i.xlarge (16 GB RAM) as we observed that this problem can be caused by continuous RAM memory entering in swap.

Since our last email to you yesterday we have not yet received a response / approval from you to proceed with this action.  I have sent you another follow up email on that ticket, could you please respond on that threat?
