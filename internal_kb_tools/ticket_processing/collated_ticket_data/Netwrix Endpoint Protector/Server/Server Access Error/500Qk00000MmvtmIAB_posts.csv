Please note that the server has been unreachable for the past hour. If any maintenance activity is being performed, why were we not informed?

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-11T06:20:46.000Z"

DevOps had a look and said that the EPP Server ""stopped sending metrics"" and then did a restart of the EPP Server. After the restart the EPP Server was back up and running and the customer could access the UI again.

The customer wants to know what caused the Server to become unresponsive and complained that this is the third time where they had an issue accessing the EPP Server's UI.
They want us to prevent this situation from happening again and asked us to investigate the root cause of the issue.

I have checked the disk space and have done status reports on the services, everything looks okay (attached are screenshots).","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-18T17:02:30.000Z"

11/04/2025 - Customer's remaining question:
""Also, we would like to know whether you have any internal monitoring to alert if the server goes down. This could help to identify and resolve the issue asap.""

We informed the customer that we are aiming to implement a feature that would send alerts and transform them into SalesForce tickets so that the Netwrix Support Engineers give a reply and proceed with required steps based on priority but this requires integration between different department tools and it might take a while but we will inform customer once this would be available.

Proceeding to closing this ticket now as solved.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-11T09:37:15.000Z"
