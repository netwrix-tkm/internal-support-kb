I just received the new license file for our renewal. I was going to apply it, but I am running into this issue, which is why I think martin reached out originally. 
Let me know if you have some availability tomorrow or Thursday, or if it’s a simple fix, just send it over and I’ll try it. 
I believe our license expires on the 9th of this month. 

Thanks, 

Dominic","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-02-04T19:58:22.000Z"

- different browsers
- http - client download page is accessible
- ifconfig looks okay
- services are running(nginx, php, mysql)
- rebooted the EPP server 2 times
- added in epp.nginx.conf file TLSv1.3(already had 1 and 1.2 added)
- checked epp.nginx.conf file - looked okay. Also added port 8443 instead of 443, but UI was still giving the same error.
- customer said that the ports were not blocked and that there is no firewall between the computer we tested on and the VM where the EPP server is hosted.
