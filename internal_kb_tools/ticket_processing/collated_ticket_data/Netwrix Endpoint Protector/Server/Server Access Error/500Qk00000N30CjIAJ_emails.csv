Hello Marian,

 

Thank you! The certificate has been uploaded and is functioning as expected.

 

However, we are facing a new issue where some Linux machines are online but
appear offline in the EPP console. Could you please share a troubleshooting
guide along with the name of the EPP service that we can restart to verify
the status?

 

Of course, I will raise a new ticket for this but your quick help will be
appreciated.

 


Thanks & Regards,

Thank you for the confirmation.

I am glad to hear that the issue with the SSL certificate has been sorted out.

In regards of the Linux machines, I would recommend to raise this as a separate ticket and we will take it from there with you because we need to separate the issues so we can have only one problem per ticket.

Also, for this problem, we would need more details before coming up with a response, therefore please raise a ticket with us.

Let me know if you have other inquiries related to the SSL certificate or if it's ok to close the case.
