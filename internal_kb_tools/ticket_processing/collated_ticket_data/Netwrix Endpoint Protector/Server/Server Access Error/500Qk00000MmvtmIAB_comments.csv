Hi,

Check CPU and RAM Usage: 

--- CODE ---
htop
--- CODE ---

Already check df -h

Check MySQL configuration:

--- CODE ---
vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
--- CODE ---

Is it configured correctly based on the server resources?

Check also the currently running processes from MySQL:

--- CODE ---
mysqladmin processlist -u root -p
--- CODE ---

Check the system logs for Nginx, you can use the following commands:

--- CODE ---
journalctl -u nginx --no-pager --lines=50
journalctl -u nginx -f.
--- CODE ---

Check Nginx Error Logs:

--- CODE ---
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
--- CODE ---

Â Check Nginx Access Logs:

--- CODE ---
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
--- CODE ---



--- CODE ---
dmesg | grep -i nginx
--- CODE ---



From my point of view, it may help if also someone from the DevOps team takes a look to check if can find something that helps us to determine why the server was down. @WaitingOnDevOps
