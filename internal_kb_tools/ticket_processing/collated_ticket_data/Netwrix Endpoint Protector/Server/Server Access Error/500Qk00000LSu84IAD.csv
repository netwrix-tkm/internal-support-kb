"500Qk00000LSu84IAD","00434625","Support Ticket","EPP error","Hello again, 

I just received the new license file for our renewal. I was going to apply it, but I am running into this issue, which is why I think martin reached out originally. 
Let me know if you have some availability tomorrow or Thursday, or if it’s a simple fix, just send it over and I’ll try it. 
I believe our license expires on the 9th of this month. 

Thanks, 

Dominic","","CIPHER SSL error is no longer present, but we got ERR_CONNECTION_RESET, but only on the EPP UI page, other webpages were accessible. Tried the below:

- different browsers
- http - client download page is accessible
- ifconfig looks okay
- services are running(nginx, php, mysql)
- rebooted the EPP server 2 times
- added in epp.nginx.conf file TLSv1.3(already had 1 and 1.2 added)
- checked epp.nginx.conf file - looked okay. Also added port 8443 instead of 443, but UI was still giving the same error.
- customer said that the ports were not blocked and that there is no firewall between the computer we tested on and the VM where the EPP server is hosted.

CIPHER SSL error","05Feb: Raised R&D escalation. 

04Feb: Scheduling RS.","Resolved by editing epp.nginx.conf file and removing TLSv1 . TLSv1.3 - UI was accessible, but EPP clients did not communicate. Added TLSv1.2 and then both UI and EPP clients worked/communicated.

Also:
- cleared system disk space from 77% occupied to around 50%
- optimized the resources - this should help with UI performance/speed
- applied all backend security upgrades","","Flaviu Moldovan","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","","","6.0","Closed - Resolved","Viskase Companies","Martin Polaszewski","2025-02-04T19:58:21.000Z","2025-02-10T20:57:42.000Z"
