Please let us know if you are using SSO solutions like OKTA or Azure SSO. Also, mention of 2FA is enabled.
Also, the auto-fill solution sometimes causes this kind of issue as it automatically sends the user to the next authentication step.

For testing purposes, please try to introduce the password manually or copy/paste it for a while, and see if the issue still persists.

The behavior is not consistent but my password is since I am auto-filling that from my 1Password entry for Endpoint Protector. Please let me know what other information you need to troubleshoot this.
