Hi Botond,

I confirm I can access tbe console again.

We don’t have AD authentication enabled as our server is hosted on your systems and cannot reach our domain controllers.

However, I see that it is possible to enable AzureAD authentication. Can you confirm that it would work from a hosted instance? If this is the case, I will set this up so I can avoid this kind of issue.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Hi Botond,

I’m not talking about the ‘Microsoft Active Directory’ option but the ‘Azure Active Directory’ one that doesn’t need to connect to our AD server but to Azure (or now EntraID). The Internet connection requirement would more be on the Endpoint protector server side…

I will try to enroll it tomorrow.

Kind regards,

Hi Julien,

It should work, if you require assistance, you can open a different ticket, since we can only track one issue per ticket.
Since the login issue was solved, is it ok if I close this ticket?

Hi Botond,

I’m not talking about the ‘Microsoft Active Directory’ option but the ‘Azure Active Directory’ one that doesn’t need to connect to our AD server but to Azure (or now EntraID). The Internet connection requirement would more be on the Endpoint protector server side…

I will try to enroll it tomorrow.

Kind regards,

Julien.

Hi Julien,

Thanks for the confirmation!
If you AD server has internet access, it should work.

Hi Botond,



I confirm I can access tbe console again.



We don’t have AD authentication enabled as our server is hosted on your systems and cannot reach our domain controllers.



However, I see that it is possible to enable AzureAD authentication. Can you confirm that it would work from a hosted instance? If this is the case, I will set this up so I can avoid this kind of issue.



Thank you in advance.



Kind regards,

Hi Julien,

We reset your password - epp2011
Could you please check if you have AD authentication enabled?
