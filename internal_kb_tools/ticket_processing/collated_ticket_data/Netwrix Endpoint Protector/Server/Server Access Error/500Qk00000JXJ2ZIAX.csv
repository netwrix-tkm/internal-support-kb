Please note that the server console has not been accessible since this morning. It just keeps reloading after the SSO authentication. Refer to the attached video.

Note: We upgraded the version to 5.9.4.1 on Friday, and it was working fine the same day. However, we suspect this could be the reason.

Consider this a priority and get back to us as soon as possible.

Thanks!","","","","Issue resolved.","","Andrei Pop","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Access Error","NONE","","3.1","Closed - Resolved","Avrioc Technologies","Naveen Kumar","2024-12-16T06:47:55.000Z","2024-12-19T10:11:16.000Z"
