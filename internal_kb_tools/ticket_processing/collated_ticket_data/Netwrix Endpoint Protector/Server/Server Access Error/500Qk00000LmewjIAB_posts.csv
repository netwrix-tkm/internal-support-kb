Greetings to you!

Currently our customer - Viettel telecom is going through a POC. However, they encountered the following problem: They downloaded the Cososys virtual machine file OVF and imported that virtual machine file onto their Openstack system. 
However, when they ran that virtual machine file, they got an error and could not access the Cososys server portal.
Specifically as shown in the attached image on the ticket. 
Please find the attachments on the support portal. 

And one more note is that our customer environment has absolutely no internet.

Hope to receive help from you and the team soon.

Thank you.
Milan Singh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-12T05:09:38.000Z"
