Ticket Number: 00423798
Ticket Subject: TLS non permette accesso alla console via browser
Ticket Details: Gentile assistenza,
sono Elia della ditta Auriga Srl, abbiamo acquistato l'Endpoint Protector
per un nostro cliente: ultimamente il cliente ci riferisce che non riesce ad
accedere alla console di gestione dell'EPP a meno che non vada a declassare
il TLS del browser a 1, quindi il più basso possibile. 
Abbiamo provato ad aggiornare il software all'ultima versione ma il problema
persiste. Da cosa potrebbe essere causato? Come si può risolvere questo
problema?
Attendo una vostra gentile risposta.

Cordiali saluti,
Elia

Hi Adrian,

the migration has been completed correctly, we keep everything monitored for
the next few days.

 

There is the options to upgrade all the clients version from the server
console or they need to do every single client?

Dear Elia,

For the migration the steps would be:
1) Importing the new appliance in VM
2) Starting the new appliance on a different IP which is available in the
customer's network
3) On the Old appliance -making sure it is at version 5940 ( its a must that
both appliances to have same server version so that the migration can be
done) - from System Maintenance > System Backup V2 - need to create a backup
and do not forget to save the Key.
4) Import the backup in the new appliance in same menu from System
Maintenance > System Backup V2.
5) Shut down the old appliance or move it on a different IP
6) Assign the old IP to the new appliance so that the already installed
clients can communicate with the new server
7) Enjoy our product! :)

Good Morning,

the client created a new VM with Ubuntu 22.

How much time do we need to install the EPP? Is something we can do on our
own? If no I need to ask the client for his availability for a remote
connection.

 

In one of the last email there was the following .zip:
Endpoint-Protector-5.9.4.0-Virtual-Appliance-MNL257. There is something
else the client need to download/prepare for the installation and
activation?

 

Thanks for your patience,

Elia

Good Morning,

the client created a new VM with Ubuntu 22.

How much time do we need to install the EPP? Is something we can do on our
own? If no I need to ask the client for his availability for a remote
connection.

 

In one of the last email there was the following .zip:
Endpoint-Protector-5.9.4.0-Virtual-Appliance-MNL257. There is something
else the client need to download/prepare for the installation and
activation?

 

Thanks for your patience,

Elia

Ticket Number: 00423798
Ticket Subject: TLS non permette accesso alla console via browser
Ticket Details: Gentile assistenza,
sono Elia della ditta Auriga Srl, abbiamo acquistato l'Endpoint Protector
per un nostro cliente: ultimamente il cliente ci riferisce che non riesce ad
accedere alla console di gestione dell'EPP a meno che non vada a declassare
il TLS del browser a 1, quindi il più basso possibile.
Abbiamo provato ad aggiornare il software all'ultima versione ma il problema
persiste. Da cosa potrebbe essere causato? Come si può risolvere questo
problema?
Attendo una vostra gentile risposta.

Cordiali saluti,
Elia

Thank you!
