If you have access to another admin user, you can change your password from System Configuration -> System Administrators.
If you don't, we can schedule a remote session and reset it from the backend.

Hi Botond,

Thanks for your swift reply. I'm afraid I don't have another admin user account. Looks like we'll need to schedule a remote session.

Does this mean you will need credentials for the host on which CoSoSys is running? Also, is there anything I should prepare ahead of our call?

Regards,
