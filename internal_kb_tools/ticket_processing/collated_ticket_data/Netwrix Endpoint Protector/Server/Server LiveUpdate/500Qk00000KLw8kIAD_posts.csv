I tried to udpate from 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1 and I received Error 5, some details details with checksum error, different than the Live Update.
I waited couple of minutes and then checked again for updates and now the error is saying that ""Number of maximum retries reached, skipping this update..""
thanks,
Daniel","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-08T09:38:40.000Z"
