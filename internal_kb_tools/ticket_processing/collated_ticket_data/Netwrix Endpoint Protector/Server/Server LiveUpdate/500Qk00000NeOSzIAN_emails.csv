Here is the download link for the offline patch:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500675942.tar.gz

You can apply the patch accessing Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader -> select the patch (in the same format .tar.gz) -> Apply Update -> wait until you see the notification regarding the Offline patch being applied -> Click again on Dashboard -> Live Update -> And you can see the update process -> Once the patch is applied refresh the EPP UI and check if the server version is updated.

I will ask you to take a snapshot of the EPP Server before you will apply the patch.

Best regards,
Emil
