Hi Dragatis,

Thank you for your email.
I have raised this issue internally, and I will follow up with updates, once available.
I am not sure exactly what happened there, or if the updates were applied at all in the first place,
or they were just ""missing"" temporarily.

Hello Adrian,

 

as you can see there are some updates available again and I tried to install them just to see if the problem is solved.

And unfortunately they still don’t get installed … it looks exactly the same to me like it did before our meeting on Monday.

 

Nothing more happens after I click on “Apply..”:


 

 

And the logs look like this:

Hi Dragatis,

Thank you for your email.
I have raised this issue internally, and I will follow up with updates, once available.
I am not sure exactly what happened there, or if the updates were applied at all in the first place,
or they were just ""missing"" temporarily.

Hello Adrian,

as you can see there are some updates available again and I tried to install them just to see if the problem is solved.
And unfortunately they still don't get installed ... it looks exactly the same to me like it did before our meeting on Monday.

Nothing more happens after I click on ""Apply.."":
