I think someone just jumped the gun on posting that it was available in the live updates section when it really was not, or at least not for all people.   it was there when I checked later.

It is a good idea to let whoever posts that sort of thing that a little note saying to check later if it is not there would save everyone some time.   I would not have opened the ticket and you would not have had to deal with one.

you can close this.

Hi Veronica,

If the update shows up in the Applied Updates section, it was successfully installed.

thanks.   one last question – I did install the hotfix, but it still shows up in the available update section.  Is that normal?  the applied software section shows it as applied, but it’s a litte confusing to see it there still.

I think someone just jumped the gun on posting that it was available in the live updates section when it really was not, or at least not for all people.   it was there when I checked later.  

 

It is a good idea to let whoever posts that sort of thing that a little note saying to check later if it is not there would save everyone some time.   I would not have opened the ticket and you would not have had to deal with one. 

 

you can close this.
