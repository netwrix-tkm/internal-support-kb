Customer name is PrivatBank.
They updated EPP server version to 5.9.4.1.
But after checking the server security update, it returned ""No updates available"", but the last security updates were installed on 2024-03-30.
Could you please check if there were some security updates for Server Ubuntu 18.04 at this period of time?
Attaching screenshot.","","Client asked if customer can upgrade the server distributive version only by migrating to the new instance.
Alternatively,  they want to know if it can be potentially done just by upgrading the backend version","Informed them about the upgradation process that can be done through migration from 18.04 to 22.04.","Informed the client about the migration procedure.","","Marian Ilies","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","NONE","","7.2","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","CoreWin Tech","2025-03-03T08:33:28.000Z","2025-03-10T13:10:04.000Z"
