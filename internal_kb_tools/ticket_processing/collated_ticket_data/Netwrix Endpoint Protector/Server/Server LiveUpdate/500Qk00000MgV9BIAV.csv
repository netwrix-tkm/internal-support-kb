"500Qk00000MgV9BIAV","00438111","Support Ticket","Need assistance applying backend security updates","Hello,

I need to apply the latest EPP software update to our EPP appliance, and I need an EPP engineer to assist me in applying backend security updates on March 26, 2025, at 8 PM PST.  I need confirmation that an EPP engineer will be able to assist me before I make the request to patch the EPP appliance on March 26.  Preferably Emil, since he's familiar with what needs to be done.

I had issues applying backend security updates from the EPP console on our test appliance and needed Emil Podar’s help to patch it.  After several attempts, he made some backend changes before he was able to apply the security updates.

I’ve been trying to get ahold of Emil via email to schedule a date and time to patch our production environment but have not received a response from him.

Best,
Spencer","","The customer needs assistance to appy the backend security updates","A remote session was scheduled with the customer in order to apply the security update
