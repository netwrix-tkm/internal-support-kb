"500Qk00000DrKAqIAN","00416809","Support Ticket","Backend Updates not applying","Hello,

first I want to mention that we have server version 5.9.4.0, but since I cannot select it here, I took 5.9.3.0.
We are having this issue several month now and we already created a ticket #413046 because of it, but I can't response to it since we closed it too long ago. I wanted to wait until the server update to 5.9.4.0 and see if the problem gets solved - but unfortunatley that is not the case.
We have the problem, that the server backend updates seem to no get applied anymore since may. If i click on ""Apply Backend Updates"" nothing more than ""Applying Backend Updates"" happen - they seem to not get installed.
In the admin action log we can see that the update somehow got not applied.

I hope we can find a solution for this problem.

Thank you in advance.
