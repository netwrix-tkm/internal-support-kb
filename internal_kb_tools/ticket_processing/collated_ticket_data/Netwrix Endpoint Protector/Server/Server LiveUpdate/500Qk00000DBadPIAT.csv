My name is Shawn and I'm reaching out on behalf of Fastco Canada.
After installing the EPP Hotfix #1.1 via the Live Update section of our EPP portal, we saw the message advising that the patch was successfully installed however the update still shows as available under live updates. I just wanted to reach out and confirm this was normal behavior, or if the update should no longer show up once successfully installed?

Regards,
Shawn","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","NONE","","77.0","Closed - Resolved","Fastco Canada","Don Dee","2024-07-17T13:00:43.000Z","2024-10-02T14:02:00.000Z"
