Thank you for your email.
That is correct- we are aware of the lingering update, even after it was applied.
Applying it multiple times = applying it once.
For now, please ignore the multiple applications, and also the fact that the update lingers,
This will be addressed in the upcoming patch server and the update will go away if it was applied once/multiple times.
Thank you for your understanding and for your patience meanwhile.
