Customer name is PrivatBank.
They updated EPP server version to 5.9.4.1.
But after checking the server security update, it returned ""No updates available"", but the last security updates were installed on 2024-03-30.
Could you please check if there were some security updates for Server Ubuntu 18.04 at this period of time?

Seems like this would be caused to the Ubuntu 18.04 EOL and suggested to use a new Ubuntu OS.
Will wait for their response.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-03T10:41:24.000Z"
