We applied the Live Update for hotfix v1.1, even though the processed first finished, and we can see the hotfix in the list of Applied EPP Software Updates, Available EPP Software Updates still shows the update for the hotfix v1.1.

Is this happened because we have a custom config?
Can we have a session to check this in the backend as well?

Thanks.","","","","The patch was successfully applied","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","","","12.8","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Serhat Demir","2024-07-16T13:52:45.000Z","2024-07-29T09:56:49.000Z"
