I've just updated our server to the latest version (to 5.9.3.0 from 5.8.3.0)
now when I install the Hotfix #1.1 (HWA-EPP4-U8800) the GUI says that the Update has been installed but after ""check now"" the updates shows again, i also rebooted the Appliance, but the Update is still shown as available?

kind regards
