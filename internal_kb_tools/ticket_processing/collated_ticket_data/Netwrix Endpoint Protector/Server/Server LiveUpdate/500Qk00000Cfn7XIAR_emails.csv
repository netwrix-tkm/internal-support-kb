Hi Nick,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  As discussed on our call please do let me know when you have had the opportunity to test a Content Aware Protection policy and can confirm that new event logs are made under Content Aware Report on the EPP Server interface.

For the newly discovered SSH vulnerability, please open a new case with us and we will take this forward with high priority.


Kind regards

Hi Nick,

Thank you for the detail.  We will need a remote session and I would need to access the back-end of your EPP server to look at this issue.  On what platform is your EPP Server hosted, is it deployed on Premises?

Are you available today at 2 PM London time for a remote session?


Kind regards
