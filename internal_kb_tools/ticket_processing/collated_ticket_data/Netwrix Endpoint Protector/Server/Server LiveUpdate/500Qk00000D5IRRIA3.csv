"500Qk00000D5IRRIA3","00414986","Support Ticket","Problem with EPP Server Hotfix","Dear EPP-Team,
our EPP-Instance has an available update (Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 – Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)). When we install the update the appliance reports that the update was sucessfully installed. But when we scan for new updates the same update is shown again. Meanwhile the update is shown 9 times in the ""Applied EPP Software Updates""-View. The latest backend-updates are already installed. How can we fix this?","","","","This issue got fixed meanwhile","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","","","51.7","Closed - Resolved","Verbandsgemeinde (VG) Pirmasens (BiRoNet)","","2024-07-15T13:41:59.000Z","2024-09-05T07:34:48.000Z"
