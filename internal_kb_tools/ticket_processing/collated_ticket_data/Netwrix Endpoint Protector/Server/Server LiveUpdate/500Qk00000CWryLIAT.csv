"500Qk00000CWryLIAT","00413625","Support Ticket","Same update appears but never applies","""EPP Server Hotfix #1 - Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)""

Whenever we check for updates this update is available. We Apply Now, it seems to perform the update, but on checking again this same update appears.
Checking the Applied Updates page shows this same update has been applied 6 times but is always still available.

Is there an issue with this update that means it is not applying properly? I am concerned that this fixes the recent security advisory and the service may be left in a vulnerable state if the update is not applying properly.

Thanks.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","","","2.0","Closed - Resolved","Brokertech","Mike Smith","2024-07-01T16:37:35.000Z","2024-07-03T16:08:20.000Z"
