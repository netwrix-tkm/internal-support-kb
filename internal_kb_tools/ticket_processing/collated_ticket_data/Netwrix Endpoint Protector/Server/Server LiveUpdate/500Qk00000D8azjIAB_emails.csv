If the hotfix v1.1 appears in the Applied EPP Software Updates, then it was successfully applied.
This is a known bug that we have with this update.
The Hotfix v1.1 will disappear from the list of available patches after the EPP server is updated to the 5.4.0.0 version.

If you would like to have a remote session in order to check if the patch was applied, we can schedule a short meeting for later today or tomorrow.
Please let me know your availability.

I am not aware if the bug was shared anywhere as it was recently discovered, after the hotfix was released.

There will be no issues if the hotfix is applied again because it will just look for the specific files which have to be overwritten.

I will be available at 17:00 NL time. I just sent you a zoom meeting invitation.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Serhat,

If the hotfix v1.1 appears in the Applied EPP Software Updates, then it was successfully applied.
This is a known bug that we have with this update.
The Hotfix v1.1 will disappear from the list of available patches after the EPP server is updated to the 5.4.0.0 version.

Hello everyone,

We confirmed the hotfix update finished successfully with the custom
config, applied an offline patch for agent software, and performed agent
version updates in the Dev environment. Thanks Emil.

@Oana Nemes <oana.nemes@cososys.com>, I see that we have been left in the
dark regarding the process of applying the hotfix.
We were not informed about the aforementioned bug.
We were not informed about the necessity of applying the offline patch for
agent software, and Link to this offline patch is not shared with us in an
email or support ticket. Can you share this here again?
New agent versions are not shared for us to confirm.
Please kindly take these as feedback for improving the process and
experience.

Regards,
-serhat

Hi Serhat,

Thank you for confirming that the hotfix was applied on the Dev server and
for sharing your concerns and feedback. These were already shared with the
team.

Regarding the issue with the persistence of the hotfix under Dashboard >
Live Update > Available EPP Software Updates after the hotfix was applied,
as Emil pointed out this was not documented up until present moment. We'll
insist with the team for having it made public to customers.

The update about the availability of an offline patch that makes patched
agents available under System Configuration > Client Software/ Client
Software Upgrade was published and made available to members of teams
outside Netwrix Support Team today at 12:15PM EST (6:15PM Amsterdam time):

[image: Advisory_16JulUpdate.PNG]
The download link for this offline patch (same as in case of the hotfix and
patched clients before today's update of the advisory) is available inside
""ADV-2024-002 - Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint
Protector and CoSoSys Unify"" and I'm also including it below:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz

Please let us know if we can assist with other details about the latest
update included in the advisory.

Best regards,
Oana
