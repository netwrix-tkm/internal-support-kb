"500Qk00000CPlpdIAD","00413366","Support Ticket","Question regarding Security Advisory ADV-2024-002","Hello,

I just read through the Security Advisory and tried to apply the server side Patch - EPP Server Hotfix #1.
After the Updates it displays ""Patch applied successfully"" and I can also see the applied Patch in ""View applied EPP Software Updates"".

However, when I check for EPP Software Update again, the patch still shows up as available.

The other thing is that we have Client version 6.2.2.1 deplyed and in the Security Advisory it states the following: ""The Endpoint Protector server and the Endpoint Protector Client on all endpoints must both be updated to fully resolve the vulnerabilities.""

I see only version 6.2.2.1 on both the client software page and the client software upgrade page and thats the version we have currently rolled out.
Is there a newer client version available?

Regards,
Patrick Gross
