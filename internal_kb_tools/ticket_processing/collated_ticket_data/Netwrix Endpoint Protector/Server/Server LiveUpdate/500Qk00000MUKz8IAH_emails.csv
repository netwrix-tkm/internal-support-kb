Hello Danylo,

To respond to your inquiry, the upgradation process can actually be done through a migration from ubuntu 18.04 to a new EPP image on ubuntu 22.04.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Hello,

Do you know if customer can upgrade the server distributive version only by migrating to the new instance?
Or can it be potentially done just by upgrading the backend version?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.

I have done some research in regards of your issue and the problem is not related to our backend security updates but with the Ubuntu OS as the current version that Privat Bank has, it hit the end of life back in May 2023 therefore no new security updates are available for that version.

As an alternative, they can try to upgrade to a newer version such as Ubuntu 22.04 and we can help with the EPP server migration on the new image.

Looking forward to your response.
