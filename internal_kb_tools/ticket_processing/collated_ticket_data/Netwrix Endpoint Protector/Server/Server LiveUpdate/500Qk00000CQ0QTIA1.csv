I'm trying to apply EPP Server Hotfix #1 - Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)

as per your security directive.

however although it reports a successfull installation, if I check for updates again it offers it back up, so looks like we are stuck in a loop.

Please advise","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002
