We have just attempted to update our Endpoint Protector Server from Version 5.9.4.0 to 5.9.4.1 to patch the 'Critical Vulnerabilities' mentioned, though have received an error message within the first minute of this attempting an update. Please see the vague error message below (Apologies it had changed before I could copy the message to my clipboard.

Some problems occurred during installation. Please Contact Support. (ERROR: 5 - Live Update Script does not match that on the Server...)

Some problems occurred during installation. Please Contact Support. (ERROR: 2 - Number of maximum retries for this update reached, skipping this update...)

My Approved Change Window is 10:00am to 15:00pm today. Please could I have some support in resolving this issue?

Kind Regards,
Conor","","","","Removed the error from the backend","","Alin Anca","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","","","1.0","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","Conor Lane","2025-01-08T10:12:10.000Z","2025-01-09T09:21:05.000Z"
