Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

Currently the hotfix update still appears in the list of ""Available EPP Software Updates"" even after it was already applied.   Please be assured that the hotfix is successfully applied to the EPP appliance and no further action is required on your behalf.  You may ignore this list under ""Available EPP Software Updates"", this will be removed after applying the upgrade to v5.9.4.0.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards
