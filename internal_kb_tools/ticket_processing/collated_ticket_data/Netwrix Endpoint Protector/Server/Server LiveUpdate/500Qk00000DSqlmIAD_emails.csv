Hi David,

In order to have SSH access I will reach out to our legal department and they will provide a document that you must review and sign.
Once I return the signed document I will be notified and we will set a remote session where I can provide the offline patch that will create the account in the backend.
After that, we are done.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi David, Kirill,

I apologize for the delayed follow up on this,

We finally have a way to enable a separate SSH account for your team, without having to request control of the screen in a remote session.

It will be done through uploading an offline patch in the UI.

My colleague Eduard will get back to you shortly to let you know the next steps for this process.

Thank you and best regards,

HI David,

In order to create an SSH account for you, we would still need SSH access, to enable your SSH account.

We are currently checking internally on how we could achieve that without having to connect SSH and we will get back to you as soon as we have an update.

Thank you and best regards,
