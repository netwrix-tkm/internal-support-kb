Despite our customer having applied the ""Security Update - Epp Server Hotfix #1.1"" update, it still appears as if it hasn't been completed in the update screen. The updates were successfully completed, and the server was restarted, but when we check the Live Update area, we encounter the update prompt again. How can we resolve this issue?

Best Regards.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","NONE","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Laykon Distributor","Faruk SarÄ±","2024-07-18T06:28:51.000Z","2024-07-18T07:16:15.000Z"
