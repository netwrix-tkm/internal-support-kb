I have checked the logs.There is an issue on the server side, the EPP client does not receive any URL whitelists. That's why it is not applying them.
There was a similar report in other in support, check the linked ADO item. I left some comments there also, maybe if the customer selects the whitelist one more time it will work. I think that first selection enables it, but it can't be seen anywhere and a second selection of it in fact deselects it. 


@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan as I mentioned in the linked item also, we should test this properly inhouse and provide a workaround, if possible, until we get it fixed properly.

@WaitingOnEngineer 


After upgrading to EPP Server version 5.9.4.0, customers who use Allowlists for ""Allowed Files"" and ""Deep Packet Inspection"" may encounter an issue when editing existing CAP policies containing these components. Specifically, when entering edit mode for such a policy, the previously checked components ""Allowed Files"" and/or ""Deep Packet Inspection"" will not be listed on the display of CAP policy configuration. Consequently, if the user clicks the SAVE button, the policy will be saved without these components.

This bug will be fixed in the next release of EPP Server.


Available workaround:

If a customer needs to edit an existing CAP policy containing allowlists for ""Allowed Files"" and/or ""Deep Packet Inspection"" they must re-check all desired ""Allowed Files"" and/or ""Deep Packet Inspection"" components before clicking the SAVE option. By doing so, these components will be included in the edited CAP policy.

Support team: Please also refer to Backend Procedure no. 65. 5940 Allowlists for ""Allowed Files"" and ""Deep Packet Inspection"" issue when editing CAP policy

Customer reached out to request a detailed root cause analysis regarding a recent issue we encountered with an EPP server version update. Due to this issue, the CAP policy did not select Deep Packet Inspection Dictionary, and it is important for us to understand the root cause in order to address and prevent future incidents.

After updating to the new EPP server version, we have experienced significant disruptions in service. This has affected more than 1000+ users system performance and user accessibility.

This incident has been reported to our incident management team for compliance purpose . So we need the root cause of this.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-08-23T12:56:01.000Z","2024-08-23T12:56:01.000Z","false","false"
