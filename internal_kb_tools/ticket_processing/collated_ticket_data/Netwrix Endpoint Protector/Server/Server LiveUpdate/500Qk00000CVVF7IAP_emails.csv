Thank you for your email.
This is a known issue currently- and we are investigating it.
For the time being, you can disregard the upgrade.
For some reason, even if applied, the update does not go away from the queue, and can even be applied multiple

Hi,

okay thanks for the answer.
Another problem which we have is that the newest client version we can push is 6.2.2.1. Normally it should be the 6.2.2.2 right?
Is it also a known issue?

Yes, of sorts- so the Vulnerability upgradation, comes in two stages.
1- Server upgrade- which you already applied- but it still lingers on
2-CLients upgrade- I will leave the links here for them as well. This is not a bug- the hickup is that the clients upgrade were not injected in the #1 fix,
but we are looking into perhapse injecting them all together.

Hi,

okay thanks for the answer.
Another problem which we have is that the newest client version we can push is 6.2.2.1. Normally it should be the 6.2.2.2 right?
Is it also a known issue?

Hi Marius,

Thank you for your email.
As far as the updates go- it seems that the lingering patch issue will be addressed in the future server release version- so 5.9.4.0.
It would seem that this was a feature, and not a bug.
As for the clients being downloadable from the UI, there are no current updates on this.

Hi Marius,

1- Server upgrade- which you already applied- but it still lingers on
2-CLients upgrade- I will leave the links here for them as well. This is not a bug- the hickup is that the clients upgrade were not injected in the #1 fix,
but we are looking into perhapse injecting them all together.

Hello,
one last question, all of our clients Are now on the version 6.2.2.1. Are we safe or do we have to manually install on all clients the version 6.2.2.2?
This would be a lot of work for us. An automatically installation would be way easier.
