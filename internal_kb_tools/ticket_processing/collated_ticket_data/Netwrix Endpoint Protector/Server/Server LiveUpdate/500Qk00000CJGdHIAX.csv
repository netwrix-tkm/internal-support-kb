"500Qk00000CJGdHIAX","00413046","Support Ticket","Live Updates not applying","Hello,

we had this issue in the past. So we are able to see available backend updates, but when we click on ""Apply Backend Updates"" nothing happens. I am not sure if they actually get installed or what is happening exactly.
The last time the support had a look at the server via SSH and told me that it looked like a update service wasn't running correctly and this was the issue. I don't know if it is the same issue this time.
PS: We have a remote session with the support today because of an other issue - maybe the support can have a look at this problem also then.

Thank you in advance!

Best regards!","","","","No action needed now","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server LiveUpdate","","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Geislinger GmbH","","2024-06-26T07:48:15.000Z","2024-06-26T11:40:53.000Z"
