Thank you for your email.
I understood that you had this session today, but there was no mention of the backend security updates aspect.
Since last time, did you update the server version?
If not, this should not be a problem, since the updates were applied last time as far as I could check the notes.
If you upgraded the server version, and the updates are not applying, we might need to have a call about it.

Hello,

sorry I totally forgot to mention it in today's meeting.
If I remember correctly - after the last occurrence of the problem we didn't upgrade the server version.
We applied backend updates a few times without any problem, but now these updates are listed here and won't go away.

Thank you for your email.
If not absolutely needed(perhaps take a look through them, and if nothing is mandatory)leave them as they are,
at least for now.
Because as seen, they can become conflictual so unless absolutely required, you may skip them.
