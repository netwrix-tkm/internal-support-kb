I'm writing to inquire about the configuration of the Endpoint Protector administrator webpage. Currently, the webpage is accessible at <a href='https://epp.kms-technology.com/.' target='_blank'>https://epp.kms-technology.com/.</a> Is it possible to modify the URL to <a href='https://epp.kms-technology.com' target='_blank'>https://epp.kms-technology.com</a>:4443 ?
Regards,
Xuan","","","","Customer says that the logs are fewer ( It seems that the issue is resolved ) and requested Netwrix Support to close the case.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","82.4","Closed - Resolved","KMS-Technology","Xuan Nguyen","2024-09-13T03:37:18.000Z","2024-12-04T13:18:47.000Z"
