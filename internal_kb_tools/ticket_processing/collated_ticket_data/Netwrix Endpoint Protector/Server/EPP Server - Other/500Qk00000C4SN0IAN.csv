Is there any way to generate a report or to have a view of users that have custom settings different than the global settings that they should inherit? We have noticed a bug within the EPP server in which when you activate the debug logging setting, the Intercept VPN Traffic option goes to Off. We would like to find out which users have settings which are not currently aligned with the Global Settings without manually having to verify each user.

Thank you.","","","","Customer confirmed that case can be closed.
