I'm attempting to apply EPP Server 5.9.3.0 and EPP Server Hotfix 1.1 to my EPP appliance. Although I receive a notification indicating the update was successful, I am still prompted to download and install the updates when I check for updates again.

Could you please advise on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you,
Giancarlo","","","","hotfix was applied","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","41.9","Closed - Resolved","Disney Streaming Technology","Giancarlo Alberti","2024-07-23T17:59:17.000Z","2024-09-03T14:32:26.000Z"
