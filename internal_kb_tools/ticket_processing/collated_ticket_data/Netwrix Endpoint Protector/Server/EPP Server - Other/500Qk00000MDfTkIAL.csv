I just setup a new GCP image of EPP server (staging environment) and now looking to get the UI up and running. Can we setup a call tomorrow anytime between 12 -2 pm pst to get this done on the backend ? 

Reg,
Bharani","","The staging server looked okay. When we tried to access the EPP server via IP and not DNS it worked. I believe the issue is with the DNS here.
We upgraded the Staging EPP server from 5810 to 5941. We also migrated with System Backup V2 the Prod server to the new Staging server.

Regarding the Certificates, you will need a body and a .key certificate to upload in Appliance -> Server Maintenance.","Waiting on customer to confirm we can close and that everything is okay.","The staging server looked okay.
