Do you know if this issue occurred again for the customer?
The the issue could be caused because the license was probably released from the computer but a set of logs from one of the computers where the issue occurs would help with the investigation.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Danylo,

I am trying to check this with the engineers today. 
If the computer was unlicensed, then I believe it was expected behavior. But I will have to double check and let you know the exact answer.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Customer already has an Automatic License Release option enabled.
So, when EPP client on the computer started to use ""Block only"" policy action instead of ""Remediation"" is this unexpected behavior?

Hello Danylo,

If there are no licenses available, the unlicensed computers will no longer be able to communicate with the EPP server.
The unlicensed computers might not be applying any policies if the EPP Client was not communicating with the server at allo.
If the EPP Client already received the policies from the server before the license was released by the EPP Server, they might stop applying the policies after a period of time.

I would recommend to enable the Automatic License Release feature from System Configuration -> System Licensing -> View Licenses -> Scroll down to the bottom of the page -> Automatic License Release.
This way the customer can release the licenses from the computers which did not check in with the server for a specific amount of time. 

Let me know if this feature is already in place.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello,

I think we can close this ticket now.
Customer does not have a lack of licenses currently.
Thank you!
