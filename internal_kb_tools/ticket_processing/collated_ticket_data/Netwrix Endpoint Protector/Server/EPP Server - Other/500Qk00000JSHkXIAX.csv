We encountered a technical issue with our lab servers, which made it impossible to access the previous EPP server. As a result, we installed a new EPP server, which has been operating under a trial license.

We have already requested an NFR license, but it is taking longer than expected to process. Since the trial license is set to expire today, we kindly request an extension of the trial license for an additional month to ensure that our production environment remains unaffected.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,","","","","License extended.","","Andrei Pop","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2024-12-13T05:49:17.000Z","2024-12-13T08:11:34.000Z"
