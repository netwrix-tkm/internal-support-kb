Our prospect, BMW China, is facing an issue where the AD structure is not being pulled.
Connection is successful. We tried with multiple users, multiple domain controllers, etc. 

We need to proceed with urgency in this case as they will take a decision by the end of the month and this is KO criteria. Please reach out to the customer and possibly schedule a remote session with someone from R&D or alternatively if there are some logs that might help from the server side let me know as i can try to get them for you. Currently ssh is not possible as possible firewall rule is blocking it but it will get resolved in the following days. Server version: 5942

Attaching screenshot of what is seen when saving the sync.

Regards,

Andreas","","17 April 2025
