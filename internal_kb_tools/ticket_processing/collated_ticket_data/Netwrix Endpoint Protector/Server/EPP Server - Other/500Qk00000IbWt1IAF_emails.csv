Thank you for getting back to us. 

Just to be sure I understand the issue that you are encountering, you downloaded the audit log backups and tried to archive them ? 

And that is generating a wrong rar file ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

When I choose more than 5 downloaded tar backups to the archive, the archive is in a random format. But if I select less than 5 (or 5) files, the archive comes in the ZIP format, please refer to the image below.

[cid:image001.png@01DB3CC5.71295680]

However, the archive with less than 5 files in a proper ZIP format is still unable to be extracted, refer to the below image.
[cid:image002.png@01DB3CC5.EBE10C60]


I remember this archiving was working when I took the backup last time.

Kindly look into this and let me know if I’m missing something here.

Thanks!

Dear Daniel,

When I have multiple files, I want them to be archived under single zip, I don’t want to download each file manually. The same was working earlier, I’m wondering why it is not working now.

Also, I can see they are already zipped, if you don’t expect me to zip all of them into one archive again, could you please help me to understand what is the purpose of that feature there?

Thanks!

The files must be downloaded manually from the EPP UI, then you can archive them. 

Can you share with us a short video with how you are archiving the tar.gz files and from where you are downloading them ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The files must be downloaded manually from the EPP UI, then you can archive them.

Can you share with us a short video with how you are archiving the tar.gz files and from where you are downloading them ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

When I have multiple files, I want them to be archived under single zip, I don’t want to download each file manually. The same was working earlier, I’m wondering why it is not working now.

Also, I can see they are already zipped, if you don’t expect me to zip all of them into one archive again, could you please help me to understand what is the purpose of that feature there?

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The files that you are trying to archive are already zipped, is there a reason for what you would like to archive them again?

Do you select the files one by one or you select them randomly ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

When I choose more than 5 downloaded tar backups to the archive, the archive is in a random format. But if I select less than 5 (or 5) files, the archive comes in the ZIP format, please refer to the image below.

[cid:image007.png@01DB4278.B97198E0]

However, the archive with less than 5 files in a proper ZIP format is still unable to be extracted, refer to the below image.
[cid:image008.png@01DB4278.B97198E0]


I remember this archiving was working when I took the backup last time.

Kindly look into this and let me know if I’m missing something here.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

Just to be sure I understand the issue that you are encountering, you downloaded the audit log backups and tried to archive them ?

And that is generating a wrong rar file ?

Looking forward for your response.
