Good day!
Can we check with you, for EPP, is there any documentation for HA?
As we understand whenever a device is connected to the server, it's connecting to it via server IP.

Which means at any point of time, only 1 of the server will be receiving the logs. Is there any way we can set it such that the servers are in HA, with the logs being duplicated to both of the server?

Due to compliance regulations, this HA configuration is required, hence we're checking with EPP on this prior to replying customer.

Thank you!
