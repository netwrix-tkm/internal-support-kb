Hello Ramon,

Not much to add beyond what i explained already:
- They had a server, incident literally burned the machine that had the
server and backups.
- Created a new server and the costumer remade all policies and
configuration.
- Since its a new server, the old license cannot be applied to this one.
- Can you please generate a new license for this server: IWPDIRG0

Best regards,
