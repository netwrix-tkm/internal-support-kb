1. To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

2. You can turn off the client notification in the CAP policy so the user won't receive notifications:


3. If you create a denylist for applications, they will be blocked from opening completely. You can prevent transfers in those apps by creating a Block & Report CAP policy and select those apps from Exit Points. This way they can still be used for communication, only transfers will be blocked:

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Thank you for your response. It seems we overthought Question 3...

Following up on Question 1, according to the user manual, when the report
exceeds 10,000 entries, it is possible to search using filters.

The current situation for the client is as follows:

   1. The MIS team has limited manpower.
   2. The company has set up multiple Groups.
   3. Each Group has its own manager, and *Manager A should not be able to
   view or manage Group B's data*.
   4. When an employee leaves the company, the manager checks the past six
   months of records in the system.

Based on the workflow, there are two key issues:
A. Before exporting to a CSV file, *how can Manager A view only logs
related to Group A*?
B. Is there a way to export CSV files separately based on Groups?
Thanks
Jay

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the additional details!
I checked, and unfortunately it's not possible to filter the logs by groups, and all EPP admins can see all logs.
Since they need to review the logs for ex employees, they can filter by their computer or username.

Hi Support
 

Yes, every admin has an EPP account.

Department administrators need to review the DC and CAP reports of former employees within 6 months.

Thanks
Jay

Hi Jay,

You're welcome!

By Managers, do you mean each of them has an admin account for the EPP server?
What type of report are you asking about? Logs reports?

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.


Thank you for your response. It seems we overthought Question 3...

Following up on Question 1, according to the user manual, when the report exceeds 10,000 entries, it is possible to search using filters.

The current situation for the client is as follows:


	The MIS team has limited manpower.
	The company has set up multiple Groups.
	Each Group has its own manager, and Manager A should not be able to view or manage Group B's data.
	When an employee leaves the company, the manager checks the past six months of records in the system.


Based on the workflow, there are two key issues:
A. Before exporting to a CSV file, how can Manager A view only logs related to Group A?
B. Is there a way to export CSV files separately based on Groups?


Thanks
Jay

Hello Jay,

Thanks for reaching out!

1. To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

2. You can turn off the client notification in the CAP policy so the user won't receive notifications:


3. If you create a denylist for applications, they will be blocked from opening completely. You can prevent transfers in those apps by creating a Block & Report CAP policy and select those apps from Exit Points. This way they can still be used for communication, only transfers will be blocked:

I have another question: why is ""Display Settings"" placed in Device Control

Some system-related settings are placed in Device Control. What is the
logic? (Asked by the customer ^0^)

The Display Settings is the only one that might seem out of place, but it's set up this way because the settings apply the same hierarchy as the permissions in device control, and therefore many are interdependent. Also, this is the menu that our customers have been accustomed to for many years.

Hello Jay,

Thanks for reaching out!

1. To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

2. You can turn off the client notification in the CAP policy so the user won't receive notifications:


3. If you create a denylist for applications, they will be blocked from opening completely. You can prevent transfers in those apps by creating a Block & Report CAP policy and select those apps from Exit Points. This way they can still be used for communication, only transfers will be blocked:
