If you are using Hyper-V Manager for hosting the EPP server image, then you will need Hyper-V Manager
(Windows Server 2016)  version 10.0.14393.0.

You will have to use one of the supported virtualization software I provided in my previous email.
For example, you may use Oracle VirtualBox which is a free and open source virtualization product for enterprise use.

Thank you and Best regards,
