I spoke to one of my colleagues and he said that he checked it immediately after the upgrade and it was working, but that does not seem to be the case anymore.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-06T02:28:16.000Z"

This functionality worked till they upgraded to 5.9.4.1. Also I tested on my end and a colleagues end on 5.9.4.1 and it worked on our ends. Screenshots attached in New Remote Session folder: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00437881

I saw in the backend of the customer that there was a file missing compared to a test server: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.http.nginx.conf","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-04-03T14:58:41.000Z"
