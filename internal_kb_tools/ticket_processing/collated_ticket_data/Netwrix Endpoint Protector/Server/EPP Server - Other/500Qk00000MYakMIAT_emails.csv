Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

We hope you are doing well.

Please let me know the below:
1. Is this only happening for 1 single end user or multiple ones?
2. Is it happening to the exact same end user that it previously happened?
3. Is the user duplicating or the computer? or both? for this end user.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this. They have provided us with a possible solution/workaround.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week and we will try and apply it.

Prerequisites:
- we will need access to the EPP server backend
- please uninstall the EPP agent on that computer before our remote session, after we run the procedure the agent can be re-installed.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

We would need ssh access to the backend. This is usually done through Putty or Terminal. Basically we would like to connect to the backend of the EPP server and take a look there.

Can you please also let me know if the EPP server is hosted on a VM, AWS, Azure or GCP platform?

Hi Ismail,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this. They have provided us with a possible solution/workaround.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week and we will try and apply it.

Prerequisites:
- we will need access to the EPP server backend
- please uninstall the EPP agent on that computer before our remote session, after we run the procedure the agent can be re-installed.

Hi Ismail,

Thank you! We will wait to hear back from you once the end user runs the commands.

Regarding the denylist issue, I have just sent an update on that ticket separately. Ticket number is: 00436527 - Denylist does not apply.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

We hope you are doing well.

Please let me know the below:
1. Is this only happening for 1 single end user or multiple ones?
2. Is it happening to the exact same end user that it previously happened?

Thank you!

If it is hosted in AWS, please open port 62828 for the IP of the computer from which we will connect(in the remote session). From that computer we will access the backend of the EPP server in AWS through Putty or Terminal.

We will wait to hear back from you next week.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

We would need ssh access to the backend. This is usually done through Putty or Terminal. Basically we would like to connect to the backend of the EPP server and take a look there.

Can you please also let me know if the EPP server is hosted on a VM, AWS, Azure or GCP platform?

Hi Ismail,

We would need ssh access to the backend. This is usually done through Putty or Terminal. Basically we would like to connect to the backend of the EPP server and take a look there.

Can you please also let me know if the EPP server is hosted on a VM, AWS, Azure or GCP platform?

Hi, what do you mean you need the epp server backend? Just access to the epp server, or what do you need me to do to make sure you have access to that?

Hi Ismail,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this. They have provided us with a possible solution/workaround.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week and we will try and apply it.

Prerequisites:
- we will need access to the EPP server backend
- please uninstall the EPP agent on that computer before our remote session, after we run the procedure the agent can be re-installed.

Hi Ismail,

Unfortunately we would need those logs to see why the computer gets duplicated on the EPP server.

The appended logs that will be created will persist through restarts, so you can run the first set of 4 commands on that computer and then let the end user continue with their work. you can check at the end of the day or in 2 days if there are more duplicates on the EPP server and if they are then run the second set of commands to gather the logs. You do not need to be constantly on that computer, just run the first set of 4 commands and only relog/remote on the computer once you see on the EPP UI that there are new duplicates.

It may take hours until it reproduces. Like yesterday there was 1, and now in the morning 3 more came up. I am not full time worker so I am not on the device all day too. Is this still the most effective way to do this?

Hi Ismail,

Please run the below commands on the affected computer. These commands will generate log files which will allow us to further investigate this issue/behavior.

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself a few times(wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

We hope you are doing well.

Please let me know the below:
1. Is this only happening for 1 single end user or multiple ones?
2. Is it happening to the exact same end user that it previously happened?
3. Is the user duplicating or the computer? or both? for this end user.
