Hello Serhat,

The logs will not collect any confidential information, it should only use the id's of the machines and licenses. 

Indeed, the query should solve this issue, as it did on our test and for other other customers where this issue also reproduced.
In our attempts to reproduce this issue, we usually had a few days as a time difference between the computers which are actually licensed and the ones which do not have a license assigned but they appear as licensed.
So we would like to collect the logs from your environment since on your server we could find computers without licenses which appear as licensed on the egde date. So we want to make sure that the license release is working as intended.

Let me know if we can have a 10 min session today at 15:00 NL time today in order to enable the logs.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil,

In the other 2 sessions and in this support ticket, we were told that running the queries would address the issue. Were you not able to reproduce the issue?
What kind of information will be collected in the logs, any personal data, etc will be included?  Can you also confirm this?

We can have the first session on Monday (30th) and the second session on Wednesday/Thursday (2nd/3rd). Sometime between 3pm - 5pm is fine.

Thanks,

Hello Serhat,

The engineers asked me to collect additional details by enabling log collection at server level for a 2 days.
Would it be possible to schedule two short remote sessions this week: first remote session in order enable the log collection at the server level and a second remote session, 2 days after the first session, in order to save the logs locally and disable the log collection process.

Hello Serhat,

I do have the query which has to be ran in order to correct the display issue. And this should permanently address the issue.
It is not a change that we do for this server in particular, we are just going to update the license status for the computers which do not have a license assigned and they still appear as licensed.

If you want to run the query we can do it in a remote session tomorrow.
Otherwise, let me know if we can have another remote session tomorrow in order to collect some more details regarding this issue from the EPP Server so the engineers can investigate further and address it.

Thank you,

Hi Emil,
When you are coming with the correct values for the sql query, please also check the cronjob and script, so that we can understand if it works, or check logs.
We need to understand what causes this, and if we do not confirm what the issue is, even though we fix the db, it will happen again for other computers.

From the logs that we collected, the engineers could find that for four computers the licenses were released while running the automatic license release script.
The engineers asked me to have another look in the server's database, at the ""computers"" table, for each of these four computer. They need me to take a screenshot with the details for each of the computers.

Please let me know if we could schedule a 15 min session for anytime it would work for you in order to collect this information.
