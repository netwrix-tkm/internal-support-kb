"500Qk00000G7D4AIAV","00421736","Support Ticket","[ATI-UHRI-EPP] Query for Virtualization platforms for CoSoSys","Hi Support,

Good day!
We understand EPP currently supports the following virtualization platforms
- VSphere
- Virtualbox
- Windows Hyper-V

We have just ended a meeting with a customer, and they intend to use Proxmax VE in the near future, can we check with you guys if this is supported? 

If it is not supported, may we know if there are plans to support this virtualization platform in the future? If yes, may we know what is the timeline for this?

Thank you!
