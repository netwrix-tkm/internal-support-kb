Hi Pat,

I will connect from my work machine, would it be enough if I provide you my public IP?

Hi,
If you can narrow down the IP range from where you are coming, I will get a firewall rule put in for Tuesday. I think we allow {liveupdate|cloud}.endpintprotector.com inbound right now to 80|443.

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately without SSH access we can't change the port for the UI.
can you check internally if an exception can be made just for one single remote session so we can implement the procedure?

Hi,
Tuesday @ 1pm sounds fine. When you say “remote session” can you do this without any effort by me? Aka, the server is not on the internet so SSH and sch will fail miserably.

Hi Pat,

Thanks for reaching out!
It is possible to change the GUI port, but we need to schedule a remote session for this.
Are you available this Friday or next week?

Hi,
We do routine Firewall changes early Tuesday and Thursday mornings so they complete before business hours. Making a change outside that window requires a senior VP or CIO approval. How about you tell me today or Monday?  It doesn’t have to be exact, it can be a subnet, just not too big.
We’re hesitant to open a widely brute-forced port to the entire internet because we haven’t done any security analysis on it.

Hi Pat,

Thanks for reaching out!
It is possible to change the GUI port, but we need to schedule a remote session for this.
Are you available this Friday or next week?

Hi, again,
We could also just open the remote zoomy session and I can type the commands in. It’s only a nginx config, I bet. Nothing like dealing with my 35 systems in AWS or the 15 network scanners and SIEM I have to sysadmin. :)

Hi,
We do routine Firewall changes early Tuesday and Thursday mornings so they complete before business hours. Making a change outside that window requires a senior VP or CIO approval. How about you tell me today or Monday?  It doesn’t have to be exact, it can be a subnet, just not too big.
We’re hesitant to open a widely brute-forced port to the entire internet because we haven’t done any security analysis on it.

Hi,
If you can narrow down the IP range from where you are coming, I will get a firewall rule put in for Tuesday. I think we allow {liveupdate|cloud}.endpintprotector.com inbound right now to 80|443.

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately without SSH access we can't change the port for the UI.
can you check internally if an exception can be made just for one single remote session so we can implement the procedure?

Hi,
Tuesday @ 1pm sounds fine. When you say “remote session” can you do this without any effort by me? Aka, the server is not on the internet so SSH and sch will fail miserably.

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately the SSH credentials for the EPP Server backend are not shared with the customers. That can be done only upon the customer signing an NDA and Product approval and for this purpose there is a good chance it will not be approved. Is there any way you can make a one-time exception for this and allow us to take control in the remote session? Everything we will perform on the server will be explained and you can of course see everything we do.

Hi, again,

We could also just open the remote zoomy session and I can type the commands in. It’s only a nginx config, I bet. Nothing like dealing with my 35 systems in AWS or the 15 network scanners and SIEM I have to sysadmin. :)

Hi,

We do routine Firewall changes early Tuesday and Thursday mornings so they complete before business hours. Making a change outside that window requires a senior VP or CIO approval. How about you tell me today or Monday?  It doesn’t have to be exact, it can be a subnet, just not too big.

We’re hesitant to open a widely brute-forced port to the entire internet because we haven’t done any security analysis on it.

 

Pat

Hi Pat,

I will send you my IP on Tuesday in case it changes.
I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.

Hi,

If you can narrow down the IP range from where you are coming, I will get a firewall rule put in for Tuesday. I think we allow {liveupdate|cloud}.endpintprotector.com inbound right now to 80|443.

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately without SSH access we can't change the port for the UI.
can you check internally if an exception can be made just for one single remote session so we can implement the procedure?

Hi,

Tuesday @ 1pm sounds fine. When you say “remote session” can you do this without any effort by me? Aka, the server is not on the internet so SSH and sch will fail miserably.

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately the SSH credentials for the EPP Server backend are not shared with the customers. That can be done only upon the customer signing an NDA and Product approval and for this purpose there is a good chance it will not be approved. Is there any way you can make a one-time exception for this and allow us to take control in the remote session? Everything we will perform on the server will be explained and you can of course see everything we do.

Hi,

We do routine Firewall changes early Tuesday and Thursday mornings so they complete before business hours. Making a change outside that window requires a senior VP or CIO approval. How about you tell me today or Monday?  It doesn’t have to be exact, it can be a subnet, just not too big.

We’re hesitant to open a widely brute-forced port to the entire internet because we haven’t done any security analysis on it.

 

Pat

Hi Pat,

I will send you my IP on Tuesday in case it changes.
I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.

Hi Pat,

I will connect from my work machine, would it be enough if I provide you my public IP?

Hi,

If you can narrow down the IP range from where you are coming, I will get a firewall rule put in for Tuesday. I think we allow {liveupdate|cloud}.endpintprotector.com inbound right now to 80|443.

 

Pat

Hi Pat,

Unfortunately without SSH access we can't change the port for the UI.
can you check internally if an exception can be made just for one single remote session so we can implement the procedure?

Hi,

Tuesday @ 1pm sounds fine. When you say “remote session” can you do this without any effort by me? Aka, the server is not on the internet so SSH and sch will fail miserably.

 

Pat

Hi Pat,

Does 1:00pm on Tuesday work for you?
If not, let me know when you're available.

Hi,

This week is a mess. Next week is better. Can we do this on Tuesday or Thursday? Both of those days are pretty open right now. I’m east coast US (EDT).

 

Pat

Hi Pat,

Thanks for reaching out!
It is possible to change the GUI port, but we need to schedule a remote session for this.
Are you available this Friday or next week?
