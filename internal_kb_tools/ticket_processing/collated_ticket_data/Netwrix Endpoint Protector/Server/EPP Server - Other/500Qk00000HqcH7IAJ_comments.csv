@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi,

There isn't a way to generate the export from the backend.
Improvements to Export entities functionality were done in version 5.9.4.0 so we recommend a server upgrade.

@WaitingOnEngineer

As Alina stated on previous comment this issue were already addressed in 5.9.4.1. 
However as we know ServiceNow is already struggling with performance issue due to log processing & disk space. We strongly recommend to coordinate further EPP Server upgrade with giving the time for server to process current log backlog first.

    3. Delete old exports that did not finalize:

   DELETE FROM export_entities WHERE export_status=0;

   4. Enable debugging for the export cron:


--- CODE ---
              touch /tmp/export_entities.debug
              touch /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
              chmod 777 /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
--- CODE ---

   5. Run a onetime computers export, wait 10-15 minutes and provide the debug file /var/log/epp/export_entities.log

   6. Disable the debugging:

--- CODE ---
               rm /tmp/export_entities.debug
--- CODE ---

   7. Recreate the Scheduled exports 

   8. Is there a sync job (Entra or Microsoft AD) running at this moment?

    2. Delete all scheduled exports (they can be recreated at the end of this test)
     All the scheduled exports were removed
 
    3. Delete old exports that did not finalize:
     All the old exports which were not finalized were removed

   4. Enable debugging for the export cron:
     The debugging was enabled

   5. Run a onetime computers export, wait 10-15 minutes and provide the debug file /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
     I ran the one time export and waited about 30 minutes but no logs were written in the export_entities.log file
     Also I let the one time export to run a few more days, but the export_entities.log file was still empty and no export was generated.

   6. Disable the debugging:
    The debugging is still enabled, hoping to log something

   7. Recreate the Scheduled exports 
    Currently there are no scheduled exports needed, so we only have the one time export still running

   8. Is there a sync job (Entra or Microsoft AD) running at this moment?
    No Sync Job running at the moment","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-02-25T10:03:10.000Z","2025-02-25T10:03:10.000Z","false","false"

Hi Emil,

Thank you for the link. The EscalationAttachmentFolder in the ADO task has a different link(../Data/00425874), that's why I wasn't able to see anything.

I noticed that the debug log file was not created in the correct path and that is why it is empty.
The correct path is 
           /var/log/epp/export_entities.log 
     

Please redo the test:


	 - 	Delete already created exports that have not finished:


--- CODE ---
                DELETE FROM export_entities WHERE export_status=0;
--- CODE ---

     2. Enable debugging for the export cron with the correct path:

--- CODE ---
              touch /tmp/export_entities.debug
              touch /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
              chmod 777 /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
--- CODE ---

      3. Run a onetime export of Users. 
          I noticed there are fewer users , so first test the users export and if the users export is working test the onetime computers export next.

      4. While you wait for the export,  run this mysql query a few times and provide screenshots:


--- CODE ---
              show full processlist;
--- CODE ---

       5. Provide the debug file /var/log/epp/export_entities.log


       6. Disable the debugging:

               rm /tmp/export_entities.debug

Ask the customer if it is possible that he filters and deletes some of the entities (computers, users) that he thinks are not needed. 
I see that there are some computers that do not have a user assigned or users that have not been assigned to any computer.

Regards,
Alina

@WaitingOnEngineer

Based on provided by DEV's command, please execute it, it should help cleanup DB, and with 5941 patch version, export should work. 
No customer-facing DEV's exposure will be provided.
