Unfortunately, due to the departure of an employee, we are no longer able to access the Endpoint Protector Portal.
This is the version hosted by you with the URL: <a href='https://4ehl15d.hosted.endpointprotector.com/' target='_blank'>4ehl15d.hosted.endpointprotector.com/</a>
Can you reset the password for the Root user? Or is there a way I can do it myself?","","","","Password reset for the root account","","Alin Anca","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","3.3","Closed - Resolved","Hogrefe-Verlag GmbH & Co.
