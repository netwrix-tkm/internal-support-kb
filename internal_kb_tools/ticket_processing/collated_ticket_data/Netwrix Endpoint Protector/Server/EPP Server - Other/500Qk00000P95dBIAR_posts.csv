Our customer is once again not receiving email alerts from their EPP server for the Device Control and Content Aware Report. Could we schedule a remote session to investigate this issue further?

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

16-05 In the meeting we have tried to check the issue that is caused by the EPP alerts .
We have requested the access to the hosted EPP server and reschedule the meeting for Monday at 14:00 Jakarta time. 


19-05 In the meeting we have cleared the mailer from the backend of the EPP server and restarted the services. 

As we agreed you will check with the customer if they still encounter issues with the future alerts, so we can investigate this further.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-05-19T07:59:02.000Z"

23-05 In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps that helped us to solve your issue:
-verified if the test email is received and we confirmed that it is
-verified the alerts how they are configured and when was the last one that was sent and received
-we have stopped the services from the backend of the server
-we clean the unprocessed logs and the alerts that were not sent
-we found that the folders responsible for the temporary cache were not correctly created so we recreated them, which leads us to the fix of the issue.Â 

What we can recommend for you in the future is to correct the alerts and make them more granularly so they can send email alerts for the computers / events that you would like to monitor more closely.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-05-23T10:24:55.000Z"
