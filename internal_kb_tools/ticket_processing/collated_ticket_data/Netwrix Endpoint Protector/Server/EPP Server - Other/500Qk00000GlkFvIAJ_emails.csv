Hi,

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We will need to provide the end customer with the EPP image compatible for Azure.  They will need to provide us the the access keys to a container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

Please follow the step by step deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/MicrosoftAzure.htm

I have also attached the guide in this email.

Hi,

 

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

[cid:image001.png@01DB3CD0.C2062B90]


Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

[cid:image002.png@01DB3CD0.C2062B90]


Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

Hi,

 

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

 



 

 

Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

 



 

 

Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

 



 

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

 



 

Best regards

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:


	Launching VM for Azure Deployment
	Creating the Disk
	Creating the Virtual Machine




Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

 

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

 

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

 



 

 

Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

 



 

 

Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

 



 

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:


	Launching VM for Azure Deployment
	Creating the Disk
	Creating the Virtual Machine




Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

 

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Thank you for the URL.  I was on medical leave and out of office the past two days, I have made the request internally to our DevOps team to provide the EPP Image.

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We will need to provide the end customer with the EPP image compatible for Azure.  They will need to provide us the the access keys to a container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

Please follow the step by step deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/MicrosoftAzure.htm

I have also attached the guide in this email.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.

Hi,

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

 

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

 



 

 

Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

 



 

 

Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

 



 

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

 



 

Best regards

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:


	Launching VM for Azure Deployment
	Creating the Disk
	Creating the Virtual Machine




Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We will need to provide the end customer with the EPP image compatible for Azure.  They will need to provide us the the access keys to a container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

Please follow the step by step deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/MicrosoftAzure.htm

I have also attached the guide in this email.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.

Hi,

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

[cid:image002.png@01DB40DB.A8D1D160]


Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

[cid:image003.png@01DB40DB.A8D1D160]


Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

[cid:image004.png@01DB40DB.A8D1D160]

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

[cid:image005.png@01DB40DB.A8D1D160]

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:

  1.  Launching VM for Azure Deployment
  2.  Creating the Disk
  3.  Creating the Virtual Machine
[cid:image006.png@01DB40DB.A8D1D160]

Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

 

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

 



 

 

Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

 



 

 

Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

 



 

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

 



 

Best regards

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:


	Launching VM for Azure Deployment
	Creating the Disk
	Creating the Virtual Machine




Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

 

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hi,

The internet problem at our business partner has been fixed. Modules are active. We installed the agent and it appears online.

Our only problem for now is that the Snapshot of the server cannot be taken. Is it related to the ""Agent Status Not Ready"" warning?


[cid:image001.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]

Is it because it is the Virtual Machine being deployed? Because it is not selected here. Which one should we choose?

Hi,

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

[cid:image004.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]


Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

[cid:image005.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]


Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

[cid:image006.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

[cid:image007.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:

  1.  Launching VM for Azure Deployment
  2.  Creating the Disk
  3.  Creating the Virtual Machine
[cid:image008.png@01DB44D0.AEC6C4B0]

Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We will need to provide the end customer with the EPP image compatible for Azure.  They will need to provide us the the access keys to a container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

Please follow the step by step deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/MicrosoftAzure.htm

I have also attached the guide in this email.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.

Thank you for the update on this. 

Our DevOps team specializes in these type of issues that relates to deployment of Endpoint Protector on hosted platforms.  I have submitted this case to our DevOps team to advise however there is a little delay as our Romanian team was off yesterday and is off today as well due to national holidays in Romania.  Please allow us until tomorrow to get some feedback internally and advise on the next steps to take in order to create the snapshots.

Hi,

 

The internet problem at our business partner has been fixed. Modules are active. We installed the agent and it appears online.

 

Our only problem for now is that the Snapshot of the server cannot be taken. Is it related to the “Agent Status Not Ready” warning?

 

 



 

Is it because it is the Virtual Machine being deployed? Because it is not selected here. Which one should we choose?

Hi,

 

The procedures you mentioned have been followed. We can access the interface again, but the server cannot access the internet. Therefore, the modules could not be activated. Although we changed the DNS settings, we could not fix the problem.

 



 

 

Inbount and Outbount settings are as follows;

 



 

 

Custom DNS was tried but to no avail.

 



 

Also, when we want to get a backup or Restore Point from Azure, we get an error;

 



 

Best regards

Hi Yunus,

After consulting internally about the situation with your newly deployed EPP Server Appliance, we would recommend that you re-deploy the EPP appliance from the image that we provided you on the Azure account.  Please follow the steps closely as instructed in the Azure Deployment guide.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/AzureDeployment.htm

Please follow the steps listed in the three sections:


	Launching VM for Azure Deployment
	Creating the Disk
	Creating the Virtual Machine




Please let me know the outcome after completing the re-deployment.

Kind regards

Hi,

 

Our client uploaded it. We accessed it from the web interface. When I wanted to start it as a trial, it said no internet. Therefore, we entered the DNS definition of 8.8.8.8.8. After that, internet access came to the server. We started it as a Trial. Then we lost access to the web interface. We restarted the server but we cannot access the interface in any way. However, in the command line we see that the machine is on and accessible. Can you help us?

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We will need to provide the end customer with the EPP image compatible for Azure.  They will need to provide us the the access keys to a container specifically created for the Endpoint Protector Virtual Machine.

Please follow the step by step deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Configuration/Azure/MicrosoftAzure.htm

I have also attached the guide in this email.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.
