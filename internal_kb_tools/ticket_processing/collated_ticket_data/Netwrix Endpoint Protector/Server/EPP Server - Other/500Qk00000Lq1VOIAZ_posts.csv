We have installed the EPP server on an Oracle VM running on Ubuntu. However, we are unable to activate the Content-Aware module. The internet connection on the Ubuntu system is working properly. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-13T09:20:00.000Z"

Please contact the Endpoint Protector Support team''.
Asked the client to provide some screenshots of their license and the server info.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-02-14T12:13:06.000Z"

As of now the issue is fixed.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-02-14T12:14:15.000Z"
