Hi,

On EPP 5.9.4.0 a new validator was added for the Administrator Phone Number input, because on EPP 5.9.3.0 this input did not have a proper validation. With the new validator the  Administrator Phone Number input accepts only digits.
On EPP 5.9.4.1 the validator for  Administrator Phone Number input is modified and it will accept the following format (000) 000-0000 as well.
