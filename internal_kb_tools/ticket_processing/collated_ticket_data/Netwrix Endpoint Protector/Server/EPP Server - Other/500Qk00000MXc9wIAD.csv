Our 2 x on-prem servers need their admin portal certificates renewing - expire 23/3/25.

We have new certificates issued by our external CA, how do we apply the certs, do you guys have to SSH into the boxes to renew the certs?

Regards
Peter","","We have provided the steps for updating the server certificate using the UI.
