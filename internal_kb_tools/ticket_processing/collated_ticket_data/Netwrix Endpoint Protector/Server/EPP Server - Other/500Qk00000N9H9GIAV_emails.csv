Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.
techsupport     Office 365      agshealth.com
Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.

Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

=09=09=09=09=09=09How to Fix It
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has create=
d a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions=
, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Check the text above for a custom message from the ema=
il admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you mig=
ht be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the messa=
ge or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient =
to deliver your message.
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the prob=
lem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to=
 discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if=
 you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance=
 for how to do so.

=09=09
=09=09
=09=09=09Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR
=09=09=09
=09=09=09This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicroso=
ft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's me=
ssage.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer v=
iolates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possibl=
e that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, an=
d only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although=
 it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the=
 admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

=09=09=09=09=09=09How to Fix It
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has create=
d a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions=
, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09Check the text above for a custom message from the ema=
il admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you mig=
ht be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the messa=
ge or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient =
to deliver your message.
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09
=09=09=09=09=09=09If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the prob=
lem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to=
discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if=
you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance=
for how to do so.

=09=09
=09=09
=09=09=09Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR
=09=09=09
=09=09=09This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicroso=
ft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's me=
ssage.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer v=
iolates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possibl=
e that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, an=
d only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although=
it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the=
admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule.

Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.
techsupport     Office 365      agshealth.com
Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

			Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR
			
			This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.
			
			In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

			Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
			
		
		
			
			A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
			
		
		
			
			You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.

						How to Fix It
						
					
					
						
						An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.
						
					
					
						
						·        Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.
						
					
					
						
						If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.
						
					
				
			
			
		
		
			
			 
			
		
		
			
			
			
			
		
		
			
			
			More Info for Email Admins
			
		
		
			
			Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR
			
			This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.
			
			In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.

Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Your message to ranganadhan.venkatesh@agshealth.com couldn't be delivered.
A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.
You are not allowed to send Emails to this AGSHealth user.
techsupport     Office 365      agshealth.com
Sender          Action Required
Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

We noticed in your previous screenshot that you're on server version 5.9.4.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version, 5.9.4.1, from Dashboard -> Live Update.
After upgrading the server, please update the clients as well.

Is this happening with only one user or several?

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.
Are you available now so we can take a look?

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Blocked by mail flow rule

How to Fix It
An email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

  *   Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at agshealthltd.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.
Are you available now so we can take a look?

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

We noticed in your previous screenshot that you're on server version 5.9.4.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version, 5.9.4.1, from Dashboard -> Live Update.
After upgrading the server, please update the clients as well.

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

We noticed in your previous screenshot that you're on server version 5.9.4.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version, 5.9.4.1, from Dashboard -> Live Update.

Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.
Are you available now so we can take a look?

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Is this happening with only one user or several?

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

We noticed in your previous screenshot that you're on server version 5.9.4.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version, 5.9.4.1, from Dashboard -> Live Update.
After upgrading the server, please update the clients as well.

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Is this happening with only one user or several?

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Best regards,
Alin Anca

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Thank you for your reply.
The difference regarding Date/Time between Server and Client time is justifiable as the server time is set to a different time zone as the time that is set on the computer which has the client installed.
As confirmed, we will close this ticket now

Have a nice day,

Hello,

Thank you fro your time today.
We have managed to change the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.
Also, we triggered a CAP policy, the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly, generating a log in the Content Aware Report.
Please check the configuration that the SIEM server has and in which scenarios it is sending the incidents violation reports to you over the email.

Hi Palvannan,

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Palvannan,

Please let me know after you checked.

If the server is hosted on your end, I can't connect to it, only during a remote session.
Are you available now so we can take a look?

Hi Palvannan,

The time mismatch cis probably because your server's time is set to New York, and the client is probably located in India, hence the 9.5 hours difference between the two.
Because the server time can differ from the client time, we always recommend checking the client's time when viewing the logs.

The 5.9.4.1 server version is a maintenance one, it only has small fixes and improvements, so we don't have a fix list for it, but we always recommend using the latest server and client.

Hi Palvannan,

Is this happening with only one user or several?
Is it possible that the user is in a different timezone?
