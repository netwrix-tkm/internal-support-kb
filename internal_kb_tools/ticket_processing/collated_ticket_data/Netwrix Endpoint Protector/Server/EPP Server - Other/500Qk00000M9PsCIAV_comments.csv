Hello,

The error returned by API is correct given the fact that the items used for filtering accept multiple selections.
For the query to work the request needs to be like : 


--- CODE ---/api/logs/device-control?limit=10&page=1&direction=DESC&filter_by[device_type_id][]=1,
--- CODE ---

 meaning for parameters that accept multiple selections before, ""="" ""[ ]"" is needed, also the correct parameter for device_type is device_type_id.

For this specific query the parameters that accept multiple selections are: 

	 - 	event_id,  
	 - 	machine_name,  
	 - 	device_name,  
	 - 	client_name and  
	 - 	device_type_id.

With the provided information some of the filters works now and I can export the required information via API

 Unfortunately, the filter with VID = 0 or  PID = 0 does not work.

&filter_by[vid][]=0 à Bad Request

&filter_by[vid]=0 à contains values with vid e. g. B0E

 Can you also check and adjust your API documentation. some of the values has been copied from the example and don’t work, please see the screenshots ""API filter not working 1"", ""API filter not working 2"", ""API filter not working 3"".","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-02-25T14:33:36.000Z","2025-02-25T14:33:36.000Z","false","false"

For the first filter VID is not a field that supports multiple selections, in my last comment there are the fields that support multiple selections. 



For the second filter VID=0 and PID=0, the filter retrieves all items that contain the filled in value.
For the errors presented in the attaches images, fields that accept multiple selections were used this means that the query needs to be like: 

--- CODE ---
/api/logs/device-control?limit=10&page=1&direction=DESC&filter_by[machine_name][]=MY_Computer_name
--- CODE ---



--- CODE ---/api/logs/device-control?limit=10&page=1&direction=DESC&filter_by[device_name][]=MY_Device_name
--- CODE ---

Please notice the square brackets at the end of the parameter and use them after each parameter that allows multiple selection.
