Customer name is PrivatBank.
Recently, Ukraine changed time zone to GMT+2 and now all time on the EPP server is seems like GMT+3.
For example, the current time is 12:43, but on the server last seen 13:43.
Could we please schedule the remote session to correct the server time?","","","","Ticket will be closed as per customer confirmation.","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","3.1","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","Danylo Didenko","2024-10-28T10:47:26.000Z","2024-10-31T13:52:40.000Z"
