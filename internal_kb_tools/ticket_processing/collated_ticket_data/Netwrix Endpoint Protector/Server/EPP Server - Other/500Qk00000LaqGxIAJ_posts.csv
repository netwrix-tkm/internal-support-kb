We have the latest server version 5.9.4.1. Tried to go to File Maintenance -> Shadow Files and delete those files. Web interface is freezing and no files are deleted. Tried to delete them bulk and one by one and still not working.

Files are stored locally on the server.

Thanks.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-07T08:16:39.000Z"

The behavior that the endpoint clients exhibit is very strange.
Within the EPP client notifier windows it shows no EPP Server IP address or hostname while at the same time it shows connected with recent time stamps. In the epp client logs the hostname and ip address of the server is there but not displayed within the EPP client.

In our remote session we uninstalled the previous client (6.2.3.1006) restarted the system, then installed the new client (v6.2.4.2), we used the setserver ip tool in attempt to manually set the EPP Server IP address and hostname.
I even did a re-register of the endpoint client but none of the actions helped in resolving the issue. Under Device Control > Computers it shows that the epp client is Licensed and Online. Under Logs report it shows that the EPP client receives the policies (CAP for Example). But on the EPP Client itself the tab ""Content Aware Protection"" is not showing.
The EPP Client is not behaving normal.
A screenshot of the nginx configuration is also provided.
The customer is not using a Load balancer or a proxy Server.

Please see the screenshots in the attachments folder.
I also learned about the customer's history, they could not use our product with DPI for 1+ years due to incompatibility between EPP client and Bitdefeder DCI Drivers","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-20T08:00:43.000Z"
