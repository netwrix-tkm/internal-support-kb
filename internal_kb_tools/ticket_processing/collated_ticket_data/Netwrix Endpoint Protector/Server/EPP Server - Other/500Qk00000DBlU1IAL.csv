"500Qk00000DBlU1IAL","00415271","Support Ticket","Full database export","Hi,

Due to end of our contract we would like to have all our data from EPP server exported. Our customer success manager advised us to open a support ticket for this request.
So please let me know if we can have some kind of database export, if possible in some readable format?
If yes, can we request this in a separate ticket when we approach to our license end date?

Thank you
