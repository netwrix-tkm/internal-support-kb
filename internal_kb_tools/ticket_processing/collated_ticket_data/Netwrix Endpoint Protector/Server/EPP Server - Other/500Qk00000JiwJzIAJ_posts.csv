Services were stopped.
Backed up /var/lib/mysql and /var/eppfiles/mysql (from 2 separate partitions) to a newly-created temporary disk.
Disk was extended to 200 GB finally.
Removed last 3 partitions (the 2 separate partitions above and the extended partition that held them) and created a new ext4 partition that replaces the three on which backed up data was put back.
/etc/mysql/my.cnf was configured to point to /var/eppfiles/mysql instead of /var/lib/mysql.
apparmor profile was modified to include /var/eppfiles/mysql
/var/lib/mysql -> /var/eppfiles/mysql symlink has been created
Services were started again.
EPP Server worked successfully in the UI.","","","","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2025-01-09T13:08:23.000Z"
