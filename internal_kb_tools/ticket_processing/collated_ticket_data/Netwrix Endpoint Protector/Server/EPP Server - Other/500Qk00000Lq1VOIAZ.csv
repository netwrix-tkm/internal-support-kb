We have installed the EPP server on an Oracle VM running on Ubuntu. However, we are unable to activate the Content-Aware module. The internet connection on the Ubuntu system is working properly. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Best regards,","","Customer could not activate the CAP module as they kept getting the error ''An error occurred while sending the request to our servers. Please contact the Endpoint Protector Support team''.
Asked the client to provide some screenshots of their license and the server info.","Arafaat already contacted the client in regards of this and when we got to do the remote session he confirmed that the issue was on the clients side as they did not allow the proper ports to be used through their Firewall.
As of now the issue is fixed.","Customer confirmed it was related to their Firewall and they made the necessary changes to allow the EPP client to communicate properly.","","Marian Ilies","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","1.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Arafaat Makandar","2025-02-13T09:20:00.000Z","2025-02-14T12:15:09.000Z"
