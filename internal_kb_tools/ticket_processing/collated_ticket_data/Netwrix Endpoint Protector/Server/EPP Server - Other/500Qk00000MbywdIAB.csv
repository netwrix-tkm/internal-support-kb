"500Qk00000MbywdIAB","00437881","Support Ticket","HTTP Download page not working","We recently upgraded our EPP server to 5.9.4.1 and the http non-encrypted version of the management page used to have a download link for downloading the client from the server, but it's no longer working.

I spoke to one of my colleagues and he said that he checked it immediately after the upgrade and it was working, but that does not seem to be the case anymore.","","The customer use case: they download the EPP clients on machines from the http client download page. They have done this for a long time.

This functionality worked till they upgraded to 5.9.4.1. Also I tested on my end and a colleagues end on 5.9.4.1 and it worked on our ends. Screenshots attached in New Remote Session folder: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00437881

I saw in the backend of the customer that there was a file missing compared to a test server: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.http.nginx.conf","Informed customer we no longer support the http client download page and recommended alternative.

Waiting on R&D.","Customer confirmed we can close after providing the below information:

The HTTP client download page is no longer supported by us since the EPP server version 5.9.4.0 and it will be removed completely in the near future. This decision was made as part of the security improvements implemented in the 5940 Server image.

At this time, there are no plans to reinstate the download page. Furthermore, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security, we are redesigning the Client upload/download mechanism in the upcoming 5950 release. Consequently, the HTTP availability will not be restored.

We assure you that clients can still be downloaded securely from the EPP Server. If desired, customers can upload these clients to their own internal HTTP portal for further distribution.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","39.7","Closed - Resolved","NBC Universal","Easton Lindauer","2025-03-06T02:28:15.000Z","2025-04-14T18:06:38.000Z"
