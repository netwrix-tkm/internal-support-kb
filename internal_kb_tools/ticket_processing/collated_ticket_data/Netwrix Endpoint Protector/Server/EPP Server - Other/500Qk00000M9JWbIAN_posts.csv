Customer is setting up SMTP connection with EPP for email alerts. He need the IP address to be allowed in my SMTP server. So can you please provide what is the IP address that is going to connect to customer's SMTP server for email sending ?

URL: <a href='https://awkb43e.hosted.endpointprotector.com/' target='_blank'>https://awkb43e.hosted.endpointprotector.com/</a>
 
Also this IP address, is it dedicated or common/shared IP address ?

Thanks in advance. 

Regards,
