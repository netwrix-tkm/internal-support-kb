If the database is large, it could take a while until it is done.
How long has it been stuck at 99%?
Did you create a snapshot of the appliance before upgrading?

We might need a remote session to check the disk space, so SSH access to the back end will be needed.
Can you let me know your timezone and availability?

Okay, if that is the case, we create two snapshots per day, so you don't really need that backup for now. If it does not finish by the end of today's work day, let me know and I will request access to your backend. If you allow me to connect in your absence I can check and let you know what I find.
I will also ask our server team if we can cancel the backup process.
Please let me know if that works for you.

I have reached out to our server team since I was not able to find a way to stop the backup process. Until I hear back from them you can leave the backup as it is.

Hi Oscar,

Okay, if that is the case, we create two snapshots per day, so you don't really need that backup for now. If it does not finish by the end of today's work day, let me know and I will request access to your backend. If you allow me to connect in your absence I can check and let you know what I find.
I will also ask our server team if we can cancel the backup process.
Please let me know if that works for you.

Yes, you should be able to apply the security patch. Since it is hosted by us, there are two snapshots taken daily.
If you'd like to make sure, we can set up a remote session, since we also need to look at your SIEM integration issue.
Let me know your time zone and availability for the next few days.

Hi Oscar,

I have reached out to our server team since I was not able to find a way to stop the backup process. Until I hear back from them you can leave the backup as it is.
As for the update, please wait a couple of days until it is available again.

Hi Oscar,

Yes, you should be able to apply the security patch. Since it is hosted by us, there are two snapshots taken daily.
If you'd like to make sure, we can set up a remote session, since we also need to look at your SIEM integration issue.
Let me know your time zone and availability for the next few days.

Thank you,

Hi Oscar,

Can you please check the status of the backup? Engineering is still looking for a way to stop the backup once it is started but no luck so far.

Hi Oscar,

I have reached out to our server team since I was not able to find a way to stop the backup process. Until I hear back from them you can leave the backup as it is.
As for the update, please wait a couple of days until it is available again.

Thank you,

Hi Oscar,

Okay, if that is the case, we create two snapshots per day, so you don't really need that backup for now. If it does not finish by the end of today's work day, let me know and I will request access to your backend. If you allow me to connect in your absence I can check and let you know what I find.
I will also ask our server team if we can cancel the backup process.
Please let me know if that works for you.
