Hello,

Our newest VM is using Ubuntu 22.04.
In order to change the Ubuntu version you are using. You will need to import the new VM and perform a server migration.

For this, you can use the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email<https://mibc-fr-03.mailinblack.com/securelink/?url=https://www.endpointprotector.com&key=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>

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed, please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating, please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.
