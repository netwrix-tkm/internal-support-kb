"500Qk00000HcAe8IAF","00425369","Support Ticket","Question regarding Configure Max File Size feature","Hello,

Could you please clarify how the Configure Max File Size feature works?
As we understand, this feature disables CAP scanning for files larger than the specified size.
We tried to make it for Excel 5MB, but EPP still blocking Excel files larger than 5MB.
Can it be that CAP policy stopped scanning the large files after it found a confidential data inside?","","","","Information provided on the feature ""Max File Size""","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","1.9","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-10-29T12:46:09.000Z","2024-10-31T11:11:03.000Z"
