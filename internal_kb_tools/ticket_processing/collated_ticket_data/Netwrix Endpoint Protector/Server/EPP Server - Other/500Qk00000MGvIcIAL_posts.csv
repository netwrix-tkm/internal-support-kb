In CKP's environment, the license is reflected as expired, even though their subscription continues. 
I request you to please check on this.
We logged a call early this year and they said it was fixed, but today when end user logged in they saw this again. 

Customer name: CKP hospitality Malaysia
Server ID: ATU80K2H

Please refer to the attached screenshot. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-25T05:37:36.000Z"
