I have checked our virtual appliance today and found there are some backend updates available for it. However i have been unable to install them even after several attempts. I have checked what i can including that the machine has sufficient space and internet access and everything looks ok. Is there any log we can look at to see why the updates will not install please?

Kind Regards,
