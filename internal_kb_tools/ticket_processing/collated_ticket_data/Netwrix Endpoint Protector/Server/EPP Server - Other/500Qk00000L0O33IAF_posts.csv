We are preparing to upgrade our Endpoint Protector server and are planning to set up a new server and migrate all of our user/group data over to the new server. However, we are concerned about how the licensing would work while migrating data as that would technically require running two servers simultaneously during the migration. 

Is this something that is currently supported by our licensing or do we need to request some kind of temporary license to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Easton","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-23T21:35:04.000Z"
