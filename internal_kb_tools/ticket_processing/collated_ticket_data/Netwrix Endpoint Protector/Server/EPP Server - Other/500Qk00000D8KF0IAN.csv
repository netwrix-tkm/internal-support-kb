"500Qk00000D8KF0IAN","00415099","Support Ticket","Session Timeout","Hallo Support,

We have set the following values for the session timeout
Session timeout (min): 15
Timeout counter (sec): 60

As far as I could tell from the online documentation, the session timeout is valid for inactivity.
<a href='https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.3/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemConfiguration/Overview.htm' target='_blank'>https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.3/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemConfiguration/Overview.htm</a>
However, I get the session timeout message every 14 minutes. Even if I make a change within 14 minutes.

Can you please tell me whether this is a bug or whether the session timeout is set regardless of activity/inactivity.

Regards
