I had a remote session with the customer, and apparently when their VPN solution is turned on, the EPP client stops communicating to the server.
I collected the logs, and compiled screenshots and information in a Word document, and uploaded them to Onedrive:

@WaitingOnEngineer to answer the questions we would require logs and extended DPI logs. We also recommend using the newer agent:

_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_09_23/EppMac_v3.0.4.1000


to collect the logs.
