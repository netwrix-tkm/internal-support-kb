I’d say that there is a communication but what’s strange: the fields für Administrator, Telefon and E-Mail are empty. I’m pretty sure, that this was different before I’d discovered this.

Hello,

I’ve done that yesterday two times on two different clients already. I’ also tried the previous client version. New installed clients (never been in the system before) don’t get a license ore settings and are not displayed in the server dashboards.
Server-IP is already configured in the setup file for the client. The behavior is strange, because all the old clients seem to communicate but at least at the dashboard displays last connection about one month before.

thanks, fort the support.

I’d say that there is a communication but what’s strange: the fields für Administrator, Telefon and E-Mail are empty. I’m pretty sure, that this was different before I’d discovered this.

Hello Detlef,

Thank you for reaching out to support. One of my colleagues who works in your timezone will reach out to you in the next business day at their earliest.
In the meantime can you please check to see if the agent communicates with the server?
Open the agent UI from the taskbar and in the settings tab, press ctrl+alt+i, or if on a mac, command+option+i, and send us a screenshot.

Hello,

I’ve done that yesterday two times on two different clients already. I’ also tried the previous client version. New installed clients (never been in the system before) don’t get a license ore settings and are not displayed in the server dashboards.
Server-IP is already configured in the setup file for the client. The behavior is strange, because all the old clients seem to communicate but at least at the dashboard displays last connection about one month before.

Hello,

 

I’ve done that yesterday two times on two different clients already. I’ also tried the previous client version. New installed clients (never been in the system before) don’t get a license ore settings and are not displayed in the server dashboards.

Server-IP is already configured in the setup file for the client. The behavior is strange, because all the old clients seem to communicate but at least at the dashboard displays last connection about one month before.

thanks, fort the support.

I’d say that there is a communication but what’s strange: the fields für Administrator, Telefon and E-Mail are empty.

Hello Detlef,

Thank you for reaching out to support. One of my colleagues who works in your timezone will reach out to you in the next business day at their earliest.

Thank you,
