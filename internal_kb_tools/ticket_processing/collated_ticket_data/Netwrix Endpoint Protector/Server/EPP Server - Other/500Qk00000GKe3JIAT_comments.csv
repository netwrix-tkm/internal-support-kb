After connecting in the backend we found out that the problem was that more computers existed with the same name on the node and the relation on unify was made with the computer that did not communicate. This problem occurred because in previous version when a computer was deleted from UI, it was only soft deleted on nodes. In 720 this problem is solved, but similar cases might appear to computers that have been previously deleted in older versions.
