Hi Flaviu, 
Since this is a customer hosted installation installing anything on it will require the customer to sign the NDR and also the waiver as is procedure. They will receive a supplemental user account with which they can install anything that they want on the instance.

Also please note, based on this they will have to install the Azure ARC agent beforehand: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agent-linux?tabs=wrapper-script
