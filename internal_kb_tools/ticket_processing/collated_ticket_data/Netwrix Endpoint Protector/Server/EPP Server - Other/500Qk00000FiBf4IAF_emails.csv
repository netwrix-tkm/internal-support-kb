Hi Lam,

For this we will need to review the logs captured while this issue is reproduced, where it creates event logs with count 1 while the CAP Policy is set to threshold of 10.  We have the screenshots but will also need the logs to have a look and see what is actually happening on the client.

Can you enable the debug logging and reproduce the issue, uploaded the logs to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us please?

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact).

Hi André,

 

How about the false positive with the records count to 1 while the threshold is setting to 10?




Thanks and Best Regard,

Hi Xuan,

Is your organization making use of GitHub Client?  if you don't use this application then you can block the application completely and prevent it from running by adding it to the applications denylist this way the application won't be a risk as an exit point for data leakage.

If you are using it for only some users then you can create a CAP policy to block the application for the users who don't need it and use a separate CAP policy for users that do need to use the application.


If  you are using Github Client and you are only accessing Git repositories over ""https"", then you can use DPI + the ""Restricted Apps"" feature:

Hi André,
 

I deselected GitHub Client as per your suggestion. Let's wait to see its efficiency. In the meantime, may I ask how we can control the DLP on GitHub Client if it is deselected? Do you have other best practices for GitHub Client?

 

Regards,

Xuan

Hi Xuan,

The feedback that I got after discussing this case with our Dev team is that the ""Github Client"" is the reason behind the thousands of CAP event logs / entries.
The Github application will report all files that are touched by the application even though they are not actually transferred anywhere.  The Github application usually works with user files, it's not just opening it's application files and as a result it creates a lot of false positives as it ""touches"" various of files that contain source code.

The first suggestion made is to deselect ""GitHub Client"" under ""Cloud Services / File Sharing"" as shown in the below screenshot, can you try to deselect it and observe if you are still getting a huge number of event logs under Content Aware Report and let us know please?
