"500Qk00000It67FIAR","00428403","Support Ticket","Adjust resources in VM","Hi support team,

this customer purchased 12k licenses for Active Data Defence and the contract starts on 1-Jan-2025 (on prem).
Please reach out to the customer in order to schedule a session to adjust the resources and settings in their VM.
I already told them that we recommend to use 16 CPU cores, 56GB RAM und 4 TB HDD. They can only allocate 1 TB HDD at the moment but deployment will be finalized until Q2 next year so the VM will not run on max utilization until then.

Contact is: 
lukas.rust@hannover-stadt.de. 
Please add jan.siebert@acp.de, andre.hegel@acp.de from our partner and me in that scheduling email as well.

Thank you
Markus","","","","Server optimised.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Landeshauptstadt Hannover","Lukas Rust","2024-11-28T09:25:40.000Z","2024-12-11T09:20:29.000Z"
