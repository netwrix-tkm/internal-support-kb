Some improvements were made on 5.9.4.0 on the System Maintenance -> File Maintenance page.
Starting with this version, the shadows can be manipulated from this page.


Another way to remove shadows from the server is using the Audit Log Backup.

Customer returned with the following message: 

We have just completed the server update to version 5.9.4.0.

After the update, we found that the shadow list on the File Maintenance page is displayed, but it does not indicate which computer the file shadow belongs to. Additionally, in the Server Information, the number of File Shadows is still showing as 0. I have attached screenshots from the level 1 to level 3 directory of the File Maintenance, which show file shadows without indicating the computer name, as well as the Server Information.

Could you please let me know if there are other workarounds that we can use to temporarily resolve this issue until the fix is released?

Thank you!","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-08-12T13:52:16.000Z","2024-08-12T13:52:16.000Z","false","false"

Hi,

Yes, these were the fixes made in 5940 for the File Maintenance page. Based on the changes made for shadows starting with 5800 the shadows are no longer associated with the PC in the backend. 

They can be identified using the file hash. Please enable the File Hash column from the ""Show /Hide Column"" button on CAP Report or File Trancing or Logs Report.

On the File Maintenance page, the shadow can be identified by hash in the following way:

	 - 	first_two_characters_of_hash/second_two_characthers_of_hash/file_hash.extension.

Customer returned with the following statements: 

Could you please clarify the purpose of this new file maintenance format? It seems to be a step back for current users who manage a large number of endpoints and who now need to put more effort into file shadow maintenance.

Additionally, we tested on our EPP NFR server (with versions 5.93 & 5.94) and observed inconsistent file maintenance displays, with shadows still being displayed for enabled fileshadow endpoints (5.93) and particular endpoints (5.94), as attached in this ticket.

There are 2 new screenshots added today that show the details described above.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-08-15T12:31:42.000Z","2024-08-15T12:31:42.000Z","false","false"

The customer would like to delete the shadows that are very big in his system . At the moment they have over 600gb of shadows stored. 
The shadows are not older than one month. 
When we are trying to investigate which one is the biggest one we need to navigate in each folder to see them . 

We used the following command to erase them : find /var/eppfiles/shadows/ -mindepth 1 -mtime +90 -delete; and find /var/eppfiles/shadows/ -mindepth 1 -mtime +60 -delete;  nothing was deleted. 

They have an audit backup log scheduled for every 2 weeks and collects the logs older than 6 months.

Can you please assist us with a set of commands in order to identify and to delete the biggest shadow files from the server ?","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-08-26T10:24:01.000Z","2024-08-26T10:24:01.000Z","false","false"

Please inform the customer that deleting shadows from the server will impact the UI. The download button will still appear on the UI if the shaodw is manually removed from the server.


Using these commands, ( find /var/eppfiles/shadows/ -mindepth 1 -mtime +90 -delete; and find /var/eppfiles/shadows/ -mindepth 1 -mtime +60 -delete;
 ) you are trying to delete shadows that are older that 60 days or 90 days. 

You have mention this:  ""The shadows are not older than one month.""


If the customer really wants to delete the shadows from the server in the above way, you should adjust the command to take into consideration shadows older than 30 days.
