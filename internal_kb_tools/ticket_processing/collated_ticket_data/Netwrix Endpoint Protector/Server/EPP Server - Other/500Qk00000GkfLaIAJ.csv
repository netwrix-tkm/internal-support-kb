"500Qk00000GkfLaIAJ","00423202","Support Ticket","Blue Halo needing assistance","Hello, I got this email from Blue Halo. They need assistance with Azure Monitoring Agent, below is the email.
I am reaching out again as we are expanding our coverage of EPP currently. One of the things that came up again is that we do not have the Azure Monitoring Agent on the machine yet. That was part of our contingencies to continued use. Please advise on how we can make that happen as we do not maintain access to the host itself. We can provide the installer if needed.","","","","Received confirmation from legal.
