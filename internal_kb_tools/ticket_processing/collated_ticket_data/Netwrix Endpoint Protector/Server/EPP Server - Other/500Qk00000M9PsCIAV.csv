if i try to get events via API with filters i get the following errors/results

&filter_by[event_id]=20
--> Invoke-RestMethod : The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.
See <a href='https://01_Eventid.png' target='_blank'>01_Eventid.png</a>

&filter_by[event_name]=Blocked
--> i get events, but the events also contains items with event_name = Unblocked
see <a href='https://02_event_name.png' target='_blank'>02_event_name.png</a>

&filter_by[device_type]=Webcam
--> Invoke-RestMethod : The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.
see <a href='https://03_device_type.png' target='_blank'>03_device_type.png</a>

&filter_by[vid]=0&filter_by[pid]=0
--> The results contains items where vid and pid are not 0
see <a href='https://04_vid_pid.png' target='_blank'>04_vid_pid.png</a>

Please check and provide feedback if the error is in the query or if it is an error in the API.

Regards

Anatoli","","- a ticket was raised to QA so that we can provide an explanation to the customer regarding their request.
- The explanation was:
The result returned by API is correct, given the fact that the items used for filtering accept multiple selections.
For the query to work the request needs to be like : 


--- CODE ---/api/logs/device-control?limit=10&page=1&direction=DESC&filter_by[device_type_id][]=1,
--- CODE ---

 Meaning for parameters that accept multiple selections before, ""="" ""[ ]"" is needed, also the correct parameter for device_type is device_type_id.

For this specific query the parameters that accept multiple selections are: 

- event_id, 
- machine_name, 
- device_name, 
- client_name and 
- device_type_id.","- check with QA
- check if the explanation is satisfactory with the customer","The explanation is satisfactory with the customer and the customer closed the ticket from their side","Guidance","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","17.1","Closed - Resolved","BMW Group AG","Anatoli Lorenz","2025-02-21T14:21:18.000Z","2025-03-10T15:52:30.000Z"
