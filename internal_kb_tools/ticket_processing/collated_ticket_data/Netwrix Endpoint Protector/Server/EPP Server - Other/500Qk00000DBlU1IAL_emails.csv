There are a few ways of exporting your data/logs:

1. By using the Audit Log backup functionality
How to use: on the EPP UI please go to System Maintenance -> Audit Log Backup - and se it up there.
This will create archives of the logs that you can then download locally on your computer.

2. SIEM Integration
How to use: if you have a SIEM(like splunk) you can configure it on the EPP server from Appliance -> SIEM Integration - and it will export the logs to your SIEM.

Please let me know if these work for you.
