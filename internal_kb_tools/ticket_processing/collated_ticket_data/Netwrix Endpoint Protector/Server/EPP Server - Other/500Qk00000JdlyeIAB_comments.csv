@WaitingOnEngineer 
can you please post the video? The logs appear to have captured the 
state before the VPN was used, or I don't see anything out of the 
ordinary in them.

I was able to reproduce this issue by installing the Browsec browser extension. The fix (that worked for me) was to add the port 1022 under the ""Deep Packet Inspection Ports & Settings"" / ""Custom Ports"" like in the screenshot found here: Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 17.15.44.png

The ""traffic type"" dropdown was set to ""HTTPS"".
