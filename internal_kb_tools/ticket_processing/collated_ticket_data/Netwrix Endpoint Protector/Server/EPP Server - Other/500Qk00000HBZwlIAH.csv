This is just a question.I moved my server dns (<a href='https://Epp.aristanetworks.com' target='_blank'>Epp.aristanetworks.com</a>) that was assigned with the older server to point to the newer server. However I dont see any clients reporting to the newer server yet. Should I bounce the server old & New ?
