Thank you for your time on our call earlier.  As mentioned on our call I confirmed with one of our developers that the Enforced Encryption (EasyLock) link which is publicly accessible ""https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt"" and the data displayed in it does not pose a security risk and that anything sensitive in this file is encrypted using the master password that is only stored on the EPP server.

Hello Vikash,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00425886. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00425886
Ticket Subject: Exposed URL severity check
Ticket Details: We got an external mail that one of our public URL is exposing some sensitive encryption keys and configuration data.
I need to understand the criticality and severity of this and where it is hosted.

Note: Before proceeding with any fixes or activity for the given URL, let's have a discussion first. I will be scheduling a call with you for better clarification of this, in the meantime please go through the details.

URL: <a href='https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt' target='_blank'>https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt</a>

Below is the procedure and impact that is shared by an external person ( bug bounty hunter ).
Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to <a href='https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt' target='_blank'>https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt</a>
Observe the displayed data which includes encryption keys (ivMp, saltMp, mpPub, encMpPrivByMp), unique identifiers (elId), and various configuration settings (pingInterval, passwordRules).
Expected Result: Sensitive data, especially related to encryption and system configurations, should not be accessible via a public URL. Access should be restricted to authorized personnel through secured means.

Actual Result: Encryption keys and configuration data are openly accessible through a public URL without any form of authentication or access control.

Impact: This exposure can lead to potential security breaches, unauthorized data access, and could be exploited by malicious entities to compromise the system’s security, decrypt sensitive data, or conduct targeted attacks.

Thank you!
