We checked the client server communication and it seems to work fine. Also, we tried to force the reregister of the machine, and it successfully registered on the server. 

Then, on the server side, we enabled the WebService logs and we looked in the WebService.log and WebsSrviceFree.log files. Here we found some MySQL errors: Policy Errors, Rights Errors and Ping Errors.

Judit needs the log files in order to further investigate the issue. I asked Bogdan to help us and download the log files from the server and to send them over to Judit.
 
The customer asked why we display the ""Policy received"" logs if no logs are being sent from the client. (there might be multiple machines in the same situation)

Also, I should get back to the customer with an e-mail and let him know about the next steps in order to address the issue. 

Can you let me know what should I tell the customer about this? Can we fix this issue on their server or it will be addressed in a future patch?

Since there might be multiple machines which are not sending logs to the server, I don't think that the customer would wait for a future patch.

I have investigated the problem with the only log received (Policy Received) on specific computers, and here is what I found:

1. In the 7.1.2 version, I found a problem with the devices; after the client was installed on a computer for the first time, all the devices present in the agent console should also appear in the Device Control -> Devices section ( I was also able to reproduce this problem on an EPP with a 5940 version.) This bug was fixed in Unify in 7.2.0 and needs to be rechecked after the patch application.
2. Also, if the devices are already connected to a computer when the agent is installed, the logs for specific devices will appear in the server only after we do some modification related to the device( ex, change right, connect the device), here I also checked the QuickLogs from the agent. The only event sent is the Server Certificate Disabled.
3. I suggest a new support connection with somebody from the DevOps team to see if the communication with the agent is working. They are using proxies on these computers, and we couldn't check this during our last session connection.
If the communication works well, we should connect to the databases, check the devices from these computers, and see if some logs remain in Redis.
Also, if you are setting up a new support session, please ensure you have access to the CrateDB.

In regards to point 3.1 from the previous comment we have no limitations in place on the network Firewall as shown in the screenshots bellow:


EPP Core SG


MC Node SG

From my perspective if the customer is using a Proxy they would need to check the connectivity on their side.
PLEASE NOTE: Ping is disabled by default in the AWS Cloud. We can enable it if the customer wants to test this with a Ping. As an alternative we would recommend using Telnet or similar to check if the Endpoint is able to reach the EPP Core node's IP on the 443 port. The IP's for the individual EPP Core Nodes are: 3.78.178.203 and 35.158.38.187.

Alin, as next step, please inform the customer that he needs to run some tests using their proxy, to check the connectivity on their side as per the below recommendations.
Afterwards we will need their feedback to find out how it went.
if everything will be ok, then a new remote can be established with our engineering, but the next important step is them to test the connectivity

After Friday's investigation, we found two server-side errors related to log processing, which we consider to be the root cause of the missing logs.

Judit discovered the first one in the previous investigation. We have an ADO ticket for it https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-Unify/_workitems/edit/362089
Due to the new client communication refactoring, it does not apply to the 7.2.0 sources.
We have a fix for the 7.1.2 version estimated as a Unify S size.

The second error discovered was caused by some special characters, reported by the EPP agent, that could not be processed on the server side.

The next step, on the server side, is to reproduce the issues, locally.

We need to export the logs collected on Friday, on the server side.
Logs were stored in the below location ""/var/eppfiles/quicklogs/errors/Web service.log"".

@Bogdan Melinte, can you help us with the export? I'm not sure if some approvals are required on the customer side in this case.

Using the log samples, we can make more accurate tests with the exact special characters that were causing the log processing issues.

In the latest WebService.log file received from the customer, I identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty( this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).

It would help us to know how they deployed the agents(whether manually or automatically using some tool).
It is also important to know if they have access to their machines through some tool (in our latest support connection, the EPP service was restored using the command line and not connected to that machine) even when the user is not logged on to the machine.
This case will somehow explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and this issue when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not entered in the server.

The Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.


Please note:

The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.
 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-11-05T08:33:43.000Z","2024-11-05T08:33:43.000Z","false","false"

When checking the Logs on the UI side, the only event that was shown was ""Policy received"" and this is happening for all 120k endpoints. The last ""Blocked"" event was seen in the UI on 17th of October.
We also used a test computer that was connected and was receiving policies, but in the UI computer list is shown as Offline.
There was a discussion about the fact that the users are not logged in on the computers and that is why logs are not getting through but as we could see in the EPP client of this test computer, there was a user logged there. When performing a device connect to the computer, no log came up in the UI although the clientlog shows that they were sent successfully to the server.

""The report was reviewed. The blocked events for October looks good (no missing days found).


However, two other errors were identified.

1. Logs Report with filter “Date/Time (Server) (From)” show values from the past

2. Exported reports contain entries from the previous day (possibly a calculation error due to time zone)""

I will raise separate cases for the two mentioned points.
I also checked today the logs that are in queue for the workers and there is no increase since yesterday.
