I have just received an update from our colleagues regarding the possibility to run a script that clears the boot partition, that presented issues when upgrading the EPP server.

At the moment we unfortunately do not have an automated script for this. It is still being worked on. My colleagues recommended, in case the issue persists after migrating to hosted by us, to clear the space as we did till now, until the script is implemented.

Please let me know if we can close this ticket.

Hi Veronica,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we applied the clean boot partitions steps and then we were able to apply the updates.

We will leave this ticket open till we receive updates from our colleagues regarding the fact that this is a reoccurring issue.

I will let you know as soon as I receive any news.

Something odd is going on with the server and I cannot tell what is happening in terms of updates.  I have a whole lot of vulnerabilities piling up, so I checked the backend updates.  I saw this:

 



As you can see, it is a large list. 

 

I installed and then went to verify that the install worked because of this issue, but the admin actions log shows blanks for everything – even the check of the backend updates as well as the Apply.”

 



 

 

I cannot tell what is happening here – if the UI is failing or the report is not working or what, but I am up to 16 vulnerabilities.  I would think at least some of them should be resolvable.

Hi Veronica,

Please let me know if you have availability Monday or Tuesday next week after 11:00am EDT for a remote session and we will take a look. Please also create a Snapshot of the EPP server before our remote session.

Something odd is going on with the server and I cannot tell what is happening in terms of updates.  I have a whole lot of vulnerabilities piling up, so I checked the backend updates.  I saw this:

[cid:22c05a09-c96f-4755-a338-c0d5cea2bf76@Image_1_]
As you can see, it is a large list.

I installed and then went to verify that the install worked because of this issue, but the admin actions log shows blanks for everything – even the check of the backend updates as well as the Apply.”

[cid:9214ed02-f11f-403b-8272-5c9f5ba81eea@Image_2_]


I cannot tell what is happening here – if the UI is failing or the report is not working or what, but I am up to 16 vulnerabilities.  I would think at least some of them should be resolvable.

Hi Veronica,

For the OpenSSL Vulnerabilities our devs said it will be address in the next image.

I have also chased with my colleagues the internal ticket regarding the upgrading of the EPP server and the backend security updates not applying.

I will let you know as soon as I have more information on this.

Are there any updates on the release that will address all of the critical vulnerabilities that related to OpenSSL and others?

Hi Veronica,

We have raised this ticket in order to further investigate with our devs the issue that is happening with the Backend Security Updates not working correctly after each EPP server upgrade.

We will keep you posted as soon as we receive updates on this.
