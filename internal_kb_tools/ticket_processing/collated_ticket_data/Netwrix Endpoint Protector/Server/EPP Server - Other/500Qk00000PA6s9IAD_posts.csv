As a result, we would like to deploy a new virtual appliance as soon as possible.

Please guide us through the process of activating or re-registering a new instance. We can provide any necessary license information, previous appliance details, or logs (if recoverable).

Let us know if there are any steps or prerequisites we need to follow before the deployment.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-14T16:00:58.000Z"
