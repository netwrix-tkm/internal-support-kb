Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.

Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:

- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

Dear Team,

There is option of exclude files & folders but not process for MacBooks in Sophos.
Also, we tested this after uninstalling Sophos in one MacBook, but we are able to upload files after uninstalling the Sophos also.

Dear Team,

 

There is option of exclude files & folders but not process for MacBooks in Sophos.

Also, we tested this after uninstalling Sophos in one MacBook, but we are able to upload files after uninstalling the Sophos also.

Hi Pankaj,

Thanks for the update!

Would it be possible to whitelist the processes as well on macOS?
Process level exclusions:


	EppClient
	sslsplit
	netdlp_setup
	EppNotifier



Please also let me know if you're using any other software that intercepts and/or scans traffic.

Dear Team,

 

There is option of exclude files & folders but not process for MacBooks in Sophos.

Also, we tested this after uninstalling Sophos in one MacBook, but we are able to upload files after uninstalling the Sophos also.

Hi Pankaj,

Thanks for the update!

Would it be possible to whitelist the processes as well on macOS?
Process level exclusions:


	EppClient
	sslsplit
	netdlp_setup
	EppNotifier



Please also let me know if you're using any other software that intercepts and/or scans traffic.

Dear Team,

 

We excluded all required items through process in Windows, File & folders in MacOS. But still, we are able to upload files. Please find below the screenshot of excluded items in Sophos. Red coloured items are of MacOS & blue coloured are of Windows.

 



 

Please check all required items under exclusions are okay, and please let us know if any changes require.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.

Dear Team,

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

[cid:221ebb04-3db4-4f9f-9d2e-d6a816cd7819]

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

[cid:06ad321a-6202-4860-b63f-5bdcebbefb50]

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.
We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Pankaj Kumar.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.

Just to confirm, by working fine on the system with Sophos installed, do you mean to say the file was blocked from uploading?

Dear Team,

 

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

 



 

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

 



 

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.

We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you or the update!

Just to confirm, by working fine on the system with Sophos installed, do you mean to say the file was blocked from uploading?

Dear Team,

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

[cid:cedbd471-161a-46b1-8767-05ea387d715c@Image_0_]

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

[cid:ef36c995-990c-41d1-9478-a8fef68ec651@Image_1_]

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.
We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Pankaj Kumar.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you or the update!

Just to confirm, by working fine on the system with Sophos installed, do you mean to say the file was blocked from uploading?

Dear Team,

 

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

 



 

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

 



 

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.

We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.

Dear Team,

Just providing some clarity that the blocking is happening with other customer's DLP policy, not in which we are trying to fix it (for which we raised the ticket)

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you or the update!

Just to confirm, by working fine on the system with Sophos installed, do you mean to say the file was blocked from uploading?

Dear Team,

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

[cid:b68b0605-bb2c-4947-b1c3-9a7ccbe974c5@Image_1_]

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

[cid:b8cb2d6a-be61-4ee3-87de-f4815cd9acef@Image_2_]

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.
We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.

Dear Team,

 

Just providing some clarity that the blocking is happening with other customer's DLP policy, not in which we are trying to fix it (for which we raised the ticket)

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you or the update!

Just to confirm, by working fine on the system with Sophos installed, do you mean to say the file was blocked from uploading?

Dear Team,

 

Today, we fresh reinstalled one MacBook laptop, after installing the test build DLP, we tried to upload files, and the file uploaded (not blocked). There was not any other software installed on this system. Attaching below the screenshot of uploaded file on dlptest.com.

 



 

Also, attaching below the screenshot of DLP version of installed test build.

 



 

Also, the same CAP policy applied on another DLP customer, and it is working fine in the system with Sophos installed on it.

We didn't try on Windows system with provided test build DLP till now. We will update the status of Windows after testing it.

Hi Pankaj,

Thank you for your patience!

We managed to checked the logs, and found the Sophos Endpoint Defense is interfering with our product.
Please whitelist the following EPP processes in Sophos:
- EPPservice.exe
- sslsplit.exe
- cssguard.exe
- EPPNotifier.exe

In case it's needed, they are located in: C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector

After whitelisting, please re-test and let me know how it goes.
