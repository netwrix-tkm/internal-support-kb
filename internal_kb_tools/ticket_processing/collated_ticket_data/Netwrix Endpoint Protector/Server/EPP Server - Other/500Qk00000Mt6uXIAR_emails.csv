In order to make sure they are not taking up licenses, you can double check in System Configuration -> System Licensing -> View Licenses.
If those computers are not showing up there, you can delete them from Device Control -> Computers.

Hi - Botond,

Just to clarify, these devices are offline, they don't appear to be using any licenses[cid:0d6e8426-8191-4597-bfbb-306b7299a716]They no longer have the Endpoint Protector Client installed (removed after PoC). I want them to have the EPP Client.  Should I remove these computers from the EP console and deploy the EPP Client fresh to these devices?

Kind Regards,
Pete

Thanks for clarifying!
It would be better to start fresh with them, so it's best to delete them.
You can delete multiple computers at once by selecting them, and clicking on the Delete button on the bottom of the page.

Hi - Botond, 

 

Just to clarify, these devices are offline, they don't appear to be using any licensesThey no longer have the Endpoint Protector Client installed (removed after PoC). I want them to have the EPP Client.  Should I remove these computers from the EP console and deploy the EPP Client fresh to these devices?

 

Kind Regards,

Pete

Hi Pete,

It's not necessary to delete them if you don't want to, it's enough to remove their licenses.

If i release the licenses from the computers, do I then need to delete the computers from device control afterwards?

Hi Pete,

You can remove the licenses from those computers by clicking the red button on the right side.
You can also set up Automatic License Release to automatically remove them from computers which haven't been online in a specific time.

Hi Botond,

 

Thanks for getting back to me. I can see the licenses are being used, but the clients are no longer installed on the endpoints. What do you advise I should do?

Pete

Hi Pete,

Thanks for reaching out!

In order to make sure they are not taking up licenses, you can double check in System Configuration -> System Licensing -> View Licenses.
If those computers are not showing up there, you can delete them from Device Control -> Computers.
