setting up the new VM worked well with the instructions from the manual. However, I'm having difficulties with the configuration window in the VM and can't get any further with the instructions alone. 
 
I set the network manually and took the network access addresses from the HyperV for the gateway and name server. These also match the network point that I selected when setting up the VM. The specified IP address should also be within the valid range. If I go to “Apply” with this data, the bar loads to 75% and then the main menu appears again with the specified IP address as the appliance IP.  However, unlike in the instructions, I still see the possibility of editing the network and the appliance cannot be accessed under the IP. The automatic setting doesn't work either.
 
Attached you will find screenshots of the various windows. Thank you very much and I look forward to your feedback!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-03T09:58:33.000Z"

It took my parameters but I still couldn’t access the application page. Your colleague presumed it was because of the chosen ip address and recommended to check the available ip addresses.

However, I was able to test the ip addresses on our old Endpoint Protector server and everything worked fine. Yesterday, I checked the settings once more and compared it to the old server again. That’s when I noticed that the VLAN ID was set at a wrong number in the VM settings for the network component „Ex“. Afterwards everything worked like in the manual.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-15T12:45:42.000Z"
