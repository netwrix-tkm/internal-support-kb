We have Automatic Release License feature enabled for endpoints which were last online more than 90 days.
There are still several computers that have license and last seen was in 2022. Also there are several endpoints where last seen is more than 90 days.

How does this feature work, is there a cronjob? Is it a script runs outside of the EPP folder? Can we investigate the issue?","","The license status for the comptuers is not correctly displayed in Device Control -> Computers","The only way to address this is by applying a workaround.
Waiting for the customer to schedule a remote session in order to address this.","Solved during remote session","","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","212.5","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Serhat Demir","2024-07-24T08:55:31.000Z","2025-02-21T21:04:07.000Z"
