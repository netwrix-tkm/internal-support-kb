I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

In regard to the debug files that we created on the server side on Friday, is it ok for us to download them from the server in order to continue the investigation?
We would need your confirmation on this.

Hi Alin,

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.
The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

Please note:

  *   The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
  *   With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.
The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.
[cid:image002.png@01DB2F63.2B5F1140]

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

@Markus Durst<mailto:Markus.Durst@netwrix.com> @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com<mailto:claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com>: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

In regard to the debug files that we created on the server side on Friday, is it ok for us to download them from the server in order to continue the investigation?
We would need your confirmation on this.

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Alin Anca

Hi Alin,

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.
The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

Please note:

  1.  The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
  2.  With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.
The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.
[cid:image001.png@01DB31EC.1AFF1850]

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

@Markus Durst<mailto:Markus.Durst@netwrix.com> @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com<mailto:claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com>: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Alin Anca

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

You are now free to change the refresh time interval to 30 minutes (1800 seconds).
Please send us a confirmation once you've done this so that we can add the necessary workers.

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.
The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

Please note:

  1.  The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
  2.  With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.
The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.
[cid:image001.png@01DB31F0.EE6E9C20]

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

@Markus Durst<mailto:Markus.Durst@netwrix.com> @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com<mailto:claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com>: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Alin Anca

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Alin Anca

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Best regards,

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.
The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

Please note:

  1.  The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
  2.  With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.
The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.
[cid:image001.png@01DB31F6.8395CCB0]

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

@Markus Durst<mailto:Markus.Durst@netwrix.com> @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com<mailto:claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com>: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hi Alin,

 

the confirmation applies to the increase in server resources (workers, memory,…) and the downtime.

Please let us know when the increase in resources has been completed.

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

In regard to the debug files that we created on the server side on Friday, is it ok for us to download them from the server in order to continue the investigation?
We would need your confirmation on this.

Hi Alin,

The report was reviewed. The blocked events for October looks good (no missing days found).

However, two other errors were identified.

  1.  Logs Report with filter ""Date/Time (Server) (From)"" show values from the past
[cid:image001.png@01DB3512.004C85A0]
  2.  Exported reports contain entries from the previous day (possibly a calculation error due to time zone)
[cid:image004.png@01DB3513.0391F730]
Cases will be opened during the day.

Regards

Hi Alin,

the confirmation applies to the increase in server resources (workers, memory,...) and the downtime.
Please let us know when the increase in resources has been completed.

Thank you

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.
The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

Please note:

  1.  The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
  2.  With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.
The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.
[cid:image002.png@01DB3512.004C85A0]

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

@Markus Durst<mailto:Markus.Durst@netwrix.com> @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com<mailto:claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com>: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hi Alin,

 

The report was reviewed. The blocked events for October looks good (no missing days found).

 

However, two other errors were identified.


	Logs Report with filter “Date/Time (Server) (From)” show values from the past
	
	Exported reports contain entries from the previous day (possibly a calculation error due to time zone)
	


Cases will be opened during the day.

 

Regards

Hello,

Thank you for your time today.
We could see that the optimization of the server translated in a large amount of logs to be processed during the weekend, there are about 5 Mil. logs remaining to get processed.
As discussed, I have set up a follow-up meeting for tomorrow at 10:00 CET, and I'll add the link also below:

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hi Alin,

 

The report was reviewed. The blocked events for October looks good (no missing days found).

 

However, two other errors were identified.


	Logs Report with filter “Date/Time (Server) (From)” show values from the past
	
	Exported reports contain entries from the previous day (possibly a calculation error due to time zone)
	


Cases will be opened during the day.

 

Regards

Hello,

Thank you for your time today.
We could see that the optimization of the server translated in a large amount of logs to be processed during the weekend, there are about 5 Mil. logs remaining to get processed.
As discussed, I have set up a follow-up meeting for tomorrow at 10:00 CET, and I'll add the link also below:

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

Hello,

Thank you for your time today.
We could see that the optimization of the server translated in a large amount of logs to be processed during the weekend, there are about 5 Mil. logs remaining to get processed.
As discussed, I have set up a follow-up meeting for tomorrow at 10:00 CET, and I'll add the link also below:

Hello,

The addition of the workers on the server side has been successfully performed and we could see that new logs are also getting through.
We have also finished the investigation regarding the missing client versions, we have added an improvement in that section, that will be present also in the 7.2.0 version.
As discussed, I have scheduled a follow-up meeting for tomorrow morning at 9:30 CET, I'll add the link below:

Hello,

Thank you for your time this morning.
We have discussed with the DevOps team the matter of the 98% memory usage that is shown on the UI side, and in reality only 7GB out of 30GB Ram are used, the rest is the memory cache, this is why is displayed like that in the UI.
After an analysis on the usage of resources, we managed to optimize a cache rebuild process to run at a larger time interval in order for the workers to be more quick in bringing the logs. An increase in the memory resource section would unfortnately not bring improvements for the time being.
I am sending you a invite for 15:00 CET to discuss again about this matter and after that we will continue the investigation in the backend for the client version issue, please see the link below:

Hi Alin,

 

the Endpoint Protector Agent is distributed using SCCM.

The installation with SCCM is carried out with the system user.

 

Please note:


	The service restart in the sessions was done via PsExec.
	With PsExec, the entered commandlines are executed directly on the client. Regardless of a user login.


 

However, an empty username doesn't explain why we no longer see block events in the console.

The error is also happening with my test client. A user is logged on and the agent is shown as connected.

 

I exported yesterday the Endpoint Protector logs for our service report and saw that there have been no events with type Blocked since 17.10.2024.



 

With round about 120.000 installations, this is rather unlikely. I will therefore change the priority to Critical.

 

@Markus Durst  @claudia.kurbjuhn@netwrix.com: Please prioritize the Case. We need a fix as soon as possible.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has identified some requests related to the Connected request from the agent, having the username empty (this situation occurs when no users are logged on the PC).
Can you please let us know how the agents were deployed(whether manually/automatically using some tool - which tool)?
In our last session with Anatoli we could see that he could restart the service on the computers even if he wasn't connected to the machine like as an RDP.
When this operation is performed via command line (EPP service restart) must the user be logged in on that computer? Or does this work even if the user is not logged in?
This would partially explain the requests from the agent with the username empty and when no users are logged on to a machine, and the logs are not received to the server side.

The logs look good as far as I can see. I couldn't find any missing days.
If you also don't have a high number of events in the queue, the ticket can be closed.
