I am opening this ticket regarding a question related to Syslog.

As shown in the attached image, I have observed two different types of logs coming from the EPP server.
One type is a Syslog with field names, while the other type is a Syslog without field names.

I would like to inquire about the differences between these two logs, why they appear differently, and under what circumstances each type is generated.

Thank you.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-03T04:11:58.000Z"
