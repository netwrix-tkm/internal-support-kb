"500Qk00000E0txJIAR","00417031","Support Ticket","[Bank Aladin Syayriah] Request for URL Change and Public IP Information for EPP server","Hi Support, 
We have a couple of requests and inquiries as follows from customer:

1. Server URL Change
The current server URL for Bank Aladin is <a href='https://tu4njym.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>tu4njym.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>. Customer  is requesting  a change to a more identifiable URL: <a href='https://aladinbank.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>aladinbank.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>. 
Could you please confirm if this change is feasible and provide any necessary steps or requirements before we do deployment on the endpoints?

2. Public IP Information for Whitelisting
To integrate the EPP server with Bank Aladin's Active Directory (AD) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems securely, they need to whitelist the EPP server on their firewall. Could you please provide the Public Static IP address for the EPP server?

Thank you.
