Thank you for contacting us.

If you wish to block permanently the Brave browser, you can do it by creating an application denylist like below:

Go to Denylists->Applications:


Click on ''Add'', give it a name, description and inside the Application & CLI Command type in the service that Brave uses to run, in my case was brave.exe and also add the parameter *, so brave.exe*.

Then click on Add content and you'll see it being added in the right hand side.

From there, click on generate and it should be added as a list like it shows in the above screenshot.

From there, go to your CAP policy->Policy Denylists->Applications and add it there like this:



On the computer you are testing, update the policy a couple of times and when you try to open Brave, you should get a notification like this:



In regards of your second inquiry related to mail alerts for unauthorized data transfers, I will have to take a further look and check internally and get back to you with a prompt answer.

Looking forward to your response.

First, you are going to need to make sure the Email Server Settings from here:


Are valid and once you establish a communication between the EPP server and the mail server that you have (and test to see if the test mail was sent), you can go create the CAP policy first with creating first an allowlist for the allowed domains to send e-mails to from here:


Once you create the allowlist, please add it to the CAP policy created -> Policy Allowlists:



For the rest of the restricted domains not added, you can simply select all the browsers and e-mail exit points. That way, if an user is trying to send an e-mail to a different domain than the ones mentioned in the allowlist(in this case yahoo.com), the mail along with the content will be blocked.

Now, to create the alert, please go to Alerts->Content Aware Alerts-> Create 



Add the type of event you need to create the alerts for, select the policy that you created, select which admins need to get the alerts and select the entities /groups/computer/users that you'd like to apply to.

Looking forward to your response.
