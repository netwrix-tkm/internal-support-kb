Customer was previously having 50 licenses. Recently, they purchased 100 more. 
The total should be 150 licenses in total. But there server is showing only 100. 

I have attached a screenshot of the licensing page from the console. It also contains server ID for your reference. 

Customer Name: Trusting Social (VN)

Please assist me with this. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","Case resolved, case close upon customer reuest.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","4.8","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2024-07-31T10:43:07.000Z","2024-08-05T06:51:47.000Z"
