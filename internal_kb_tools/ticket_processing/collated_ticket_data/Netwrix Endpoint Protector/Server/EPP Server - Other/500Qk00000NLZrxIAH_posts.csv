The console port and client ports communicate on port 443. 

Is there any chance for me to separate them? For example, I want to use 443 when accessing the console, but I want to use a different port when the clients communicate with the server.

Can you tell me how to do it?

Best regards","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T12:26:21.000Z"

We encountered a problem with the tests initially but after going to the sysctl.conf from /etc/sysctl.conf we added net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 and tested again.

Client was successfully able to connect","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-08T10:49:17.000Z"
