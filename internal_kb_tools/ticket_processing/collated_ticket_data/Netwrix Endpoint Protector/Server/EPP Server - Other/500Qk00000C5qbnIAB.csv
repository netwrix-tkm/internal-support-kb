"500Qk00000C5qbnIAB","00412509","Support Ticket","Unable to login to EPP console","All users that we try are getting an invalid username or password error when we try to login to our EPP console. We've triple checked user credentials. Unsure what changed. I've had someone from our Identity team check logs but there is nothing obviously wrong. 

Once that issue is resolved, perhaps you can help with a 2nd issue which was the reason we were trying to login to EPP today. We are investigating our options for moving the AD sync on EPP to LDAPS. Is this possible?","","","","AD sync recreated","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","11.1","Closed - Resolved","Quad Graphics","Jacob Edwards","2024-06-20T18:52:39.000Z","2024-07-01T21:14:04.000Z"
