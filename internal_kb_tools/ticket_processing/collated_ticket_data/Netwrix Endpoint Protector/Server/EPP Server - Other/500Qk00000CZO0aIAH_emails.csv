I would like to perform my own troubleshooting steps on the EPP server back end.  For this I need access to the backend via SSH.  Netwrix support are aware of my proficiency with regards to maintaining ngnix.conf files (that get changed when generating certificates and stop the ngnix server from starting).

Thanks
