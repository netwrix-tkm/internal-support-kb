"500Qk00000N9H9GIAV","00439515","Support Ticket","Incident logs issue","We are encountering an issue while generating reports in Endpoint Protector, where the server-end timing and client-end timing are mismatched.","","IMPORTANT!!!!
reply only to Palvannan, as a user who is in their shared mailbox is blocked from receiving emails and they don't want to modify that

called the customer and asked him to whitelist our email address so we can communicate on the ticket

27.03
- called the customer again
- they are still working on whitelisting our email address

437349 - server client upgrade

03.04
- their server's time is set to EST, they are checking the user's timezone
- asked them to always check the client's time on the logs page
- they complained about the mysql service
- asked them for a remote session


7.04
- connected with the customer and asked them to trigger a CAP policy
- the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly
- their main concern is that they are receiving emails from @secureview.com, to ""siemalert"" address, in which events are reported, but that these events are not also showing up in the Content Aware Report
- I asked them to set the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.","- waiting on the customer

7.04

-told them to monitor if they receive any email regarding the threat that we triggered during our session, and to check the configuration of the SIEM server that they are having on their side.","The difference regarding Date/Time between Server and Client time is justifiable as the server time is set to a different time zone as the time that is set on the computer which has the client installed.","Best Practices Question","Alin Anca","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","35.8","Closed - Resolved","AGS Health Inc.","Mahesh P","2025-03-20T16:11:00.000Z","2025-04-25T11:19:08.000Z"
