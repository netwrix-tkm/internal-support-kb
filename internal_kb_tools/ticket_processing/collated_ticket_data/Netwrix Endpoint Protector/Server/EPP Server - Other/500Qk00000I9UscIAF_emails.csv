Hello Daniel,

Thank you for your reply.

I'm not available but one of my colleague can assist with this. We can schedule a remote session at 1:30 PM Turkey time.

Let me make an addition to the case. Turkey do not practice daylight saving time. I believe this issue started occurring at the end of October because of this.

Hello Daniel, 
Hello,

During the meeting, you made adjustments by connecting to the server via SSH, but the issue was not resolved. Later, we configured it as Moscow. You mentioned that you would consult a different team about this issue and get back to us. Is there any update?
