Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we discussed:
- there are  about 10+ computers that cannot be located that still communicate with the EPP server
- we setup User Remediation for USB devices with a custom notification
- in about 7 days the EPP server will be shut down from your end

We will leave this ticket open for about 1 more week in case you have any questions along the way.
