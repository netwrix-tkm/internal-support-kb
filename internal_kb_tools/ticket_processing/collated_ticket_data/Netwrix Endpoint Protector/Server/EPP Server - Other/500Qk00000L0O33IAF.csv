"500Qk00000L0O33IAF","00433404","Support Ticket","Server Migration licensing question","Hello,

We are preparing to upgrade our Endpoint Protector server and are planning to set up a new server and migrate all of our user/group data over to the new server. However, we are concerned about how the licensing would work while migrating data as that would technically require running two servers simultaneously during the migration. 

Is this something that is currently supported by our licensing or do we need to request some kind of temporary license to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Easton","","","Waiting on Customer.","1. Finished setting up the new EPP server.
2. Activating the Trial license from System Configuration -> System Licensing -> Trial(30 days).
3. Importing the System Backup v2 to the new EPP server.
4. Upgrading the EPP server from 5940 to 5941.
5. Swapped the IP from the old EPP to the new one so the EPP clients will connect to the new server.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","31.9","Closed - Resolved","NBC Universal","Easton Lindauer","2025-01-23T21:35:04.000Z","2025-02-24T19:53:57.000Z"
