Unfortunately you can not get a list with all the machines were the USB Storage Devices are allowed.

As a workaround for this, you can create an export with the effective rights for all the computers and check the rights set for the USB Storage Devices.

In order to create the Effective rights report you will have to access Dashboard -> Effective Rights -> For the Device Type you will have to select the USB Storage Devices

This report will show all the computers and their rights set for the USB Storage devices.
Also it will show the specific USB Storage Devices which were allowed for the computers. 

Best regards,
Emil
