In future any of FR should be raised only in Product Boards.
Request refused, as we have already such functionality in webUI: please refer to user manual: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemConfiguration/SecurityAndSettings.htm#advanced_user_password_settings

Based on that System Security ->  Advanced User Password Settings  where they can Enforce Complex Password and set the Minimum password length is configurable.
