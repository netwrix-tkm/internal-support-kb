Currently, we are using the UTC+8 time zone. If the government decides to adopt daylight saving time, how should we configure the change related to the time zone? Will we handle this change ourselves, or will you be responsible for it?","","The Government of Mongolia is considering changing the time zone to implement daylight saving time and the customer wanted to know that If the government decides to adopt daylight saving time what action they need to take to align their EPP server to have the correct time.","This answer was provided to the customer:
