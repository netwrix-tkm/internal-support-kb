@Krzysztof Staszalek Reviewed by Jeremy and I:

Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus
 these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can 
migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. Netwrix is aware of the 
out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is 
actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported 
version of PHP. We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur 
within 4 months.
