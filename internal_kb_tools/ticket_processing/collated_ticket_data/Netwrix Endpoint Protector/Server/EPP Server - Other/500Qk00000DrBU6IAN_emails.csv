Hello Denni,

Thank you for you patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our Engineering team to inform the customer that deleting shadows from the server will impact the UI. The download button will still appear on the UI if the shadow is manually removed from the server.

If the customer really wants to delete the shadows from the backend of the server, then we should schedule a meeting in order to do so.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
