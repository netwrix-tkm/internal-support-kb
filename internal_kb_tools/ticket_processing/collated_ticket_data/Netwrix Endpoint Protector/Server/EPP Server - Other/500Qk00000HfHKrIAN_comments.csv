@WaitingOnEngineer

This was replicated on Windows 11 (on windows 10 eveything works as expected).


!!! this is a very important information which was NOT wrote in ticket

A ticket was linked with this item which will solve the problem. Until the PM will schedule the ticket for a release a workaround solution can be used.
 @Krzysztof Staszalek

Workaround: set denylist application

Denylists and Allowlist -> Denylists -> Applications -> Add

Application & CLI Command: SnippingTool
Parameters: *

Check in right panel and click on Generate.

Can you please schedule a remote connection? This case has been open for a while, and I think it would be easier to jump on a call to better understand the scenarios.

This case was tested in remote connection and the solution worked as expected.
(in remote connection the print screen was blocked)

What they changed?
Can you please check in logs?

The customer didn't change anything on the EPP side. There is another process that is opening the screenshot function called ScreenSkatch.exe 
We have tried to block this as before by adding it to the denylist, without success. 
From my search this process is part of another process that has multiple functionalities.
A set logs has been added also a screenshot.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-01-31T09:08:09.000Z","2025-01-31T09:08:09.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer
A bug was discovered while testing this issue, and the customer is correct that the screenshot is NOT blocked (it works).

Until we fix the issue, please add the following executables to the application denylist:
ScreenSketch.exe *

ScreenClippingHost.exe"" *
GameBar.exe *

!! All the time please add the * like arguments.

Please test with the mentioned process names.
