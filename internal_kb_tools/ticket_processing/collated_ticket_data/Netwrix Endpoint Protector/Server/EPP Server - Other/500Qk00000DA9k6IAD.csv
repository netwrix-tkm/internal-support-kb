"500Qk00000DA9k6IAD","00415187","Support Ticket","Vulnerability","The issue was regarding an email my supervisor received (below).  We have Netwrix Auditor 10.5.10977 and we have CoSoSys Endpoint Protector which is weird because I didn’t know Netwrix owns this Endpoint Protector.  The agents for Endpoint Protector are 5.8.4.1 and the server is version 5.7.1.0.  We don’t own the server on-prem.  I wanted to know if we need to upgrade from our end with either Netwrix Auditor or Endpoint Protector.","","","","Closing - answered customer's inquiries.","","Cristian Tornea","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","219.1","Closed - Resolved","Fort Defiance Indian Hospital","Sterling Morris","2024-07-16T20:34:37.000Z","2025-02-20T22:32:32.000Z"
