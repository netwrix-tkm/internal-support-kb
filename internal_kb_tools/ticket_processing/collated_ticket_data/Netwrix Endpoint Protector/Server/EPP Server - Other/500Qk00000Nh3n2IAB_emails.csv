All the computers which will match the naming convention set in the smart group will be included in the smart group.
You can verify if the rights are correctly set for the computers accessing Dashboard -> Effective Rights -> generate a report for one of the computers which matches the naming convention of the smart group.
Let me know if you would like to schedule a Zoom meeting in order to discuss more about this.

Best regards,
Emil
