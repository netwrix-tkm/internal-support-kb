Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad
experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are
requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the
previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.




Thanks and Best regards

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.

Hi Team,

As discussed in the zoom call. I have checked with my colleague and got the
.pem extension certificate. And uploaded the certs on the respective text
boxes. After a minute the console refreshed but it still remains
the same(Insecure).

What to do next? Should i have to give some time?

Thanks and Best regards

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have added the .crt file and key.crt to the EPP server, without any effect. 

We also discuss to check with your colleagues regarding the .pem files, which didn't help. 

After you refresh the page have you notice any errors on the certificate ?

Can you open it and check what is the error message displayed ? 

Could you please provide us a screenshot with the certificate from the EPP console page? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.




Thanks and Best regards

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The certificate used is not a valid one, as you can see in the screenshot with the expiration date (18 february 2024) . 

Can you please discuss with your colleagues and generate a new certificate, then import it into the EPP web UI ? 

Check if with the new certificate the issue persist.

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Naga, 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have added the .crt file and key.crt to the EPP server, without any effect. 

We also discuss to check with your colleagues regarding the .pem files, which didn't help. 

After you refresh the page have you notice any errors on the certificate ?

Can you open it and check what is the error message displayed ? 

Could you please provide us a screenshot with the certificate from the EPP console page? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Team,

As discussed in the zoom call. I have checked with my colleague and got the .pem extension certificate. And uploaded the certs on the respective text boxes. After a minute the console refreshed but it still remains the same(Insecure).

What to do next? Should i have to give some time?
 



Thanks and Best regards

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The certificate used is not a valid one, as you can see in the screenshot with the expiration date (18 february 2024) . 

Can you please discuss with your colleagues and generate a new certificate, then import it into the EPP web UI ? 

Check if with the new certificate the issue persist.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Naga, 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have added the .crt file and key.crt to the EPP server, without any effect. 

We also discuss to check with your colleagues regarding the .pem files, which didn't help. 

After you refresh the page have you notice any errors on the certificate ?

Can you open it and check what is the error message displayed ? 

Could you please provide us a screenshot with the certificate from the EPP console page? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Team,

As discussed in the zoom call. I have checked with my colleague and got the .pem extension certificate. And uploaded the certs on the respective text boxes. After a minute the console refreshed but it still remains the same(Insecure).

What to do next? Should i have to give some time?
 



Thanks and Best regards

Yes, I have the certificates (.key and .crt) in my folder. We had a bad experience previously with certificates. That's the reason we are requesting a remote session, but I didn't expect that I missed some of the previous sessions.

I will be available at this time: 20-06-2024 16:00 IST.

Hello Naga,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Before scheduling another session, could you please let us know if you have a self signed certificate ? 

Also, have you tried to add the Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.
Important, you have to include the BEGIN and END directives of the body and private key.



Looking forward for your response.
