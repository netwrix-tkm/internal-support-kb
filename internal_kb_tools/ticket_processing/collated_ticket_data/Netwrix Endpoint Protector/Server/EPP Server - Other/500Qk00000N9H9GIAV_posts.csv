- connected with the customer and asked them to trigger a CAP policy
- the scenario was to upload a TIFF file over MS Teams, and this was blocked accordingly
- their main concern is that they are receiving emails from @secureview.com, to ""siemalert"" address, in which events are reported, but that these events are not also showing up in the Content Aware Report
- I asked them to set the time of the computer to ET. and after that both Client and Server time were the same.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-04-07T12:50:55.000Z"
