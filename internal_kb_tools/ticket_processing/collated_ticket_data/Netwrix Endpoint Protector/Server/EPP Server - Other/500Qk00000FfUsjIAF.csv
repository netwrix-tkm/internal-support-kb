Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that they've run out of licenses and have a few questions:
1) If the client is unlicensed, could it be the reason that this Computer in the Computer list has no username and status ""offline"" (even if this PC actually online)?
2)If there is no free license, how the EPP client behavior change on the endpoint?
Will the CAP policy stop working?
Because for some reason, on the one EPP client, instead of ""block and remediate"" action it changed to ""Block only"".
After CAP policy blocked the file transfer there appeared ""Block"" notification pop-up instead of Remediation, and also no report was sent to the server.","","","","Solved with the latest agents","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","61.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-12T11:46:36.000Z","2024-11-12T12:38:29.000Z"
