We're trying to set up external storage on our EPP installation and keep getting an error message that it cannot connect to the share we've made available.

However, a check of the firewall logs shows that the EPP Server doesn't make any connections at all when testing this.

The share settings are correct and have been checked using other devices on the network. The EPP Server is able to connect successfully to our AD and to our Mailserver but not to the fileshare.

I feel that we've missed some deeper configuration on the EPP Server but am at a loss as to what that could be. Any help would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,

Matt","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-12T08:59:01.000Z"

Connected remote with the client to assist further with the case.
Went on the SSH and did a ping to the shared drive and it was connecting.
What the problem was after doing some change in the settings was the fact that the intial username Matt used was wrong. After correcting that, we tested again and it was working.
In the shared drive folder where he mounted the backups, the 3 folders were generated successfully.
Closing ticket as resolved.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-19T14:23:55.000Z"
