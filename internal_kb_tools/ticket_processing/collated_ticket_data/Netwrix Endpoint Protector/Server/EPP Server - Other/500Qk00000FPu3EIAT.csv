We are looking into removing the EPP Client from the system tray in both Windows&Mac. We have set the Client Mode from Global Settings to Hidden icon, however after a restart it seems like the icon of the Client is still present. Could you please let us know how we can get the icon to stop displaying to the users?

Thank you.","","","","The issue was caused by some custom rights for specific computers.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","66.2","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Denis Pasca","2024-09-06T13:34:08.000Z","2024-11-11T17:55:23.000Z"
