We are working on a tender file for a 10K+ users company. Could you please help us with the following questions?
1. It must be compatible at least with OAuth 2.0 authentication flows:
* Client Credentials
* Authorization Code
* Authorization Code + PKCE
* Resource Owner
Specify which ones.
2. Integration with SOAR platforms.
3. It must have a user management module, for cases where it is integrated with external Identity Providers
(unlocking users and changing passwords, user administration)
4. The solution must consider the use of the ""SCOPE"" attribute within the JWT, when the integration is done via OAuth.
Provide evidence of the swagger contract for some example API.
5. The solution must provide API, topical, or integration services that facilitate user integration into the information hosted in the SaaS service.
Specify how this is facilitated.
6. The solution must have the ability to isolate service and data from other clients of the service provider.
Indicate whether it is Single Tenant or Multitenant.
Detail the scheme for segregation and isolation of the service between clients
7. The vendor must have a process and procedure for managing security incidents.
Provide a policy or documentation that supports its existence.
8. Following a security/fraud incident (post-mortem), the provider must provide the facility for BCP staff to initiate a forensic investigation.
Indicate whether due diligence is feasible, and whether this can be contractually specified if necessary.
Must provide the procedure and SLA for care.
9. Data at rest must be encrypted with robust algorithms.
Please specify which algorithms and/or Cipher Suite are supported or compatible.
At a minimum:
AES256, RSA2048, etc.
10. The solution must support security through certificates (Mutual Authentication).
It must support a certificate issued by a third-party company, e.g. Global Sign.
11. It must support the TLS 1.2 protocol or higher, using robust algorithms to secure the channel.
At the information transport level, the information must be encrypted, both when sending information from the client to the provider, as well as from the provider to the client.
12. The SaaS solution must allow the use of a secure private VPN/MPLS channel.
If data needs to be moved or transferred, a secure mechanism and protocol must be used to exchange information between the Bank and the SaaS solution.
13. The SaaS solution must allow generating Whitelist through its perimeter solution or WAF, with the bank's IPs.
14. The solution must include security controls and tools at the network and infrastructure level that minimize the risk of intrusive attacks that could compromise the client/bank's information.
Indicate what technologies and/or mechanisms are contemplated (e.g. firewalls, ips, waf, etc.)

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-22T13:29:22.000Z"
