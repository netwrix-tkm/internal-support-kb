we are naval group, builder of boat and submarine for milirary and usind epp in our boat ,

I have a question about the EndPoint Protector v5.2.0.7 version installed on our BARRACUDA program equipment.
As a reminder, the EPP VM is hosted on a Windows Server 2008 and the clients are installed on Windows XP PosReady OS.

We need to ensure that in the near future, all our software installations remain functional, and that no expired certificates affect the smooth running of the whole system.
 
To do this, we modified the BIOS date of all our equipment, and for our test we set the date to 01/01/2040.

Following a reboot, we found that access to the Web management interface was no longer possible, and an error message was displayed with the EndpointProtector logo:
Reporting an Administrations Tool.
“Oops! An error occured!
“The server returned a “500 Internal Server Error!

For the record, we carried out this test without activating the EPP license, so as not to risk being blocked when it expired.

Can you tell us if EPP uses Windows certificates, and if so, which ones?
What's the procedure for getting around the problem and ensuring that the system remains operational by 2040?
