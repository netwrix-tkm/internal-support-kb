We have also uploaded the SSL certificate on the EPP server and after that it was secure.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","2.2","Closed - Resolved","AconSeg","Mariano Amigo","2025-03-11T15:14:45.000Z","2025-03-13T18:57:13.000Z"
