Thank you for reaching out!

The way we are calculating the retention is in size of the logs.
For example - 5 logs would have approximatively 1KB while 5000 logs would have 1MB.
Please note that the size might vary from log to log but this are some general values that we use in our testing in order to determine retention of logs on the EPP client.
The reason for which we cannot provide you values based on period of time regarding retention and we prefer doing it in MB is because, retention in time represents a too hard to guess variable as it really depends on how much logs each users/customer performs/each day.


Regarding the second question,  we are sending only syslog files to the SIEM application.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Good day!
Quick question, does the current EPP Server support RHEL 8.3 ?

If yes, can we get the RHEL 8.3 client with the dependencies together ?

Thank you!

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Here is the RHEL 8.3 client 
https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPClient_v1.8.0.0/EPPClient_RedHatEnterprise_8.3_1805_x86_64.tar.gz

Since this is an old OS and client we strongly recommend to the customer to upgrade them, so we can provide our latest client version .

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Good day!
We have no further question on this as of now.
Please close this ticket.
We will log a new ticket if we need a different version of RHEL's client.

Thank you!
