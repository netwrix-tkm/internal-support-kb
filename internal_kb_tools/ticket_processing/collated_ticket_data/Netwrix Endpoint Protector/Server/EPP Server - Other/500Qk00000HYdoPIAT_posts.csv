Customer name is PrivatBank.
Recently, Ukraine changed time zone to GMT+2 and now all time on the EPP server is seems like GMT+3.
For example, the current time is 12:43, but on the server last seen 13:43.
Could we please schedule the remote session to correct the server time?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-28T10:47:26.000Z"
