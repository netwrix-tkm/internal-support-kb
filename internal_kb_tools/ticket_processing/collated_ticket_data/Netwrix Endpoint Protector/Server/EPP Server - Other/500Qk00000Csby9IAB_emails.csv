Thank you contacting our Support Department.


In order to add a SSL Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.
Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated (certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.


Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
