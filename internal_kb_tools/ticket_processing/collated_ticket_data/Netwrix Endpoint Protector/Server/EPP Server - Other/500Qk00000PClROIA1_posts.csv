Since May 10, 2025, log reports are no longer advised in the Unify server console!

Expectation:
- Please review and resolve the issue.
- The retrieval of all log reports on the console must be restored and made possible!

Hint:
Communication between EPP client and server is functional!

Thanks for a quick intervention in advance!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-15T15:47:55.000Z"

- Log reports created after May 10, 2025, are not being displayed in the Unify server console.
- Communication between the EPP client and server is working as expected.
- Initial investigation revealed that logs are being stored in Redis but are not processed due to the memory threshold being reached.
- No logs have been lost; they remain stored in Redis.
- The root cause appears related to memory usage and batch log processing limitations.
- Further investigation is required to address the memory threshold issue and restore normal log processing.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-19T08:43:35.000Z"

1. R&D team to further investigate the root cause of the memory threshold being reached in Redis.
2. Analyze and optimize memory usage and batch log processing on the Unify server.
3. Implement necessary fixes or configuration changes to allow logs to be processed and displayed in the console.
4. Update the customer with progress and estimated resolution timeline.
5. Confirm with the customer once log report visibility is restored.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-19T08:43:56.000Z"
