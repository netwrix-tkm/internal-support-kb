Failed tests when filtering Unlicensed and Offline Computers:
- selecting Select all entries + Delete
- manually selecting 10+ computers + delete

What worked:
- manually selecting 9 or less computers + delete -> worked
- when we had less than 9 computers and we selected all entries + delete -> it worked

• What is the impact of the problem on your business?
Low, except for the visual pollution of machines that have several options to choose from the same equipment, when we want to apply a rule, we do not know which machine is active. And this is hindering management.

• Have you tried any troubleshooting steps? If so, what did you try?
No, I can't imagine what steps there might be for this...
We tested in other browsers and the problem repeats itself.

• When did this problem start?
I don't know, we tried to delete the machines today, and we couldn't. In previous versions we have already deleted machines and had no problems.

Customer filtered the machines yet when he  tries to delete multiple machines, he can't, there's no result, even after waiting for hours...

If customer uses filter and select just 1, it is deleted normally.

- Gave R&D the requested information:
* What ""failed tests"" exactly means?

Customer able to delete computers less then 10 at a time.

Customer not able to delete more then 10 computers at a time when selected.

* Is there any error displayed on the UI or in the request response after using the delete action?

The UI displays a message stating that the Delete successfully started. Yet the computers do not delete as expected.
df -
* If not then is possible that an error message will be displayed if you access again Device Control -> Computers after using the delete action.

No error messages seen from here

* Does the UI get stuck after using the delete action? The UI displays a message stating that the Delete successfully started.

* How many computers does the customer wants to delete? Customer wants to delete 47 computers at one time

* We need the output of the following query from db to see what process is used when deleting with checked select all entries option:

--- CODE ---
select value from parameter where name = 'limit_select_all_action';
--- CODE ---

Results:
mysql> select value from parameter where name = 'limit_select_all_action';
