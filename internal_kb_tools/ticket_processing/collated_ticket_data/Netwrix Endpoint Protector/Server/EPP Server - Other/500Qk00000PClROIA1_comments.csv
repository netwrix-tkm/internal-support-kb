We have been investigating this issue and found that the logs are not processed from Redis due to the memory threshold being reached. All logs remain stored in Redis and are not lost. 

To prevent this from happening, we need to further investigate the root cause and improve memory usage and batch logs processing.

@WaitingOnEngineer

This issue was solved during yesterday's remote connection. Please ask the client to check if the logs from 2025-05-10 until the current date are displayed in the UI. And today we had a follow-up remote connection to check if the system is stable.

The root cause was the scanning mechanism of Redis keys, which in some cases consumed too much memory trying look for specific data entries. Over time this built memory usage and the creation of database snapshots to prevent data loss. 

We adjusted the way Redis searches through data so it can stop sooner and handle these situations more efficiently.

The customer has replied:

at the moment it looks fine from our side. But I cannot say whether all logs generated since May 10th are actually available.
The total number of Logs report from 2025-05-10 00:00:00 to 2025-05-21 00:00:00 is 24653239 entries at the Unify server console.
You may be able to verify the number from your side.

Can we please have a look together?

@WaitingOnEngineer

We can't say exactly how many logs should be available since May 10th. But we can confirm that all logs were processed from Redis on both EPP nodes connected in Unify.
