Hi Flaviu,

Please verify on the backend if the WIN agents are available in the software directory. (/EPPServer/sieratool/web/software).


If they are, check the file permissions and ownership.
The expected owner should be www-data:www-data with permissions set to 755.


If they are missing, please inject them on the server and pay attention to the agents' versions. 


If the problem is not solved doing the above steps, please provide some screenshots with the content of the software director and the result of the next query:



--- CODE ---
SELECT * FROM clientsoftware WHERE isdefault = 1;

--- CODE ---





Regards,
Augustina

Please explain how we can inject the EPP clients. Is it done through an Offline patch? and if so please provide it to us.

Thank you!

Please provide me at least the Offline Client patch so we can upload it to the EPP server.

Hi Flaviu,

Please give me more context about how the migration was done.

Does the customer use custom agents?
