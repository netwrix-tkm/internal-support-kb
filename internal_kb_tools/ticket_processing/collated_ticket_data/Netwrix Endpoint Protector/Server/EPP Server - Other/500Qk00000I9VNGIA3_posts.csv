today I discovered that a new installed client does not get a license (yes there are free licenses on the server). While checking different thing on the server I also discovered that the ""Last seen"" for example for my client display ""2024-10-14"".
I feel a bit uncomfortabe about this and would like to know, how we could fix that.
