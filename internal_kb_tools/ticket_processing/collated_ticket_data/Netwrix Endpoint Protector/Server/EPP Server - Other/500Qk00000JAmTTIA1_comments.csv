@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan we can modify it to start but the moment that they modify the networking settings or do a certificate regeneration this will break again. If they want a permanent fix, this is a feature request, rather than a support request.

Hi Andrei,

Please see below the feedback from DevOps:
""We can modify it to start but the moment that they modify the networking settings or do a certificate regeneration this will break again. If they want a permanent fix, this is a feature request, rather than a support request.

Based on this, please raise a feature request on the Product Board.

Thank you,

Hi Andrei,

Would it be possible to schedule this when Catalin is back from PTO, after the 30th of December as we would need his input here.

Thank you,

Bogdan
