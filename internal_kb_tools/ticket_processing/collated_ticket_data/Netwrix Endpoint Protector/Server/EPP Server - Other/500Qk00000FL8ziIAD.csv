"500Qk00000FL8ziIAD","00420072","Support Ticket","Issue with DLP and Secure Web Gateway Proxy Interference","We are currently testing a Secure Web Gateway (SWG) add-on for our VPN, which enables a transparent proxy on our macOS devices, similar to the proxy used by EPP. The SWG inspects web traffic and compares it against a real-time updated list of malicious sites.

During our testing, we noticed that our endpoint DLP solution stopped inspecting traffic once the SWG was enabled. Our VPN provider suggested creating a bypass rule for the EPP service (com.cososys.eppclient) so that the SWG would bypass traffic originating from the DLP. After implementing this bypass, the DLP tool began working as expected again and resumed inspecting traffic. However, the SWG tool is now unable to filter or inspect the same traffic, as it is bypassed.

We are looking for a solution where both tools (DLP and SWG) can inspect traffic simultaneously, allowing both proxies to function without interfering with each other. Do you have any recommendations or workarounds that would allow both services to work together effectively? How have other customers with multiple proxies on macOS configured this kind of setup? Is there anything we can do on the EPP side to resolve this?
