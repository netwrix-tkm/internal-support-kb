Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hi,

 

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have received an update from our Engineering team that you will have to remove the URL category that you have added there, because when URL category is enabled only on requested URL the content will be scanned.

Could you please remove the URL, save, update the policies on the client and try again.

Regarding the displayed logs can you share with us a few screenshots ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

In the report and analysis, content aware reports you should have the show drop menu, where you can select all. 

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Hi Daniel,

 

We have another query on the content aware reports, the maximum results displayed are 200 which gets limited to a span of 2 hours, how do we expand that limit and extract the full months logs?

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

 

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have received an update from our Engineering team that you will have to remove the URL category that you have added there, because when URL category is enabled only on requested URL the content will be scanned.

Could you please remove the URL, save, update the policies on the client and try again.

Regarding the displayed logs can you share with us a few screenshots ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

We have another query on the content aware reports, the maximum results displayed are 200 which gets limited to a span of 2 hours, how do we expand that limit and extract the full months logs?

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

 

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have received an update from our Engineering team that you will have to remove the URL category that you have added there, because when URL category is enabled only on requested URL the content will be scanned.

Could you please remove the URL, save, update the policies on the client and try again.

Regarding the displayed logs can you share with us a few screenshots ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi,

 

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have received an update from our Engineering team that you will have to remove the URL category that you have added there, because when URL category is enabled only on requested URL the content will be scanned.

Could you please remove the URL, save, update the policies on the client and try again.

Regarding the displayed logs can you share with us a few screenshots ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

In the report and analysis, content aware reports you should have the show drop menu, where you can select all. 

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Hi Daniel,

 

We have another query on the content aware reports, the maximum results displayed are 200 which gets limited to a span of 2 hours, how do we expand that limit and extract the full months logs?

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your prompt response.

Have you tried to remove the dates? 

Do you have more logs? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hi,

 

Find below screenshot. We have asked for the logs of 2 days and we only get 200 results which spans hardly 2 hours. However if we reduce the date we can see there are logs for the earlier time as well.

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have received an update from our Engineering team that you will have to remove the URL category that you have added there, because when URL category is enabled only on requested URL the content will be scanned.

Could you please remove the URL, save, update the policies on the client and try again.

Regarding the displayed logs can you share with us a few screenshots ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

In the report and analysis, content aware reports you should have the show drop menu, where you can select all. 

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

We have another query on the content aware reports, the maximum results displayed are 200 which gets limited to a span of 2 hours, how do we expand that limit and extract the full months logs?

Alizain Patel

Hello Alizain,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have answered all the questions that you had and we tried to show an example of how the block and remediate action should but we couldn't block any files.

I will forward the request to our Engineering team for further analysis.

As soon as I receive an update from their side, I will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
