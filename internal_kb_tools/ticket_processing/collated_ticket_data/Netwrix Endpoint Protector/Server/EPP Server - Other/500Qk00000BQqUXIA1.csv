"500Qk00000BQqUXIA1","00410958","Support Ticket","Can we change the GUI login port to a different one than 443?","We have EPP-protected clients both on-campus and out in the wild. We note that the off-campus units do not operate properly unless they can communicate with the on-prem server. Unfortunately, this means we need to open port 443 to the world, which also exposes the admin login GUI to the world. Can we move the admin login to another port, even 444, which we won't expose to the world.","","","","Port separation completed during remote session","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","8.3","Closed - Resolved","Boston College","Pat Cain","2024-06-04T15:39:59.000Z","2024-06-12T22:09:35.000Z"
