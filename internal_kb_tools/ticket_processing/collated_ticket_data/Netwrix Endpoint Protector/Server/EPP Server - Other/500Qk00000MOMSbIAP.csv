- Customer recently used a security tool and found several vulnerabilities associated with EPP
- Sent customer email requesting confirmation of EPP version 5.9.4.0","Awaiting customer response","Customer had questions relating to the mysql version running and vulnerabilities associated with the version. Responded to customer with: Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. Netwrix is aware of the out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported version of PHP. We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur within 4 months.""","","Ramon Torres","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","5.9.4.1","25.8","Closed - Resolved","PROOF","Samantha Skinner","2025-02-27T21:09:00.000Z","2025-03-25T16:02:41.000Z"
