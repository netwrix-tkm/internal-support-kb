Please be aware that the EPP server is hosted in GCP on the customers side. Also the UI is not timing out, the issue is that the nginx service is not working(failed status). Also please share the /opt/aminetconfig.sh file as we do not have it.

Please let me knwo if we can have a remote session with the customer and a colleague from the dev team.

Thank you!
