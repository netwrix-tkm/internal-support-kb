I have checked internally with my colleagues and unfortunately we do not support Netapp storage devices for the EPP client.

We believe that it runs a proprietary OS called Ontap. It's not a flavor of Linux. Even the filesystem is proprietary.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide, or if we can close this ticket.

Please feel free to close this ticket out. I have informed the team that maintains the net app storage device that this will not be a viable solution for them.

Thank you,
