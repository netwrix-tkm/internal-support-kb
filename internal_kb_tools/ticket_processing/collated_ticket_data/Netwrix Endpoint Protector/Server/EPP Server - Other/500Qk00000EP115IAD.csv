Customer name is Privat Bank.
They showed us a display bug when Computers in Device Control, seems ""Licensed"" even after EPP automatically released license.
The automatic release license function is set to 3 days, but computers which was last online more than 3 days, are displaying like ""licensed"", but we checked these computers in the ""View license"" menu, and they actually have no licenses.
So, it's only displaying issue.
I will attach screenshots.","","","","fixed with 52 procedure","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","28.9","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-08-14T08:57:51.000Z","2024-09-12T07:12:12.000Z"
