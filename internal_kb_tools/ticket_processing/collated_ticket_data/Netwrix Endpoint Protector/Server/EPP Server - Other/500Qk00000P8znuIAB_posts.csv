The customer was getting an overwhelming amount of DPI bypass events logs under ""Report and Analysis"" > "" Content Aware Report"".  They also stated that is Deep Packet Inspection with DPI Bypass is turned on then EPP is not able to enforce the CAP policy however this is not the case we we observed in the remote session that EPP still works as expected by enforcing CAP even with DPI Bypass turned.  To eliminate the noise with the setting turned on we showed the customer in the remote session where to turn off the event logs for DPI Bypass, we turned off the setting ""DPI Bypass Event Logging"".","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-05-20T13:47:29.000Z"

The customer will test the same settings on other endpoints and observe if EPP works as expected on those computers as well.  We are now waiting on an update from the customer.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-05-20T13:49:04.000Z"
