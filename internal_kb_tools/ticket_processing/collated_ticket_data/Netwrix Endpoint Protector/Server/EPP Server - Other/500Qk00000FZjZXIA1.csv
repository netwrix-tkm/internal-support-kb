"500Qk00000FZjZXIA1","00420579","Support Ticket","Questions - License recovery and deleting unlicensed computers","1.  If I configure “Automatic Release License” to recover licenses from computers that have not checked in for 90 days, is there a way to have the computers removed from the EPP inventory as well or do I have to go to Device Control >> Computers and filter out all Unlicensed computers that have not checked in over 90 days and delete them?

2.  Why does EPP keep an inventory of clients that are Unlicensed?  What is the reasoning behind that?  What happens if I go to Device Control >> Computers and filter out all Unlicensed computers and delete them?  Will those computers be issued a new license if the checks back in?
