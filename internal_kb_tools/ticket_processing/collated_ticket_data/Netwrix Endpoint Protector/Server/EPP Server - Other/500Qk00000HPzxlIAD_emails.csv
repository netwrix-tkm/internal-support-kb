Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up
notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way
to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact
the agent's communication with the server?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Best regards,

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings
within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops
working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on
new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the
issue.

Please take a look.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen
where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my
Slack status appears as offline.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,
Just observed that the slack messages loading slow on macbook and the slack status shows as offline where the EPP agent is running.
How do we fix this?

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,
Just observed that the slack messages loading slow on macbook and the slack status shows as offline where the EPP agent is running.
How do we fix this?

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Unfortunately, we could not investigate the issue as the trial licenses are expired. I will add my colleague Vlad to this email thread to assist you with a trial license extension so that we can continue the troubleshooting process.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Hello,

Thank you for making time to join today.
Unfortunately, we could not investigate the issue as the trial licenses are expired. I will add my colleague Vlad to this email thread to assist you with a trial license extension so that we can continue the troubleshooting process.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Best regards,

Unfortunately, we could not investigate the issue as the trial licenses are expired. I will add my colleague Vlad to this email thread to assist you with a trial license extension so that we can continue the troubleshooting process.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Hello Team,
Just observed that the slack messages loading slow on macbook and the slack status shows as offline where the EPP agent is running.
How do we fix this?

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Hello,

Thank you for making time to join today.
Unfortunately, we could not investigate the issue as the trial licenses are expired. I will add my colleague Vlad to this email thread to assist you with a trial license extension so that we can continue the troubleshooting process.

Additionally, I constantly see the following message on my Slack screen where the EPP agents are running. Also, for others in my organization, my Slack status appears as offline.

Hi Alin,

We’ve already added the required steps in the System Extension settings within Jamf, but the issue persists as I mentioned in my previous email.

After installing the EPP agent on endpoints, the Slack app either stops working or loads very slowly. This is preventing users from catching up on new messages in real time, which is critical for us.

I confirmed that unchecking Slack in the Content Aware policy resolves the issue.

Please take a look.

Just observed that the slack messages loading slow on macbook and the slack status shows as offline where the EPP agent is running.
How do we fix this?

Hello Team,

Quick question:

After installing EPP clients through JAMF, we’re seeing two pop-up notifications (attached below) that require user permission. Is there a way to automate these approvals using JAMF?

Additionally, if a user ignores or doesn’t allow them, could this impact the agent's communication with the server?

Hi Alin,

Thanks for your support!

The agent deployment through JAMF was successful after updating the script, and we tested it on a few other laptops as well.

Quick question—We're using the ScaleFusion MDM solution to manage our Windows devices. However, when we tried pushing the Endpoint Protector through ScaleFusion, we encountered the same server communication issue we faced with JAMF.

Would a script be required for Windows deployment as well? If you have any documentation on deploying the Windows agent via MDM, could you please share it?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I had the meeting with Rajesh Kumar and the issue was resolved in that session, I was waiting for him to get back to me after he deployed it for 2-3 other computers.
Please see the last email communication below:
We tried the deployment with a different script and it worked as expected, the EPP client is now communicating with the server.
Please let me know after you test it out for some other computer if everything is fine and we can close the ticket.

Best regards,

Hi Vlad/Alin,

It has been a week, and we have not seen any progress on the
implementation. Additionally, I haven’t received any response yet from your
side regarding the current status.

We are concerned that our time is being wasted with Satcom Infotech and
Sonata Software on this matter. Could you please provide an update on where
we stand with the license loading part?

This delay and lack of communication were not anticipated when we started,
and it’s prompting us to reconsider our partnership for the upcoming year.

Looking forward to your prompt response!
