As per Our Audit Requirements, we need to configure DLP polices in ""Report & Block"" Mode with Alert Notifications to end user in the event of File Transfer / Copy / Delete & Print operation. right now, DLP is configured in ""Report only Mode"" 

We need more understanding & recommendations from your side on what features are available DLP that we can utilize to comply with our audit requirements

Regards,
Arsalan Khan","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-14T10:16:38.000Z"

- showed the customer how to create custom templates for CAP notifications
