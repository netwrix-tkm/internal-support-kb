Please investigate and resolve the issue.","","our customer 'Mordor Intelligence Pvt. Ltd.' reported an issue whereby their Content Aware Protection policy becomes ineffective when they turn on Browsec VPN.
The Browsec VPN is installed directly into the web browser ""Chrome"" as a plugin.
They have configured a CAP policy to block the domain ""mail.google.com"". The CAP Policy works fine when the Browsec VPN is not enabled however as soon as the VPN is enabled within the web browser then it overrides the EPP SSL Certificate and as a result DPI becomes ineffective.

Customer confirmed that Endpoint Protector is now working as expected after adding port 1022. This case can be closed now.","This case can be closed now.","Customer confirmed that Endpoint Protector is now working as expected after adding port 1022.
