- 	Please specify the server version.
	 - 	Has the Agent successfully communicated with the server at any point?
	 - 	 Check if the config file is not corrupted: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml (In the backend procedure you can find how this file should look;)

	 - 	Check if any custom certificate is used.

	 - 	 Check if Increased Communication Security is enabled, and disable it. (Appliance -> Server Maintenance page, Increased Communication Security section.)
	 - 	
 If the comunication isn't established:

	 - 	

Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack.



	 - 	
If comunication is established, and the customer uses a UI certificate, please advise him to upload the UI certificate again.

- Please specify the server version. -> 5.9.4.0
- Has the Agent successfully communicated with the server at any point? -> it appears as Last Seen correctly, I also released the license, and it was assigned again to the computer.

-  Check if the config file is not corrupted: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml (In the backend procedure you can find how this file should look;) -> Checked it, it looks fine, please see screenshots ""epp yml config 1"" and ""epp yml config 2"".

- Check if any custom certificate is used.

-  Check if Increased Communication Security is enabled, and disable it. (Appliance -> Server Maintenance page, Increased Communication Security section.)

-> for both of them, No. Please see the screenshot ""No Increased communication - No custom certificate""

 If the communication isn't established:

- Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack.

-> The server certificate stack regeneration did not bring any improvement.

Please also see the screenshots ""Last server connection - client side"" and ""Last seen - Computer list"".","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-10-11T08:35:05.000Z","2024-10-11T08:35:05.000Z","false","false"
