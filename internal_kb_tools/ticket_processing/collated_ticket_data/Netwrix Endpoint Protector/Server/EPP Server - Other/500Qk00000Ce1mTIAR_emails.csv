Hi,

Thanks for the update! I was in a workshop after the extended holiday and today is my first day back in the office. Have there been any changes of the last few days?

I'm including Brad on this email trail - it looks like the server synchronization is still taking place daily, but it is not updating the membership counts from within the console.

Thanks!

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

We would like to do the below steps together with you in a remote session.

As a first step, we recommend to recreate that sync on the UI / create a new sync with the desired entities and check if the users are imported and assigned to the proper groups.

We would like to check the results and also link or screenshot the logs from the AD Sync operation, in the same section.

Please let us know when you have availability for a remote session.

Hi,

 

Thanks for the update! I was in a workshop after the extended holiday and today is my first day back in the office. Have there been any changes of the last few days? 

 

I’m including Brad on this email trail – it looks like the server synchronization is still taking place daily, but it is not updating the membership counts from within the console. 

 

Thanks!

Sorry for the delay. I have a meeting at that time – are there any other options for tomorrow afternoon? If not, then Thursday afternoon? Mornings EST tend to be very busy, unless you can do Friday. 

 

If there are no alternatives, I can move things around for tomorrow.

Hi,

 

Thanks for the update! I was in a workshop after the extended holiday and today is my first day back in the office. Have there been any changes of the last few days? 

 

I’m including Brad on this email trail – it looks like the server synchronization is still taking place daily, but it is not updating the membership counts from within the console. 

 

Thanks!

Hi Flaviu,

Sorry for the delay. I have a meeting at that time - are there any other options for tomorrow afternoon? If not, then Thursday afternoon? Mornings EST tend to be very busy, unless you can do Friday.

If there are no alternatives, I can move things around for tomorrow.

Hi Marc-Anthony,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

We would like to do the below steps together with you in a remote session.

As a first step, we recommend to recreate that sync on the UI / create a new sync with the desired entities and check if the users are imported and assigned to the proper groups.

We would like to check the results and also link or screenshot the logs from the AD Sync operation, in the same section.

Please let us know when you have availability for a remote session.

HI Marc-Anthony,

Same here, today is my first day after a few days off. I checked with Flaviu and on the system, there is no update yet,

Hi,

Thanks for the update! I was in a workshop after the extended holiday and today is my first day back in the office. Have there been any changes of the last few days?

I'm including Brad on this email trail - it looks like the server synchronization is still taking place daily, but it is not updating the membership counts from within the console.

Thanks!

Hi Flaviu,

 

Sorry for the delay. I have a meeting at that time – are there any other options for tomorrow afternoon? If not, then Thursday afternoon? Mornings EST tend to be very busy, unless you can do Friday. 

 

If there are no alternatives, I can move things around for tomorrow.

Hi Marc-Anthony,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

We would like to do the below steps together with you in a remote session.

As a first step, we recommend to recreate that sync on the UI / create a new sync with the desired entities and check if the users are imported and assigned to the proper groups.

We would like to check the results and also link or screenshot the logs from the AD Sync operation, in the same section.

Please let us know when you have availability for a remote session.

HI Marc-Anthony,

Same here, today is my first day after a few days off. I checked with Flaviu and on the system, there is no update yet,

I followed up internally and will get back to you as soon as we have an update on this.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi,

 

Thanks for the update! I was in a workshop after the extended holiday and today is my first day back in the office. Have there been any changes of the last few days? 

 

I’m including Brad on this email trail – it looks like the server synchronization is still taking place daily, but it is not updating the membership counts from within the console. 

 

Thanks! 

 

 

 

Regards,
