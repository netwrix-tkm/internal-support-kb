There is an update on this case after I had a follow up remote session with the customer.

I had a remote session with the customer on the 18th February and I tested with the customer the EPP client to see if it still enforces the CAP policies despite EPP Notifier window now working properly.  We uninstalled EPP Client v6.2.3.1 and installed EPP client v6.2.4.2000, below are the observations made (this is also demonstrated and described verbally in the video recording up[loaded to the attachments folder.

* The EPP client does not behave the way it was designed to behave, the tab ""Content Aware Protection"" does not appear when in fact the EPP client did receive an updated policy to enforce Content Aware Protection.
* The EPP Server IP address / hostname is not visible from the EPP Client notifier window but this is configured and present in the EPP client logs.
* When manually updating the policies on the EPP endpoint then the ""Last connection to server"" time stamps are not immediately updated on the EPP Client notifier window.
* The EPP Client does successfully enforce the polices received and is working as expected in terms of enforcing CAP policies.  This includes DPI (SSL certificate is present in web browser).  Content uploads are blocked, web domains added to the Denylists are successfully blocked.
* It does seem that there is a delay from the EPP client side after manually updating the policies, whereby the new policies are not enforced immediately after updating the polices, so it may seem that the EPP client is not working at all at first but after waiting a few minutes we observed that it does enforce CAP policies.
* After Collecting the diagnostics from the EPP Server UI, we can see the EPP Client did compile and upload the artifacts ( please see the artifacts in the attachments folder.

Please see in teh attachments folder the video recording demonstrating the behaviour with the EPP logs taken from the Support tool as well as the artifacts.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-19T06:29:57.000Z","2025-02-19T06:29:57.000Z","false","false"

The EPP client is receiving the CAP policies but indeed, there is an issue with the EPP Notifier. There are probably some missing Global Sign certificates on user's machine. Or a missing Windows update. By the way, does this reproduce on multiple machines?
