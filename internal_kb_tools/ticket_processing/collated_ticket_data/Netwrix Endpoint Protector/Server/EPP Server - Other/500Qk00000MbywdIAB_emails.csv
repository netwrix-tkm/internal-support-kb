Hi Easton,

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.

Hi Easton,

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.

Hi Easton,

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.

Hi Easton,

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

The HTTP client download page is no longer supported by us since the EPP server version 5.9.4.0 and it will be removed completely in the near future. This decision was made as part of the security improvements implemented in the 5940 Server image.

At this time, there are no plans to reinstate the download page. Furthermore, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security, we are redesigning the Client upload/download mechanism in the upcoming 5950 release. Consequently, the HTTP availability will not be restored.

We assure you that clients can still be downloaded securely from the EPP Server. If desired, customers can upload these clients to their own internal HTTP portal for further distribution.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.

Hi Easton,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

The HTTP client download page is no longer supported by us since the EPP server version 5.9.4.0 and it will be removed completely in the near future. This decision was made as part of the security improvements implemented in the 5940 Server image.

At this time, there are no plans to reinstate the download page. Furthermore, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security, we are redesigning the Client upload/download mechanism in the upcoming 5950 release. Consequently, the HTTP availability will not be restored.

We assure you that clients can still be downloaded securely from the EPP Server. If desired, customers can upload these clients to their own internal HTTP portal for further distribution.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Please try rebooting the EPP server and see if it works afterwards.

You can reboot the EPP server from Appliance -> Server Maintenance -> Reboot.

Please let us know if the download works after the server is back up.
