please schedule a support meeting with fahad.aziz@psi-cro.com and jovan.salsone@psi-cro.com. 
The customer bought 2800x ADD+ (on prem) and the VM resources need to be adjusted accordingly. The customer proposed a time for the meeting so - if possible - please send an invitation for a meeting next Monday at 12AM rom time or schedule a meeting on a different time.

Thank you
Markus","","","","Root Credentials provided in remote session after signed agreement with Netwrix.
