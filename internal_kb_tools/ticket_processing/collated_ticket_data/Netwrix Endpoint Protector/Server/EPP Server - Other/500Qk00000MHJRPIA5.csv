We are facing an issue while detecting custom content. Same policy is working with other identifiers like regex and CCN, but not working for custom content. 

I have recorded a video of the issue and also collected client logs. Please refer to attached zip file. 

Kindly assist. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","Endpoint Protector did not enforces block policy from the denied custom content dictionary.  We did several tests and concluded that the custom content dictionary was the fault.  When we created an identical custom policy with the same keywords then EPP was able to block words that matched in the dictionary.","Case can be closed as issue was resolved in call.","One specific custom content dictionary was broken.  Issue was resolved after creating a new dictionary.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","5.9","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2025-02-25T11:52:42.000Z","2025-03-03T08:45:15.000Z"
