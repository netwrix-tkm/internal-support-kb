Hi Team,

We recently procured 250 additional licenses for our existing endpoint license (#115140). However, after uploading the new license file, it only reflects a total of 750 licenses, which is incorrect. The correct total should be 5,250 licenses.

As a result, several endpoints are now unlicensed, which is impacting our DLP process. Could someone please look into this and resolve the issue as soon as possible?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-23T15:32:27.000Z"
