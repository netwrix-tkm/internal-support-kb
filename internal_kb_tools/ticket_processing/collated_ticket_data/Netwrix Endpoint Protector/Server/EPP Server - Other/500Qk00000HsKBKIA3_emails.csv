Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- we increased the number of items displayed on all pages from: Device Control -> Global Settings -> Maximum no. of records returned in a report search from 200 to 5000.
- we checked again and the Computers we delete are now deleted from the computers list.
- unfortunately we do not have an automatic deletion setting for computers that are Offline and Unlicensed, but you can use the below filter to search for them:


We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hiya!

 

Unfortunately it looks like the deleted computers are back :( 



 

I deleted down to 320 and after about ten minutes, it was at 350 again

Hi Samantha,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- we increased the number of items displayed on all pages from: Device Control -> Global Settings -> Maximum no. of records returned in a report search from 200 to 5000.
- we checked again and the Computers we delete are now deleted from the computers list.
- unfortunately we do not have an automatic deletion setting for computers that are Offline and Unlicensed, but you can use the below filter to search for them:


We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

As we spoke we did the following:
- we increased the number of items displayed on all pages from: Device Control -> Global Settings -> Maximum no. of records returned in a report search from 200 to 5000.
- we checked again and the Computers we delete are now deleted from the computers list.
- unfortunately we do not have an automatic deletion setting for computers that are Offline and Unlicensed, but you can use the below filter to search for them:


We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Flaviu! 


I don't know why but purging the system of all machines seemed to have done the
trick! We're currently at 193 reporting in and the old ones haven't shown up.
Since it's been over 3 days, I think it's safe to say we're good to close this
out. Thank you so much!!!
