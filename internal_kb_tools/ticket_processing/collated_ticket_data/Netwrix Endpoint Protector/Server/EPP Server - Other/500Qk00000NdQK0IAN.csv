"500Qk00000NdQK0IAN","00440808","Support Ticket","Inquiry Regarding Syslog Formats","Hello,

I am opening this ticket regarding a question related to Syslog.

As shown in the attached image, I have observed two different types of logs coming from the EPP server.
One type is a Syslog with field names, while the other type is a Syslog without field names.

I would like to inquire about the differences between these two logs, why they appear differently, and under what circumstances each type is generated.

Thank you.","","Custoemr wants to know the syslog formats used by Epp.","Send the syslog format document.","Information provided.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","4.1","Closed - Resolved","VicCnS Co.,Ltd.","Donghyun Kim","2025-04-03T04:11:58.000Z","2025-04-07T05:49:19.000Z"
