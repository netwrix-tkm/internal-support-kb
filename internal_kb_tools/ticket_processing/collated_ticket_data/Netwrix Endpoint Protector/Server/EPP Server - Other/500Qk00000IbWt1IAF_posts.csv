I took a backup and totally 13 files where listed under the ""Log Backup Files"". Further I selected all to archive and saved them as a zip. Once, the archiving is completed it creates a random file, I downloaded and tried renaming the extension still didn't work.

Refer to the attached image.

Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-21T09:22:02.000Z"
