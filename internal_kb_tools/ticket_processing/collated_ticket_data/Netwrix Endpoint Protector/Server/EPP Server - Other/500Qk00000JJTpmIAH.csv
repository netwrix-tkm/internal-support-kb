Customer name is PrivatBank.
They tried to gather logs from macOS computer today at 10:31 GMT+2.
But since this time they cannot download this artifact (logs) with the error ""File not Found"".
What could be the reason for such a delay?
Would it be possible to search for this artifact on the EPP server backend to download it from there?","","","","fixed temporary","","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","79.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-12-10T13:59:52.000Z","2025-02-27T15:11:01.000Z"
