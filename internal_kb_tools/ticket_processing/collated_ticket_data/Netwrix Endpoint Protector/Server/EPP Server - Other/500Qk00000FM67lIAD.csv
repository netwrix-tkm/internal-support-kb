"500Qk00000FM67lIAD","00420094","Support Ticket","Server Appliance upgrading/version number not increasing","Hi, Our server appliance version shows the number5.7.0.0 and when I patch it it doesn't change. Is there anyway to upgrade it to 5.9.3 or the latest EP Appliance? I think i mentioned this to your colleague the last time i was doing patching and i was leaving it as for now. Though looking at the screenshots on the patching guides i don't see what is shown on my appliance web management site.","","","","Customer:

Hi Andre,

 

I’ve got this sorted thanks. I’ve been given the lasted appliance installer and I have migrated user base to that.

Regards
