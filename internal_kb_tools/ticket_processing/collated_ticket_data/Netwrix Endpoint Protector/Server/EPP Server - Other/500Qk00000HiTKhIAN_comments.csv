Hi,

I was able to reproduce this scenario on our side. The issue is in the Alert creation , ""Check all"" checkbox in the Administrator section.

A task was created for the fix.

As a workaround , please edit the Alerts , uncheck all Administrators and Save the Alert without any Administrators. Edit again and manually check each Administrator that needs to receive the Alert without using the ""Check all"" checkbox.

Thanks

Hi,

This is not related to the initial reported issue with the alerts.

The message from the UI test mail, shows that the email has been sent but it cannot check if the recipient has received it.

At around 16:00 the error messages are : 

   ""DSN: Service unavailable""
   ""Name server: smtp.office365.com: host name lookup failure""
   ""stat=User unknown""

You can try these steps to debug:

    1. Please double check the E-mail Server settings. Make sure TLS1.3 is checked. I noticed ""version=TLSv1/SSLv3"" in the log

    2. Check if  E-mail Server settings have been changed since it was last working. To view the changes go to:
        Reports and Analysis - Admin Actions
        filter by UI Section: Configuration

      3. Check with the customer if there have been any changes to the  account used in the E-mail settings or any changes to Firewall, Filters, Limitations on receiving emails from EPP (root@eppserver).

       4. Check  dead.letter - it may provide a more detailed error message
           vim  /var/lib/sendmail/dead.letter
           and look for messages from the day of the test

Regards,
Alina
