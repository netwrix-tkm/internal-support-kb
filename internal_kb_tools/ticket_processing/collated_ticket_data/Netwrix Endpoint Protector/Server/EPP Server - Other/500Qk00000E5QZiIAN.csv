Initial Description: 
We try to use UTC as much as possible in our detections and triages.
While checking the details in the Content Aware Report we noticed the lack of Client and Server time in UTC. As we use the SIEM we confirmed that this information is available in the server/ alerts logs. Can this be included as an option in the Admin UI?","","The customer would like to have the Client and Server time in UTC for the Content Aware Report","R&D confirmed that this feature is part of EPP Unify roadmap","Feature request was opened.","Other","Emil Podar","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","279.9","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Henrique Praxedes","2024-08-06T17:51:07.000Z","2025-05-13T15:57:21.000Z"
