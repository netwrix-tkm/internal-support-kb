As per Our Audit Requirements, we need to configure DLP polices in ""Report & Block"" Mode with Alert Notifications to end user in the event of File Transfer / Copy / Delete & Print operation. right now, DLP is configured in ""Report only Mode"" 

We need more understanding & recommendations from your side on what features are available DLP that we can utilize to comply with our audit requirements

- sent the customer a guide on how to change the CAP policy type from report only to block and report, and how to set up alerts for different file actions
- the customer asked for further details and I suggested we have a remote session to discuss them

15.04
- we scheduled a remote session for 16.04 to go over their questions

16.04
 during the RS we did the following:
- let the customer know how CAP policies work (threshold, exit points, custom dictionaries, blocking, selected users)
- changed a policy from report only to block & report to test
- client in Hidden mode, put in in Normal mode to receive notifications
- showed the customer how to create custom templates for CAP notifications
- we noticed that if print screen is blocked in a CAP policy, screen sharing in Zoom and Teams (monitored applications) will turn black - ask about this in global support meeting

17.04
- schedule a remote session to troubleshoot and test with other applications as well

22.04
- remote session scheduled on the 24th
