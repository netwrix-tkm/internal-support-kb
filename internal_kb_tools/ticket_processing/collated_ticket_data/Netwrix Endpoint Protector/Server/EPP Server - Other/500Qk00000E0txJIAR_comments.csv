1. It would be possible to add a custom subdomain for Bank Aladon, however this change involves some things on our side.


On one part, we would need to involve the business on this decision.

Should they approve we'd need to talk internally, inside DevOps, on all steps needed in order to implement.

2. To find out the public IP address of the EPP Server, a ping can be made on tu4njym.hosted.endpointprotector.com.

In this case, the IP address is 108.137.105.248

Customer returned with the following questing: 
They have found from a public DNS checker that the current EPP server has the Public IP address 108.137.105.248.
Could you please confirm whether this is a static IP specifically assigned for Bank Aladin Syariah?

This confirmation is necessary so they can whitelist this IP to integrate with their Active Directory (AD) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

Hi,


Yes, that is a static IP (AWS Elastic IP) uniquely assigned to Bank Aladin EC2 appliance.

Customer returned with the following question:

We are currently in the process of integrating the customer EPP tenant with their SIEM server. During this process, we observed incoming traffic from the IP address 198.199.98.246, which differs from the previous IP address we had on previous record( 108.137.105.248).

Could you please confirm if the IP address 198.199.98.246 is an expected outgoing IP from cloud hosted EPP? Additionally, can you confirm if this IP is solely used for communication with the Aladin system, or if it is part of a load balancer configuration?","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-10-02T14:39:48.000Z","2024-10-02T14:39:48.000Z","false","false"

No, our Hosted instance for Aladin does no go out with that IP address - 198.199.98.246. Whois says it pertains to Digital Ocean - see: https://www.whois.com/whois/198.199.98.246

At the moment, no update on that part. I will need to check with devops to see if they raised this with business or not.
