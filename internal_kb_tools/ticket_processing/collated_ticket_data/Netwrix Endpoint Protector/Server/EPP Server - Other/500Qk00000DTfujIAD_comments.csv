The query provided is a workaround to fix the 'license' column state from the Computers page.

This status is set by a flag (trialversion from clientmachine table.). If its value is NULL or lower than 1, the status for the machine will be set as ""Unlicensed"", otherwise the status will be ""Licensed"".

The query will set the flag as null for the machines that don't have a license associated.

One of the situations when the value of this flag is changed is when the Automatic Release License is set.

To investigate what went wrong, please provide us the following information:

	 - 	When the automatic license released was set to run?
	 - 	Please check how many machines are in this situation.


	 - 	SELECT COUNT(1) FROM clientmachine WHERE reregister=1 AND trialversion IS NOT NULL;
	 - 	Check the value of trialversion  and when the machine has communicated last time 

	 - 	SELECT id, name, lastseen, trialversion FROM clientmachine WHERE reregister=1 AND trialversion IS NOT NULL;

The screenshots were attached to the ticket.
As you can see in the screenshots, we have computers which checked with the server 91 days ago, and which still appear as licensed. I can confirm that they do not have a license assigned, but the fact that they appear as license will mess with the reports the customers have to export.

Please let me know which is the next step for this investigation.

Is there something we can do in a future server update which will address this?

Kindly inform the customer that implementing the provided workaround is the only solution to resolve the issue with the 'License' state column from the Computers page.


To obtain more information on why the column is not being upgraded properly, please enable the log for the cron job that manages the automatic license release.
>> touch /var/eppfiles/automatic_release_license.log

You may keep the log enabled for one day, but please avoid extending it beyond that as it may impact server performance.

After one day, kindly retrieve the file's content from the server and then delete the file.
>> rm /var/eppfiles/automatic_release_license.log

From the attached logs it seems that the computers are released.
Have you checked if the 'License' column value is displayed correctly? For the machine IDs listed in the log file (23048,21941, 22384, 22088,  22152, 33016, 26901 ).

I added some new screenshots to the ticket.
I can confirm that for the computers that you asked me to check the licenses were correctly removed and that the correct status is displayed in Device Control -> Computers.
However there are still computers which show the incorrect status.
I attached a screenshot for one of these computers. 

Usually for other customers I used the command to release the licenses from all the computers which could not be found in the license table. But Booking refuses to use this as they think that this is just a workaround and then the issue will reoccur.

Let me know if we can do something about these computers without having to run the command manually.

Nothing else can be done.
