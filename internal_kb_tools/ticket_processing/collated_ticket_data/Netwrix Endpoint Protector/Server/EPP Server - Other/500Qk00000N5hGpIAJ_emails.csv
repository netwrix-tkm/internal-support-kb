Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

The times are automatically updated and synchronized with the NTP Server selected under ""Appliance"" > ""Server Maintenance"". See below screenshot.  When daylight saving time is implemented then the NTP server should automatically provide the correct time.



I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards
