user reset the MFA apps, not unable to login to netwrix portal, kindly help to reset the password.

We connected in a remote session today and the customer informed me that they no longer have access to retrieve the MFA codes in order to successfully log in to the EPP Server's UI.  I requested ssh access but I was not able to make a SSH connection to the backend of their EPP Sever which is hosted locally on premises.  It is either due to a firewall that is blocking port 22 and SSH connections or SSH is turned off on the EPP Appliance.  I requested access to the console but the customer informed me that they need to get their IT administration team onboard in a remote session to provide Netwrix Support with the necessary and required access.","2025.05.09
We will schedule a follow up session for next week Monday or Tuesday when the customer's IT administration team will also be present or at least make the necessary configuration changes in order for us to access their EPP Server's backend via SSH.

The issue was resolved in a remote session by removing the MFA via the backend of the EPP Server Appliance.  Customer confirmed that case can be closed.","2025.05.12:
