1.	Connection Issues:
Between 40 to 60 computers are unable to connect from the client software to the EPP Server, although they appear connected from the appliance.

2.	Troubleshooting Steps Taken:
• Attempted to ping the EPP Appliance IP which failed.
• Rebooted the EPP Appliance and one of the affected client computers.
• Reinstalled the EPP Client on a client machine.
• Verified the absence of firewall restrictions on the network.
• Inspected the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf file to verify TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 configurations.
• Compared network settings between a known good client and a problematic one.
• Downloaded and installed the latest client software on an affected machine.
• Ran the EPP server change IP program.
• Created logs and customer sent to me via email
• Uploaded the logs to case.

Log Location:
https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00444806
