"500Qk00000E0kHMIAZ","00417028","Support Ticket","Installation Splunk/Tenable","Hello!
Is there a way to install Splunk Universal Forwarder / Tenable Nessus Agent on our on-premise epp-servers?
I know how to install it, but I do not have the root password/permission to do so.
Do you install it for us or can we do it by ourself?

Kind Regards,
David Patscheider
