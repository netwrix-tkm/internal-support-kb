The partner provided this update:

""The internet problem at our business partner has been fixed. Modules are active. We installed the agent and it appears online.
Our only problem for now is that the Snapshot of the server cannot be taken. Is it related to the “Agent Status Not Ready” warning? (please refer to the screenshot).
Is it because it is the Virtual Machine being deployed? Because it is not selected here. Which one should we choose?""

(Please refer to the screenshots)

Would someone from the DevOps team be able to help with the customer's questions please?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-12-03T18:26:56.000Z","2024-12-03T18:26:56.000Z","false","false"

Hi Andre,

As we do not have the Azure agent installed by default on our Azure instances, the following procedure must be used when creating snapshots: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/unmanaged-disks-incremental-snapshots
Otherwise if they want to go with the flow of installing the Azure agent this will require the NDA and waiver to be filled by the customer as the agent gives them root level access.
