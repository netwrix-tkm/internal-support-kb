Good day!
Can we check if there's any upcoming firmware updates for EPP server ?
As of now we can see the latest firmware being 5.9.4.0 

We are asking this as we have a customer that we're performing the preventive maintenance for in the upcoming few months, and we will need to get the offline updates from EPP to perform the offline upgrades for the customer.

Thank you!
