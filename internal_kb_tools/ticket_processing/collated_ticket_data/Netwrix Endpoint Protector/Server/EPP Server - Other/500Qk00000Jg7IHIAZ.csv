States that phone number not defined for admin. 
Cannot modify phone number due to error that presents itself.","","","","We removed the brackets and minus signs from the Admin phone number on the page and after that the settings were saved and you were able to receive the test email.

The settings should be okay in the backend now and also optimized for the resources currently allocated on the EPP server. If more computers or additional modules get added or activated then additional resources may be needed in order to improve the performance.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","4.8","Closed - Resolved","Alpha Mechanical Service, Inc.","Chris Rhodes","2024-12-18T22:14:11.000Z","2024-12-23T18:29:54.000Z"
