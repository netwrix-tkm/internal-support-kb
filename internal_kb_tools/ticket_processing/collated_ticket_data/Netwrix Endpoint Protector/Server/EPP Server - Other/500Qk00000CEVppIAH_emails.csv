One of my colleagues who works in your timezone will reach out to you tomorrow at their earliest.
In the meantime, for a server hosted in the cloud with 500 endpoints the minimum resources are 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, and 300GB disk space. If you want 20% of them to also have file shadowing, which we never recommend to have enabled all of the time, you will need to increase the minimum specs and as much disk space as you can assign.
As for the rest of the questions, they are out of support knowledge and my colleague will reach out to your account manager.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
