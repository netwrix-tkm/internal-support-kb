"500Qk00000GQclCIAT","00422418","Support Ticket","Managing File Shadows","Hello together,

as we experienced an unintentional increase of file shadows today, we wanted to have a look at them and delete some unwanted one. Therefore we had a look into ""File Maintenance"" under ""System Maintenance"" and then ""Shadow Files"".
But here only ""meaningless or incomprehensive"" folder names are listed(Pic1). When we click through them, we can find some files but that is not an ideal option to look or even search for specific shadow files. I am aware of the options under ""Audit Log Backup"", but that is not exactly what we are looking for.
Are we missing something here or is there another more elegant way to have a look at our shadow files and delete some specific ones if want to?

Thank you in advance!","","","","deleted the requested .nde files.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Geislinger GmbH","Panagiotis Dragatis","2024-09-30T09:42:23.000Z","2024-10-01T07:07:25.000Z"
