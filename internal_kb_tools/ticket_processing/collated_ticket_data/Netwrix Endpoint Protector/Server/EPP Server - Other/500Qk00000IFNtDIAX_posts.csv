Good day!
We have a couple of queries we need to check with EPP as it's not listed in the user guide.

1) We understand the maximum size of the logs to be kept is at 1024mb. May we know a rough estimate from EPP regarding how long it will take before the older logs get overwritten ?

2) What are the filetypes used for the SIEM integration? Are they syslog files or UTF+8 filetypes ?

Thank you!
