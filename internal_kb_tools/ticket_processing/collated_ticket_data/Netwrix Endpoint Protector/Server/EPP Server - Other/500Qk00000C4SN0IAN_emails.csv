Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

Regarding the intercept VPN traffic setting that is affected by enabling Debug Logging, I am able to reproduce this within our environment.  I will consult with our developers regarding this and get back to you with an update.

To check which users have custom settings, you will need to generate an ""Effective Rights"" report.  Based on the options you select from the Effective Rights Criteria form, you can view information based on rights, users, computers, device types, specific devices, report type (PDF or XLS), including Outside Hours and Outside Network Policies, and more.

To generate an Effective Rights report for this specific need, navigate to ""Dashboard"" > ""Effective Rights"" then select the criteria as I have in the below example screenshot.  Wait for the report status in the list below to change from ""Generating report"" to ""Ready to download"" (you may need to refresh the page after a few minutes in order to the updated status to reflect).  You can then proceed to download the report when the status shows that it is ready to be downloaded.





I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.  I will get back to you regarding the Intercept VPN Traffic that is affected by the debug logging setting.



Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the answer. It seems like this report only generates user rights. We would require user settings, as that is the section where the different options are of interest for us. Any way that we can generate a report for user settings?

Kind regards,
Denis

At the moment this can only be done on the computer level and not the user level unfortunately.

To see the settings level applied for the computers you can create a ""Settings Report"" under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" then click on ""Choose action"" > ""Settings Report"". See below screenshot.
