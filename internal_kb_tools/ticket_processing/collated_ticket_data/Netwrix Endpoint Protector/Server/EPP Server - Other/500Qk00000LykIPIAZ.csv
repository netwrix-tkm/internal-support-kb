"500Qk00000LykIPIAZ","00436059","Support Ticket","Incorrect Computer Serial Number Reported in Admin Console","The admin console is reporting incorrect serial numbers for some Windows 10 and 11 computers with multiple build numbers.   The console shows a much larger number with dashes.  Please advise.","","We have advised the customer to try to uninstall and delete one of the affected computers and let us know the outcome, and also to attach some screenshots from the EPP Console and EPP Agent.

We want to schedule a remote session with the customer to collect the client logs to identify if the Serial Number is correctly sent by the epp client or if there is a server issue with processing the serial number.

The customer reported that the issue is no longer reproducing on all of the initially mentioned computers(46), and they will monitor the situation for a few days.","Waiting for the customer's reply to our suggestions.

We are waiting for the customer to share his availability for a remote session.

We will follow-up in a few days to check if the issue still persists.","A reboot for the affected computers solved this issue.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","10.2","Closed - Resolved","Uniphore","Walt McClelland","2025-02-17T15:14:43.000Z","2025-02-27T20:25:43.000Z"
