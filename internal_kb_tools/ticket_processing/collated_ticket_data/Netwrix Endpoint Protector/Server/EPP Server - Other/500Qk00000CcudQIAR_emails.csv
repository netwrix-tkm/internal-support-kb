The latest Hot-fix is not going to import the new agents. The agents will be treated sepparately.

Here are the download links for the agents:
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip


We can schedule a remote session for tomorrow in order to inject the new EPP Clients in the EPP Server. This way you will be able to push the client update from the EPP UI.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil

Thanks for the offer, but let’s take a rain check today. We don’t deploy the client via the console anyway, we use SCCM / Jamf.

Will be back in touch if anything is needed.

Many Thanks

Andy
