Hi Flaviu,

For matter of urgency, We'd restore our DLP server from the backup restore point and for now it is up and running. I discussed with my team and For now I think no further troubleshooting is needed.

Thank you so much for your time yesterday. We'll let you know if there are any more issues.

Please feel free to close this ticket.

Thanks.

Hi Flaviu,

 

For matter of urgency, We’d restore our DLP server from the backup restore point and for now it is up and running. I discussed with my team and For now I think no further troubleshooting is needed. 

 

Thank you so much for your time yesterday. We’ll let you know if there are any more issues.

 

Please feel free to close this ticket.

 

Thanks.

Parin
