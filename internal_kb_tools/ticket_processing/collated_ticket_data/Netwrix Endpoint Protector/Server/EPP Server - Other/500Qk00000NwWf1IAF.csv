When I add keywords to the deny list and then upload files like DOCX or PDF embedded inside an image file, the system doesn't inspect those files for the keywords. So why doesn't DLP block files? Please refer to ticket ID 424813 for further details.","","Client is having issues with the OCR functionality that is partially working while using 6.2.4.2 EPP client version.

He is saying that if he attaches an image with sensitive content on Word or PDF document, it doesn't get blocked by our solution and they would like to know why.
