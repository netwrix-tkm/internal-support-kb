Hi,

Thanks for your email.

But this has happened only after applying the hotfix and its not reverting to its original ip now when we are attempting to change it.

Kindly arrange a Remote session so that I can clear it to you.

Thank you for your email.
Is it possible that you bring a network specialist- he needs to check the exact gateway address and make sure that information is correct.
Prior to this,perhaps do a server reboot before trying again.
Also, try to match the first ""Name Server"" entry with the Default Gateway.
Please check below my setup.
If issue continue- please check the document for deployment here - https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf

Hi  Adrian,

Thank you for your email.

We are not new to ip addressing and very well aware how to configure ip addresses.

Please make a note that we have tried multiple times to configure the gateway ip as our firewall ip is our LAN gateway.

Further to this I will try configuring Name Server ip same as Gateway Ip as suggested by you and update you on this.

Regards.
Khalid

Hi,

I have tried exactly the way mentioned by you but EPP server is not taking Static IP configuration.

Let me assure you the same ip address pool is there in our entire network and working perfectly fine.

Kindly schedule the Remote session on 05th July 2024 between 11.00am to 6.30pm IST and confirm.

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
Is it possible that you bring a network specialist- he needs to check the exact gateway address and make sure that information is correct.
Prior to this,perhaps do a server reboot before trying again.
Also, try to match the first ""Name Server"" entry with the Default Gateway.
Please check below my setup.
If issue continue- please check the document for deployment here - https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 33/51 Chapter 5, where id shows how to set them up.
Do let me know of the result please. If you are unable to address it, we should have a call.

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
If you have access to the EPP appliance, you can change from there the IP, from DHCP to static
so it won't keep changing the Ip every few days and proceed to fill in the required details.

Hi,

 

I have tried exactly the way mentioned by you but EPP server is not taking Static IP configuration.

 

Let me assure you the same ip address pool is there in our entire network and working perfectly fine.

 

Kindly schedule the Remote session on 05th July 2024 between 11.00am to 6.30pm IST and confirm.

Hi  Adrian,



 



Thank you for your email.



 



We are not new to ip addressing and very well aware how to configure ip addresses.



 



Please make a note that we have tried multiple times to configure the gateway ip as our firewall ip is our LAN gateway.



 



Further to this I will try configuring Name Server ip same as Gateway Ip as suggested by you and update you on this.



 



Regards.



Khalid

Hi,

 

I have tried exactly the way mentioned by you but EPP server is not taking Static IP configuration.

 

Let me assure you the same ip address pool is there in our entire network and working perfectly fine.

 

Kindly schedule the Remote session on 05th July 2024 between 11.00am to 6.30pm IST and confirm.

Hi  Adrian,



 



Thank you for your email.



 



We are not new to ip addressing and very well aware how to configure ip addresses.



 



Please make a note that we have tried multiple times to configure the gateway ip as our firewall ip is our LAN gateway.



 



Further to this I will try configuring Name Server ip same as Gateway Ip as suggested by you and update you on this.



 



Regards.



Khalid

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
Is it possible that you bring a network specialist- he needs to check the exact gateway address and make sure that information is correct.
Prior to this,perhaps do a server reboot before trying again.
Also, try to match the first ""Name Server"" entry with the Default Gateway.
Please check below my setup.
If issue continue- please check the document for deployment here - https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 33/51 Chapter 5, where id shows how to set them up.
Do let me know of the result please. If you are unable to address it, we should have a call.

Hi,

 

Thanks for your email.

 

But this has happened only after applying the hotfix and its not reverting to its original ip now when we are attempting to change it.

 

Kindly arrange a Remote session so that I can clear it to you.

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
If you have access to the EPP appliance, you can change from there the IP, from DHCP to static
so it won't keep changing the Ip every few days and proceed to fill in the required details.

Hi  Adrian,



Thank you for your email.



We are not new to ip addressing and very well aware how to configure ip addresses.



Please make a note that we have tried multiple times to configure the gateway ip as our firewall ip is our LAN gateway.



Further to this I will try configuring Name Server ip same as Gateway Ip as suggested by you and update you on this.



Regards.

Khalid

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
Is it possible that you bring a network specialist- he needs to check the exact gateway address and make sure that information is correct.
Prior to this,perhaps do a server reboot before trying again.
Also, try to match the first ""Name Server"" entry with the Default Gateway.
Please check below my setup.
If issue continue- please check the document for deployment here - https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_Virtual_and_Hardware_Appliance-User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 33/51 Chapter 5, where id shows how to set them up.
Do let me know of the result please. If you are unable to address it, we should have a call.

Hi Khalid,

Thank you for your email.
If you have access to the EPP appliance, you can change from there the IP, from DHCP to static
so it won't keep changing the Ip every few days and proceed to fill in the required details.

Hi,

 

I have tried exactly the way mentioned by you but EPP server is not taking Static IP configuration.

 

Let me assure you the same ip address pool is there in our entire network and working perfectly fine.

 

Kindly schedule the Remote session on 05th July 2024 between 11.00am to 6.30pm IST and confirm.

Hi  Adrian,



 



Thank you for your email.



 



We are not new to ip addressing and very well aware how to configure ip addresses.



 



Please make a note that we have tried multiple times to configure the gateway ip as our firewall ip is our LAN gateway.



 



Further to this I will try configuring Name Server ip same as Gateway Ip as suggested by you and update you on this.
