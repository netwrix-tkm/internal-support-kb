"500Qk00000HiTKhIAN","00425670","Support Ticket","We are not being notified of alerts by email","For some reason we are again having issues with alerts being sent to email.","","- mailer folder got deleted, re-created it and test email went through
- waiting until monday for the customer to check if alerts are coming in and his email address doesn't show up multiple times in the recipient list
- the customer is still experiencing the alerts issue, rescheduled the remote session several times because of their availability

- remote session finally happened on the 23rd of January
- re-created the alerts cache, but alerting still didn't work

- in the latest remote session, 13.02, we sent a few test emails in the remote session and noticed there are connection refused error messages in the logs(syslog and mail.log), the customer sent them over and I uploaded them to the R&D case
- telnet to smtp was successful

-we asked the customer for a new remote session to perform the next steps suggested by R&D","waiting on R&D

We are waiting for the customer's availability.","The mailer folder got deleted, and re-created it and test email went through,  re-created the alerts cach, telnet to smtp was successful.
The customer confirms the issue is no longer reproducible and this ticket can be closed.","","Iosif Muntean","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","133.1","Closed - Resolved","Healthcare Fraud Shield","Karl Strobach","2024-10-31T14:32:23.000Z","2025-03-13T16:01:18.000Z"
