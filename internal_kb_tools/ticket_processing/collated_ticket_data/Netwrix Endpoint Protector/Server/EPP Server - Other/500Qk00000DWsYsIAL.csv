"500Qk00000DWsYsIAL","00416049","Support Ticket","Server configurations questions after first installation","Dear Support,

partner F.T.P. Srl asked to me for some checks after they first installation. Below doubts that I need your help to answer:
1)Partner tried to download from here <a href='https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-emailthe' target='_blank'>https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-emailthe</a> the latest appliance 5.8.1.0 VHDX but told that is not starting properly. He needed to download the previous on an apply all the updates. May you check if the template is damaged or working properly?
2)Is it possible to change the SSL certificate to access to server web console? 
3)When setting the certificate for communication between clients and server, what happen when it expires?
4)We have created manually a System Administrator with the same name of a domain account. Then we deleted it and set up the sync to import administrators from an AD group anyway the previous mentioned account has not created into administrators list also considering that it belongs to selected group. Is it a well known bug? How to import this account from AD anyway?
5)When syncing AD for users and computers into Directory Services > Microsoft Active Directory, partner cannot browse groups and sub-OU. Is it normal? I can do it in my lab.
