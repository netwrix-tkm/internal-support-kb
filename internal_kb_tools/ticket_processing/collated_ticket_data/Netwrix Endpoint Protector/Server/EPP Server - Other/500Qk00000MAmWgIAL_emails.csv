Hi, 

 

Thank you for your support on this issue. I can access the EPP dashboard on the computer it is installed. However, it is inaccessible on other computers on the same network. 

 

Also, the current EPP version is 5.9.3.0 Should I update it to 5.9.4.0 since it is available? 

 

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

 

Best regards,

 

Gurpal Nagra, IT Engineer/Web Developer

If this happens again, you can try turning off the Epp server and then trying to ping the IP  again.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MAmWg:ref

 


Hi, 

 

Thank you for your support on this issue. I can access the EPP dashboard on the computer it is installed. However, it is inaccessible on other computers on the same network. 

 

Also, the current EPP version is 5.9.3.0 Should I update it to 5.9.4.0 since it is available? 

 

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

 

Best regards,

 

Gurpal Nagra, IT Engineer/Web Developer

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
If this happens again, you can try turning off the Epp server and then
trying to ping the IP  again.
This way you can see if a different server is trying to run on the same IP.

Kind regards

Hello,

Do those computers see any error when trying to reach the UI?
Can you ping the Epp server from that computer?

Yes, you can update the server to 5.9.4.1.
Before updating please create VM snapshot to have a safe point in case of an
issue.
