Hi Eduard,

 

If there’s an option to export the report from the backend, I’d like to explore it. Otherwise, I’m okay to wait.

 

Thanks

Hey Arpitha,

I just found out that the upgrade is postponed until Friday. If the report is not urgent, we can also postpone this issue until then.
Let me know if that is okay with you.

Hey Arpitha,

I asked our server team why they would not show up on the list, so the next step is to set up a remote session later today so we can see firsthand what is happening.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session later in the day?

Hey Arpita,

When checking in System Maintenance -> Exported Entities after you exported a settings report you need to go to the Settings exports tab to find it.


When exporting the list of computers in the same menu you have to check the List of exports tab.


Please let me know if you found your export.

Thank you,

Engineering just answered and said that there is no option to export from the backend and they are suggesting upgrading to 5.9.4.0, which we both know it's in the making.
I guess there is no option but to wait until the server is upgraded.
Let's check back after the upgrade is done.

Hey Arpita,

When checking in System Maintenance -> Exported Entities after you exported a settings report you need to go to the Settings exports tab to find it.


When exporting the list of computers in the same menu you have to check the List of exports tab.


Please let me know if you found your export.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

Engineering just answered and said that there is no option to export from the backend and they are suggesting upgrading to 5.9.4.0<http://5.9.4.0>, which we both know it's in the making.
I guess there is no option but to wait until the server is upgraded.
Let's check back after the upgrade is done.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

I will open an internal question for this and see if they can provide a way for it, and in case for some reason on Friday, the report is still not available, at least we already have the ticket open. Do you need the Settings report or the List of Computers?
If I receive a way to export from the backend I will get back to you, otherwise, we can see on Friday.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

Engineering just answered and said that there is no option to export from the backend and they are suggesting upgrading to  5.9.4.0, which we both know it's in the making.
I guess there is no option but to wait until the server is upgraded.
Let's check back after the upgrade is done.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

I will open an internal question for this and see if they can provide a way for it, and in case for some reason on Friday, the report is still not available, at least we already have the ticket open. Do you need the Settings report or the List of Computers?
If I receive a way to export from the backend I will get back to you, otherwise, we can see on Friday.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

I just found out that the upgrade is postponed until Friday. If the report is not urgent, we can also postpone this issue until then.
Let me know if that is okay with you.

Hey Arpitha,

I asked our server team why they would not show up on the list, so the next step is to set up a remote session later today so we can see firsthand what is happening.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session later in the day?

Thank you,

Hey Arpita,

When checking in System Maintenance -> Exported Entities after you exported a settings report you need to go to the Settings exports tab to find it.


When exporting the list of computers in the same menu you have to check the List of exports tab.


Please let me know if you found your export.

Thank you,

Sounds good. We can wait until next week and check back, I know there were some issues and we can wait them out before testing just to make sure the server is in working condition.

Hi Eduard,

 

I tried but couldn’t generate it. Recently, we had a disk space issue. I’ll try again today and confirm back..

 

Thanks

Did you get the chance to see if you can export now after the upgrade took place?

Hey Arpitha,

Engineering just answered and said that there is no option to export from the backend and they are suggesting upgrading to  5.9.4.0, which we both know it's in the making.
I guess there is no option but to wait until the server is upgraded.
Let's check back after the upgrade is done.

Thank you,

Hey Arpitha,

I will open an internal question for this and see if they can provide a way for it, and in case for some reason on Friday, the report is still not available, at least we already have the ticket open. Do you need the Settings report or the List of Computers?
If I receive a way to export from the backend I will get back to you, otherwise, we can see on Friday.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

 

If there’s an option to export the report from the backend, I’d like to explore it. Otherwise, I’m okay to wait.

 

Thanks

Hey Arpitha,

I just found out that the upgrade is postponed until Friday. If the report is not urgent, we can also postpone this issue until then.
Let me know if that is okay with you.

Hey Arpitha,

I asked our server team why they would not show up on the list, so the next step is to set up a remote session later today so we can see firsthand what is happening.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session later in the day?

Thank you,

I have done the same exercise in the past but this time I am not able to see the reports here.

Hey Arpita,

When checking in System Maintenance -> Exported Entities after you exported a settings report you need to go to the Settings exports tab to find it.


When exporting the list of computers in the same menu you have to check the List of exports tab.


Please let me know if you found your export.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
