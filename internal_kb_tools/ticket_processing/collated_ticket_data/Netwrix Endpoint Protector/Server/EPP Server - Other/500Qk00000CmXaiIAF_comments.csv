The customers tried to update their SSL Certificate, they did not succeed and they rebooted the server. After the reboot they had to set the EPP Server's IP again. After this reboot the computers were not able to communicate with the server anymore.","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2024-07-10T07:16:52.000Z","2024-07-10T07:16:52.000Z","false","false"

For some reason even if they had an nginx config file which had a different port for UI and a different port for client-server communication, a new ""listen"" code line a new line appeared with the server IP and the port 443. 
The customer asked if we can give them the root cause for this issue. They asked why the epp.nginx.conf file could modify if they tried to import the ssl certificate and to reboot the EPP Server. (Worth to mention that after the server was rebooted they had to set the server's IP again).
Could the server reboot modify the nginx config? If so, they would like to know why.

Changes to certificates usually require updates to the Nginx configuration file.

If the customer is using a custom port, these updates should be handled by the support team so as not to overwrite the custom Nginx config file.

@Emil-Ionut Podar, please do the following:

1. Check if the config file is not corrupted: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml (In the backend procedure you can find how this file should look;)

2. Check if Increased Communication Security is enabled, and disable it. (Appliance -> Server Maintenance page, Increased Communication Security section.)
After the UI setting was disabled, please also check the epp.nginx.config and make sure the wsf entry looks like this:

vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf

--- CODE ---
 
    location ~ ^/wsf/(.+.php)$ {

        #if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        #       return 401;
        #}

        alias   /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/$1;
        include fastcgi_epp_params;
    }
--- CODE ---

If the comunication isn't established:

3. Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack.

If comunication is established, and the customer uses a UI certificate, please advise him to upload the UI certificate again.
