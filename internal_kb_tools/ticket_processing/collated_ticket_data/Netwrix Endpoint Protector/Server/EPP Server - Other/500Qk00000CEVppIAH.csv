"500Qk00000CEVppIAH","00412833","Support Ticket","[Bank Aladin]EPP Server Sizing Recommendation and Support Information for Customer Deployment","Hi Support,
We need assistance with sizing an EPP server for a customer deployment. 
The customer has the following endpoints:
300 Windows endpoints
200 macOS endpoints

Additional Details:
- 20-30% of endpoints will have fileshadowing enabled.
-  The server will be deployed on the customer's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure.

Requirements:
- Recommended server specifications (CPU, RAM, storage) for the specified endpoints.
- Support option. We understand that Netwrix provides 24/5 support as stated on the Netwrix customer support program but do we have 24/7 support option?If yes, is there any SKU or required purchase from customer?
- What is required from the customer to set up a High Availability (HA) environment? Or this size still not eligible for HA deployment?

Thank you.

Regards,
