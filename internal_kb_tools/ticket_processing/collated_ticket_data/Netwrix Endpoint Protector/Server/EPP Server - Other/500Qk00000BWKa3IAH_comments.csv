From customer today:


	 - 	Ensure port 25 is running for localhost and FQDN of China instance # netstat -ntlp | grep sendmail

	 - 	Port 25 should listen on both i.e. localhost and cim5d26.hosted.endpointprotector.com
	 - 	Ports 25/587 should be open
	 - 	Run check-hostname script and ensure the hostname consistence and okay along domain name

	 - 	/etc/mail/hosts
	 - 	/etc/hosts
	 - 	/etc/nsswitch.conf  <Ensure dns lookup start from host file>
	 - 	/etc/mail/access < Connectivity check> for localhost, localhost.localdomain, server FQDN i.e. cim5d26.hosted.endpointprotector.com
	 - 	Root users are not allowed by default in sendmail. Check LOCAL_USER value and allow root account.

	 - 	Hostname and site name is okay in sendmail.mc.
	 - 	SMART_HOST is point to our email security

They are requesting a meeting with a developer ""with sendmail experience""

Hi @Andrew Siemasko,

I hope you are well.

After discussing with dev team, I can confirm the following: We do not officially support SMTP relay, only a direct connection to a SMTP server with UI settings and limitations.
If we need to support SMTP relay, please either create a new investigation request or add to this request all the information related to their infrastructure. After that, we will ask DevOps team to do a sendmail POC and if needed, server team will add anything else that is required in the codebase.

Thank you and apologies for the delay on this one.

Regards,
Cristi

Hi Support,

We don't officially support SMTP relay. If behavior of this MTA indicate different response than target mail servers, we are not supporting it.
If other instance of EPP works with that SMTP Relay, seems MTA behave properly, but there is routing issue on customer side then. 
Our DEV team will no provide outside EPP product any customer environment SMTP/routing troubleshooting. Out of EPP scope. This is task of customer mailing/routing teams or their providers.  Based on earlier Oana feedback SMTP on our appliance works if proper message is return and seems traffic is cut off somewhere on customer side.

@WaitingOnEngineer 

Any Exchange and related DKIM/SPF/DMARC configuration is Haelon part, it should be configured and investigated by customer related support team responsible for Exchange and DNS domain configuration, as well any network routing traffic.
Our DEV can only support appliance part, to ensure that services are running and attempting to deliver e-mails based on given configuration. DEV will not provide any support for 3rd party solution or technology.

@WaitingOnEngineer @Stacy Petruzzi 

In this case nothing changed. 
As it was confirmed by our DEV's configuration and ""relay"" part is proper. 
Any other troubleshooting or 3rd party communication is on customer support side. 
Based on Andrew comment: https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/345975#10587653 I believe it is routing/config issue on customer side.

As well as was bellow mentioned (https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/345975#10583036) we only support direct SMTP connection, so if used MTA is not responding like SMTP server, we don't support it.
