Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we removed the Custom Client Certificate set on the UI, changed the port to 443 on the client and after that both EPP clients connected to the EPP server.

We have also uploaded the SSL certificate on the EPP server and after that it was secure.

We are closing this ticket.
