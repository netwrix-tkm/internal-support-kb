Hello Samantha,

Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. 

Netwrix is aware of the out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported version of PHP. 

We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur within 4 months.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you and have a great weekend.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

As per our remote session, I will raise the question to my team as to the status of the PHP upgrade process and will get back to you regarding the next steps on this. Once we find out the answer, we recommend that you open a new case towards migrating your current EPP server to a newer version. 

I will keep you posted as to what I find out from my team.

Thank you for your time.

Here's what migrating to Ubuntu 22, hosted by you on AWS, will entail:

1. Migration Request: You request to migrate to Ubuntu 22.
2. Image Sharing: I will open an internal ticket to have my team share the Ubuntu 22 image with your AWS ID and region. When I receive a response on this, we will get back to you with a documentation on how to set up the new instance. 
3. Configuration Setup: Once you receive the image, copy all settings, policies, and user data to configure the new EPP server or we can schedule a remote session to migrate the server together.
4. Network Configuration: Update the network settings to point to the new EPP server. We have 2 options here: 1. either swap the IP's in AWS(old EPP server and new EPP server) or 2. change the IP of all EPP clients to point to the new EPP server. This is needed in order for the EPP clients to communicate with the new EPP server.
5. Device Integration: Allow computers and devices to connect to the new EPP server.
6. Client Software Updates: Push client software updates to the connected computers and devices.

During the migration, computers will retain their existing policies.

Please let us know if you want to migrate and which option you wish to pursue:

Options:

1. The computers, users, policies, settings, but WITHOUT the logs.
2. Everything including the logs.

If you decide to proceed with the migration, please provide me with:

1. The AWS ID .
2. The AWS region where the server is hosted.
3. What type of migration(with or without logs) you would like us to perform
4. The version of the current EPP server(can be found in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI).

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

Here's what migrating to Ubuntu 22, hosted by you on AWS, will entail:

1. Migration Request: You request to migrate to Ubuntu 22.
2. Image Sharing: I will open an internal ticket to have my team share the Ubuntu 22 image with your AWS ID and region. When I receive a response on this, we will get back to you with a documentation on how to set up the new instance. 
3. Configuration Setup: Once you receive the image, copy all settings, policies, and user data to configure the new EPP server or we can schedule a remote session to migrate the server together.
4. Network Configuration: Update the network settings to point to the new EPP server. We have 2 options here: 1. either swap the IP's in AWS(old EPP server and new EPP server) or 2. change the IP of all EPP clients to point to the new EPP server. This is needed in order for the EPP clients to communicate with the new EPP server.
5. Device Integration: Allow computers and devices to connect to the new EPP server.
6. Client Software Updates: Push client software updates to the connected computers and devices.

During the migration, computers will retain their existing policies.

Please let us know if you want to migrate and which option you wish to pursue:

Options:

1. The computers, users, policies, settings, but WITHOUT the logs.
2. Everything including the logs.

If you decide to proceed with the migration, please provide me with:

1. The AWS ID .
2. The AWS region where the server is hosted.
3. What type of migration(with or without logs) you would like us to perform
4. The version of the current EPP server(can be found in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI).

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. 

Netwrix is aware of the out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported version of PHP. 

We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur within 4 months.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you and have a great weekend.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

As per our remote session, I will raise the question to my team as to the status of the PHP upgrade process and will get back to you regarding the next steps on this. Once we find out the answer, we recommend that you open a new case towards migrating your current EPP server to a newer version. 

I will keep you posted as to what I find out from my team.

Thank you for your time.

5. Device Integration: Allow computers and devices to connect to the new EPP server.
6. Client Software Updates: Push client software updates to the connected computers and devices.

During the migration, computers will retain their existing policies.

Please let us know if you want to migrate and which option you wish to pursue:

Options:

1. The computers, users, policies, settings, but WITHOUT the logs.
2. Everything including the logs.

If you decide to proceed with the migration, please provide me with:

1. The AWS ID .
2. The AWS region where the server is hosted.
3. What type of migration(with or without logs) you would like us to perform
4. The version of the current EPP server(can be found in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI).

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. 

Netwrix is aware of the out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported version of PHP. 

We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur within 4 months.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you and have a great weekend.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

As per our remote session, I will raise the question to my team as to the status of the PHP upgrade process and will get back to you regarding the next steps on this. Once we find out the answer, we recommend that you open a new case towards migrating your current EPP server to a newer version. 

I will keep you posted as to what I find out from my team.

Thank you for your time.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

Here's what migrating to Ubuntu 22, hosted by you on AWS, will entail:

1. Migration Request: You request to migrate to Ubuntu 22.
2. Image Sharing: I will open an internal ticket to have my team share the Ubuntu 22 image with your AWS ID and region. When I receive a response on this, we will get back to you with a documentation on how to set up the new instance. 
3. Configuration Setup: Once you receive the image, copy all settings, policies, and user data to configure the new EPP server or we can schedule a remote session to migrate the server together.
4. Network Configuration: Update the network settings to point to the new EPP server. We have 2 options here: 1. either swap the IP's in AWS(old EPP server and new EPP server) or 2. change the IP of all EPP clients to point to the new EPP server. This is needed in order for the EPP clients to communicate with the new EPP server.
5. Device Integration: Allow computers and devices to connect to the new EPP server.
6. Client Software Updates: Push client software updates to the connected computers and devices.

During the migration, computers will retain their existing policies.

Please let us know if you want to migrate and which option you wish to pursue:

Options:

1. The computers, users, policies, settings, but WITHOUT the logs.
2. Everything including the logs.

If you decide to proceed with the migration, please provide me with:

1. The AWS ID .
2. The AWS region where the server is hosted.
3. What type of migration(with or without logs) you would like us to perform
4. The version of the current EPP server(can be found in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI).

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

Netwrix has obtained extended life support for Ubuntu 18, and thus these instances receive security updates. If preferred, Netwrix can migrate your instance to one running Ubuntu 22. 

Netwrix is aware of the out-of-date PHP version and the Endpoint Protector development team is actively working on a project to update, in phases, to a supported version of PHP. 

We anticipate the first phase of these updates to occur within 4 months.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you and have a great weekend.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Samantha,

As per our remote session, I will raise the question to my team as to the status of the PHP upgrade process and will get back to you regarding the next steps on this. Once we find out the answer, we recommend that you open a new case towards migrating your current EPP server to a newer version. 

I will keep you posted as to what I find out from my team.

Thank you for your time.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
