I am following up in regards of your inquiry related to port 443.

To respond to it, it is possible  perform this change but for that we require SSH access.

I have scheduled a remote session for Monday, March 31st at 12 PM Turkey time.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

Hello Yunus,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440018. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440018
Ticket Subject: Question
Ticket Details: Hi,

The console port and client ports communicate on port 443.

Is there any chance for me to separate them? For example, I want to use 443 when accessing the console, but I want to use a different port when the clients communicate with the server.

Can you tell me how to do it?

Best regards

Thank you!

Thank you for following up on this. Due to our current commitments, our schedule is quite full at the moment. However, we have reserved a slot for a remote session with you next Tuesday at 11:00 AM Turkey time.

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom

Hello Yunus,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440018. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440018
Ticket Subject: Question
Ticket Details: Hi,

The console port and client ports communicate on port 443.

Is there any chance for me to separate them? For example, I want to use 443 when accessing the console, but I want to use a different port when the clients communicate with the server.

Can you tell me how to do it?

Best regards

Thank you!

Marian Ilies

Thank you for allowing to assist you today with changing the needed port.

During the remote session, we went on and switched the port to 8443 and then tested successfully.

As you saw during the tests, the connectivity to the console was successful and you could login to the server.

Since the request has been completed, we will proceed further and close the case.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.
