I have tried manually deleting them from Device Control > Computers, but they just re-appear.

Additionally, I've noticed what appears to be a bug -- at one point I saw that we had 300+ computers in the server, but the CSV export from Device Control > List of Computers - with ""show all entries"" marked - the CSV only exports 200 devices.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-04T20:37:13.000Z"
