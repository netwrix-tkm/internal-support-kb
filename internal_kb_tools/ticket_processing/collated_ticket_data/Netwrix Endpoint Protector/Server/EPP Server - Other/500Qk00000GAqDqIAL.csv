2. When enabled the DPI feature, customer not able to assign the technician on their helpdesk tool.
3. AWS account not able to use. getting network failure error.
4. Customer wants to send the emails to only listed domains or or email should be block listed denied domains.( For Web and Outlook email accessing users )
