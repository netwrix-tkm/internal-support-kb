"500Qk00000Cp9C1IAJ","00414420","Support Ticket","Licenses have expired on Server","Hi,

We have the EPP Appliance in use and also bought Licenses extension for the Clients in April (CI-1138) but our Server shows:
""Licenses have expired. Renew subscription to continue taking advantage of Endpoint Protector.""
License End Date: 19 Apr 2024 00:00:00

Did we miss something?

I would guess that we have to Import some Licence files but i cant find any...
Could you send them again? or could you tell me who recived them?

kind regards
