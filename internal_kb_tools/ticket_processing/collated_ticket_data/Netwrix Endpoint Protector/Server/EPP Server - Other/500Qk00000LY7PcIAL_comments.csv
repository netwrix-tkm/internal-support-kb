Hello,
What ""failed tests"" exactly means?
Is there any error displayed on the UI or in the request response after using the delete action? If not then is possible that an error message will be displayed if you access again Device Control -> Computers after using the delete action.
Does the UI get stuck after using the delete action?

How many computers does the customer wants to delete?

We need the output of the following query from db to see what process is used when deleting with checked select all entries option:

--- CODE ---
select value from parameter where name = 'limit_select_all_action';
--- CODE ---

Hello,

This could be a permission issue. Please check if the entities_to_be_deleted directory has the right owner and permission:

	 - 	

--- CODE ---ls -ld /var/eppfiles/entities_to_be_deleted--- CODE ---


The permission for entities_to_be_deleted directory should be 755 and www-data set as owner. If they do not have these permissions, please set them.

	 - 	

--- CODE ---chmod 755 /var/eppfiles/entities_to_be_deleted--- CODE ---

	 - 	

--- CODE ---chown www-data:www-data /var/eppfiles/entities_to_be_deleted--- CODE ---


Also please increase the value for limit_select_all_action parameter to 1000 which is the default value. Run the following query into the database:

--- CODE ---

--- CODE ---UPDATE parameter SET value = 1000 WHERE name = 'limit_select_all_action';--- CODE ---

--- CODE ---
