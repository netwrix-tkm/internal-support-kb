Hi John,

I appreciate your call back and apologize on my phone issues.  The issue was regarding an email my supervisor received (below).  We have Netwrix Auditor 10.5.10977 and we have CoSoSys Endpoint Protector which is weird because I didn't know Netwrix owns this Endpoint Protector.  The agents for Endpoint Protector are 5.8.4.1 and the server is version 5.7.1.0.  We don't own the server on-prem.  I wanted to know if we need to upgrade from our end with either Netwrix Auditor or Endpoint Protector.
