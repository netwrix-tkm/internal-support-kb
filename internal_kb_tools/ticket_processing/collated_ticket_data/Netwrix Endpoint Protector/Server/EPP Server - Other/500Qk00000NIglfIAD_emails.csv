Thank you for following up on this.

To respond to your inquiry, you do not need to upgrade the EPP version for this, but we strongly recommend to upgrade the server version if possible to at least 5.9.0.0, ideally to 5.9.4.1 to benefit of the latest updates.

Also, if you wish to upgrade the server version, make sure first you take a snapshot of the EPP virtual appliance in your virtualization environment and also make sure you have a back up v2 in place so in case anything happens you can rely on them to restore the instance.

Looking forward to your response.
