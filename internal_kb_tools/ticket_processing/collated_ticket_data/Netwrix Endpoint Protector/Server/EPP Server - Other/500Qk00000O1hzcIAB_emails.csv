Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Dear Botond Biro,

 

Thanks for your support , Here I need further details on Blocking Polices

 


	How will it work & based on what criteria ? 
	will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
	Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
	Email file Transfers
	Blocking Exceptions
	Thresholds
	Custom dictionary
	Alerting to Admin & Notifications to end user for sensitive data handling


 

We need to implement these policies with minimal impact on end users , so we need your recommendations on how we configure effective DLP Polices ,

 

We can also have meeting call to discuss further.

Arsalan Khan

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Dear Botond Biro,

 

Thanks for your support , Here I need further details on Blocking Polices

 


	How will it work & based on what criteria ? 
	will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
	Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
	Email file Transfers
	Blocking Exceptions
	Thresholds
	Custom dictionary
	Alerting to Admin & Notifications to end user for sensitive data handling


 

We need to implement these policies with minimal impact on end users , so we need your recommendations on how we configure effective DLP Polices ,

 

We can also have meeting call to discuss further.

Arsalan Khan

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Dear Botond Biro,

 

Thanks for your support , Here I need further details on Blocking Polices

 


	How will it work & based on what criteria ? 
	will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
	Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
	Email file Transfers
	Blocking Exceptions
	Thresholds
	Custom dictionary
	Alerting to Admin & Notifications to end user for sensitive data handling


 

We need to implement these policies with minimal impact on end users , so we need your recommendations on how we configure effective DLP Polices ,

 

We can also have meeting call to discuss further.

 



 

 

Regards,

Arsalan Khan

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

I believe it would be best to schedule a meeting to discuss these details.
Please let me know what you're timezone is and your availability for tomorrow so I can check my calendar.

  1.  How will it work & based on what criteria ?
  2.  will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
  3.  Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
  4.  Email file Transfers

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:
[cid:image002.png@01DBB37A.2E6CB5E0]
After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:[cid:image003.png@01DBB37A.2E6CB5E0]


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Dear Botond Biro,

Thanks for your support , Here I need further details on Blocking Polices


  1.  How will it work & based on what criteria ?
  2.  will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
  3.  Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
  4.  Email file Transfers
  5.  Blocking Exceptions
  6.  Thresholds
  7.  Custom dictionary
  8.  Alerting to Admin & Notifications to end user for sensitive data handling


We need to implement these policies with minimal impact on end users , so we need your recommendations on how we configure effective DLP Polices ,

We can also have meeting call to discuss further.

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:
[cid:image002.png@01DBB37A.BEFDAEC0]
After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:[cid:image003.png@01DBB37A.BEFDAEC0]


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Hi Arsalan,

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Dear Botond Biro,

 

Thanks for your support , Here I need further details on Blocking Polices

 


	How will it work & based on what criteria ? 
	will it block access to users file transfer , file print , file delete etc. operations
	Also need more details on Content Aware Policies how it works ?
	Email file Transfers
	Blocking Exceptions
	Thresholds
	Custom dictionary
	Alerting to Admin & Notifications to end user for sensitive data handling


 

We need to implement these policies with minimal impact on end users , so we need your recommendations on how we configure effective DLP Polices ,

 

We can also have meeting call to discuss further.

 



 

 

Regards,

Arsalan Khan

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:
[cid:image002.png@01DBB523.FE162AB0]
After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:[cid:image003.png@01DBB523.FE162AB0]


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.

Hi Arsalan,

I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I would like to troubleshoot the screen sharing issue further, could we schedule a remote session starting Tuesday next week?
I can't earlier, since Friday and Monday are public holidays.

Thank you for your time today!

Please continue testing and figuring out what needs to be blocked, and in the meantime I asked why screen sharing goes black if print screen is enabled.

Hi Arsalan,

Thanks for reaching out!

Report & Block mode can be set up for Content Aware Protection policies. If you already have policies in Report Only mode, you can edit them:

After selecting Block & Report from Policy Action, scroll down to the bottom and save the policy.


For File Copy/Transfer, Delete and Print, you can set up alerts from Alerts -> Device Control Alerts -> Create (you will have to create separate alerts for each type), select the groups/users/computers and save:


If you want to, or need to, you can also create alerts for Content Aware policies.
