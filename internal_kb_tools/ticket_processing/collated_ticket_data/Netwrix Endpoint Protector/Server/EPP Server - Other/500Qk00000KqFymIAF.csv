"500Qk00000KqFymIAF","00432860","Support Ticket","Do we support Flipper Zero and raspberry pi devices in DC?","Hi team,

We are working on a tender document and one of the questions is: Blocking and identifying hacking devices (Flipper Zero, raspberry pi)

Can we block these devices?

Thank you
Stefania","","","Checking with Robert Z.","Unless these devices are detected by the EPP agent the answer is no. A device detected by the EPP agent will appear in the list of devices shown in the EPP Notifier application.

On Windows we might detect some of these devices as ""Teensee Board Device"", ""Keyboard Device"", ""USB Modem"" etc. If we don't, and they want to detect these devices they can request this using a ticket and provide logs and registry exports for us.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","8.1","Closed - Resolved","Airpak","Stefania Oltean","2025-01-20T13:51:53.000Z","2025-01-28T16:25:02.000Z"
