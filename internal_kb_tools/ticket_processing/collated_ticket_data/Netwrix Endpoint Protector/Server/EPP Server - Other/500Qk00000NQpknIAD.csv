Currently, we have to manually upload the certificate into the Cososys console every three months and then handle the certificate renewal process.

Our CTO has expressed dissatisfaction with this setup and suggested seeking a refund. This has become a release blocker for us. Kindly take the necessary steps to address this issue at the earliest.","","let the customer know automatic SSL renewal is not possible","waiting on the customer","let the customer know automatic SSL renewal is not possible","","Botond Biro","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","DRAFTSPOTTING TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED","Rajesh Kumar","2025-03-28T09:28:36.000Z","2025-04-04T10:56:41.000Z"
