"500Qk00000Fx8KJIAZ","00421452","Support Ticket","SMTP issues","We are configuring an external SMTP server on our CoSoSys hosted instance (<a href='https://35ylwgp.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>https://35ylwgp.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>) but out test messages are not received. Are there firewall rules that need to be opened from the hosted environment or are there updated configuration guidance that can be shared with us?

Our smtp server is: <a href='https://mx0a-00158602.pphosted.com' target='_blank'>mx0a-00158602.pphosted.com</a> (67.231.149.12)

Thank you in advance,
