Hi Flavi,


As a workaround please try to do the following and if the issue persists, please provide the logs and screenshots for all the below points:

	 - 	uninstall the agent from that machine
	 - 	delete the duplicated machine from the UI
	 - 	check if any custom certificate is used (DPI certificate or Client registration certificate or is enabled the Comunication security  )
	 - 	enable the Registration logs from the server

	 - 	 vim /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php

	 - 	set DEBUG to  true
	 - 	set 'DEBUG_VERBOSITY to  1017
	 - 	save the file
	 - 	reinstall the agent;
	 - 	update the policy
	 - 	check if the machine is duplicated again
	 - 	provide the logs from /EPPServer/sieratool/log/WebServiceFree.log
	 - 	disabled the debug mode from  /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php


Regards,
Augustina
