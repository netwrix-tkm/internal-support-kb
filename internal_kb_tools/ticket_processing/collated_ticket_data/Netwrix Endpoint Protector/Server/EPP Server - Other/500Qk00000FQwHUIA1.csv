"500Qk00000FQwHUIA1","00420321","Support Ticket","Backend Security Updates does not work for several EPP server Upgrade versions","Since about 5.9.0.0 after every EPP server upgrade, when we tried to apply the Backend Security Upgrade it did not work and support had to clear space in the backend of the EPP server.","Waiting on R&D.","Since about 5810 or 5900 EPP server version, every time the customer tries to apply the backend security updates this fails. This happened at least 3-4 times and I hat to apply the boot disk at 100% clear procedure.
Previous to 5810 or 5900 our manager had periodic calls with the customer to apply the backend security updates.

What happens:
1. Customer upgrades the EPP server.
2. Checked for backend security updates(ALL).
3. A list is returned.
4. The customer tries to apply them
5. After waiting a period of time and searching again the same backend security updates appear.
Looplike behavior, and they do not apply.

We checked in the backend and it seems that the boot partition is close or at 100% full.","10Feb: Currently customer has moved their instance on hosted by us, but they seem to have issues with EPP client connectivity. Waiting on case from Zach to see resolution. This ticket may be closed if migration to hosted by us is successful.

Waiting on R&D.","Informed customer that at the moment we unfortunately do not have an automated script for this. It is still being worked on. My colleagues recommended, in case the issue persists after migrating to hosted by us, to clear the space as we did till now, until the script is implemented.
Customer confirmed we can close.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","193.8","Closed - Resolved","Chapman and Cutler LLP","Veronica Yessa","2024-09-06T18:02:47.000Z","2025-03-19T13:16:17.000Z"
