"500Qk00000FDzg9IAD","00419752","Support Ticket","Endpoint Protector Server - External Storage Settings","Hi Team,
We have External Storage Server: ZS-FTP01 configured in EPP Console. Need to know for SaaS EPP Server if the ZS storage server is being used or not.
Our Internal Storage team is not seeing any logs flowing to it. Please confirm.
If not needed, we can get it decommissioned. Attaching Screenshot of System Maintenance - External Storage page.
Thanks
Manpreet Singh","","","","The customer agreed that we can close this ticket after we discussed about the External storage feature and how to use it.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","5930","8.1","Closed - Resolved","ZS","Manpreet Singh","2024-09-02T10:35:50.000Z","2024-09-10T11:51:09.000Z"
