Hi Andrew,

The request has reached our security team and they will let us know if that is something they approve.
Let's wait for next week and see if they respond, either way, I will bring this up in the next escalation meeting we have.

We are unable to use another port with proofpoint. Please escalate this ticket as email alerts from the hosted appliance is required functionality.

Hi Andrew,

I still have no replies from our security team. In the meantime, did you manage to check if another port can be used? Or an SSL or TLS configuration can be used?

Hey Andrew,

Port 25 will not be of any use since it is blocked by AWS, which is where we host your appliance.
TLS should work just fine if the configuration is correct.
When setting it up, please use a hostname instead of the IP in the configuration, and if the test email is not sent you can also try using TLS1.3 if the SMTP server is using it.
If you want us to test the configuration in a remote session, please let me know your timezone and availability and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,



 



We are using smtp server on our hosted Proofpoint instance.



 



The server we are planning to use is 67.231.149.12



We would prefer to use TLS but have both 25 and 587 open for testing at this time.



 



It doesn't appear that there is any outbound connectivity from the hosted endpoint protector instance to our SMTP Server.



 



Thank you,



Andrew

Hey Andrew,

Can you share a screenshot of the SMTP configuration on our server?
Is the SMTP server a local server you host or is it hosted on O365 or AWS?

The security team has no issue requesting the outbound rule for your SMTP server on port 25.
DevOps will open a request with AWS and let you know once it is done. Since this depends on how fast AWS replies, I cannot provide a time frame for it.
