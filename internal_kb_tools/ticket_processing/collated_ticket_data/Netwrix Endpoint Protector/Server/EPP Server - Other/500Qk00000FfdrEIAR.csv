"500Qk00000FfdrEIAR","00420824","Support Ticket","EPP licensing issue due to client duplication","Hello,

Customer name is PrivatBank.
They are lack of the licenses right now and reported about next behavior:
If they update Linux client from version 2.4.2.1 to 2.4.3.1 with no free license, there appear two duplicates of this EPP client in the console (Device control).
But the new Client is showing up like unlicensed and with no any information regarding it, so it is ""empty"" (you may see it in the screenshot).
So, the license still attaches to the previous version of this client, and if you release the license from this computer, the new client will catch it and only then will start communicating with the EPP server.
I will attach two screenshots, where first before the license was released from the client and the second is when the license was released and attached to the updated EPP client.","","","","Since the customer received additional licenses, this issue is not recreating currently.
So, I guess we can temporarily close this ticket until the issue comes back.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","26.8","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-12T13:18:32.000Z","2024-10-09T08:15:56.000Z"
