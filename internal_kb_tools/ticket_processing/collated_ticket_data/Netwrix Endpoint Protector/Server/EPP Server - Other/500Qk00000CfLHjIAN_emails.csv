Hello Rob, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

I will transfer this case to my colleague Adrian, due to the fact I will be free starting with tomorrow.
He is asking if you are available for a short remote session on Monday at 11:00 AM UK time ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Rob, 

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Any third party application that you want to install on the EPP server, must be done by you according with the disclaimer signed when you received the credentials. 

Have you applied the offline patch after you install the new machine  ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
