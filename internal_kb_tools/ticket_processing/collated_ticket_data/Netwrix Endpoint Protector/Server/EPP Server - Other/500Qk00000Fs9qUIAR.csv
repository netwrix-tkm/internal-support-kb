"500Qk00000Fs9qUIAR","00421251","Support Ticket","Issue with SIEM integration | EPP server does not send logs","Hello,

We tried to configure integration with Wazuh SIEM and faced with an issue that EPP server does not send logs.
We also tried to send some EPP events through Telnet to another PC, but we did not receive any logs from EPP.
So, it seems like our EPP server just cannot send logs to other machines.
Could you please connect and help us to identify where the issue is?
We will be available for the remote session on Friday or next week.","","","","After EPP server re-installation issue disapears, integration seems to work well.
Thank you for your assistance.
Please close this ticket.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","13.9","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-17T13:15:56.000Z","2024-10-01T10:04:16.000Z"
