Hi @Botond-Robert Biro ,
to help you, we will need more information regarding what happens on the server. 

	 - 	Are only the CAP logs not entered into the system? What about DC logs?
	 - 	Did the customer apply the vulnerability patch?

	 - 	What other changes were made over the server? Have it configured using a System Backup?
	 - 	How do the cap logs tables look:
	 - 	show create table cf_log;

	 - 	show create table cf_log_details;

	 - 	Has the customer received any notification regarding the space on the server? Please check it.

I checked with the customer, and answered the questions. I created a Word document so I can add the screenshots as well, and I uploaded it to my OneDrive:

Please do the following checks:

	 - 	check the iNodes from the server 
	 - 	check if the logs are blocked in quicklogs  

	 - 	Nr. of files blocked 

	 - 	find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/logs/ -type f | wc -l  

	 - 	NOTE: if there are logs that are not processed please check again if the customer tries to apply any vulnerability patch. 
 	 - 	find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/1/ -type f | wc -l 
	 - 	find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/2/ -type f | wc -l 

	 - 	NOTE: If the workers' logs weren't processed, please get in touch with your colleagues' team so they can help you. In the last weeks, they faced two similar cases. 
    
FYI @WaitingOnEngineer
