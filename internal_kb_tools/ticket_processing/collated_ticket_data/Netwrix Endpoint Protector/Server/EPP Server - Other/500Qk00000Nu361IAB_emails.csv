Thank you for reaching out!!

I have checked on our end and if the deployment is made through JAMF, you can add the certificate while configuring the profile. 

More details can be found in our KB article:https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm

Please check it and let us know if we can assist you with anything else.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi,

Sorry for the late return.

They stated that there was no Jamf application on the customer side, WorkSpace One (Vmware) was used to manage MacOS.

I am sending the response from the customer below:

With this MDM, we need something like; “dlp_ajanı.dmg” -epp_change_ip.sh.sh will be loaded in the Agent, “epp_change_ip.sh” will contain our server IPs etc. and configuration that will load the Agent’s certificate. This can also be a command like “dlp_ajanı.dmg” - epp_change_ip.sh -trust_certificate.

I am saying this because, Netwrix was also loaded on another MacOs device that I checked, OK, but the Client certificate was not in the system. The certificate did not come to the system after the policy was written. However, the Cosasys certificate that appears on a web page can be added to the system manually and the Agent can start intervening.

Ticket Details: Hi,

Customer is Turknet

Our client is deploying agents with MDM for Macbook computers. In this way, certificates are not automatically added as trusted certificates in the agent installation. Therefore, there is a problem in site access. How can we ensure that the certificate is added automatically when deploying the agent with MDM? Macbook version MacOS 15 and above.

Best regards.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Nu361:ref

 


Hi,

 

Sorry for the late return.

 

They stated that there was no Jamf application on the customer side, WorkSpace One (Vmware) was used to manage MacOS.

 

I am sending the response from the customer below:

 

With this MDM, we need something like; “dlp_ajan?.dmg” -epp_change_ip.sh.sh will be loaded in the Agent, “epp_change_ip.sh” will contain our server IPs etc. and configuration that will load the Agent’s certificate. This can also be a command like “dlp_ajan?.dmg” - epp_change_ip.sh -trust_certificate.

 

I am saying this because, Netwrix was also loaded on another MacOs device that I checked, OK, but the Client certificate was not in the system. The certificate did not come to the system after the policy was written. However, the Cosasys certificate that appears on a web page can be added to the system manually and the Agent can start intervening.

 

Best regards

Ticket Number: 00441571
Ticket Subject: Question
Ticket Details: Hi,

Customer is Turknet

Our client is deploying agents with MDM for Macbook computers. In this way, certificates are not automatically added as trusted certificates in the agent installation. Therefore, there is a problem in site access. How can we ensure that the certificate is added automatically when deploying the agent with MDM? Macbook version MacOS 15 and above.

Best regards.

Thank you!

Hi,

https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/web-and-network-security/cloud-swg/help/conn-about-wssa/install-agent-macos/conn-wssa-uem.html

Our customer used the link above to deploy the Symantec product by entering and using the parameters. He states that Netwrix should forward the information about this and refuses to call Omnissa.

If DPI Certificate is turned on and then manually deployed to the download client pc, will this problem disappear?
What is the difference between this being off or on? Is a uniq certificate generated for each client or does it need to be on? What happens if we publish the same certificate to each client?

Should the following setting be selected automatically to avoid problems when the certificate expires?

[cid:image001.png@01DBB5F9.A8F89870]

In the screenshot below, what is the reason why the certificate information comes as N/A for some users? We added it manually on Macbook but it did not come here as trusted.

Thank you for getting back to us. 

First off all, apologise if I confused you with the link that I found regarding the Workspace One, I was trying to help with the contact. If the customer used the app from Symantec is okay, they need to discuss with them regarding the deployment issue. 

If DPI Certificate is turned on and then manually deployed to the download client pc, will this problem disappear?
What is the difference between this being off or on? Is a uniq certificate generated for each client or does it need to be on? What happens if we publish the same certificate to each client?
The DPI Certificate for Windows OS comes when the EPP client is installed, for macOS and Linux this needs to be downloaded from the EPP UI. 
To be able to download it, that option needs to be enabled. If the customer enable it and sends the certificate to all the machines, he can disable the option. 
The downloaded  DPI Certificate can be uploaded on all the macOS and Linux machines. 

Should the following setting be selected automatically to avoid problems when the certificate expires?
Sure.

In the screenshot below, what is the reason why the certificate information comes as N/A for some users? We added it manually on Macbook but it did not come here as trusted.
The N/A comes by default before the DPI module is activated or if the DPI certificate is not uploaded. 

If the endpoint will be erased from the list, the N/A will also appear and another option when the N/A is present is when the DPI is enabled and the customer disable it for testing purposes.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,

 

https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/web-and-network-security/cloud-swg/help/conn-about-wssa/install-agent-macos/conn-wssa-uem.html

 

Our customer used the link above to deploy the Symantec product by entering and using the parameters. He states that Netwrix should forward the information about this and refuses to call Omnissa.

 

If DPI Certificate is turned on and then manually deployed to the download client pc, will this problem disappear?

What is the difference between this being off or on? Is a uniq certificate generated for each client or does it need to be on? What happens if we publish the same certificate to each client?

 

Should the following setting be selected automatically to avoid problems when the certificate expires?

Hi,

 

We shared this document with the customer, but they said they do not use JAMF.

 

How can I contact the Workspace One team?

 

Best regards

Hello Yunus,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have provided you an example of how to deploy MacOS clients  through JAMF, that you can use when you are deploying through your MDM solution . 

Here is the kb article that can be used https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm
This is the most used MDM solution by our clients that why we created this kb.

If the issue is still present please check with the WorkSpace One (Vmware)   team to assist you with the deploy.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi,

 

Sorry for the late return.

 

They stated that there was no Jamf application on the customer side, WorkSpace One (Vmware) was used to manage MacOS.

 

I am sending the response from the customer below:

 

With this MDM, we need something like; “dlp_ajan?.dmg” -epp_change_ip.sh.sh will be loaded in the Agent, “epp_change_ip.sh” will contain our server IPs etc. and configuration that will load the Agent’s certificate. This can also be a command like “dlp_ajan?.dmg” - epp_change_ip.sh -trust_certificate.

 

I am saying this because, Netwrix was also loaded on another MacOs device that I checked, OK, but the Client certificate was not in the system. The certificate did not come to the system after the policy was written. However, the Cosasys certificate that appears on a web page can be added to the system manually and the Agent can start intervening.

 

Best regards

Ticket Number: 00441571
Ticket Subject: Question
Ticket Details: Hi,

Customer is Turknet

Our client is deploying agents with MDM for Macbook computers. In this way, certificates are not automatically added as trusted certificates in the agent installation. Therefore, there is a problem in site access. How can we ensure that the certificate is added automatically when deploying the agent with MDM? Macbook version MacOS 15 and above.

Best regards.

Thank you!
