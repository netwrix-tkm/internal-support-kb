Customer can connect to SMB external storage on one EPP server using username, credentials, mount point, folder, while unable to connect to same SMB external storage on another EPP server that is using same username, password , mount point and folder

Customer manually entered in username and password and mount point and copy paste with connection refused check credentials message reported

Customer IT verified that path to SMB share open

From EPP server backend, unable to telnet to external storage, attached screenshot under attachments

Verified that samba and CIFS installed on backend server

Customer unable to connect after repeated attempts

Sent customer follow up questions relating to which SMB version they are using and if the ACL is correctly configured since same username/password and mount point works on one network and not other","","","","005Qk000002lX5pIAE","2025-02-11T20:22:41.000Z"
