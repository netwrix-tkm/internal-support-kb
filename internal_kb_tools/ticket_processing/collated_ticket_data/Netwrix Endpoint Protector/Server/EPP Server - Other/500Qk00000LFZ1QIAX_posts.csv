I am looking via Licensing Status and can see we have 1356 Online:
 

But when I go to either, View Licences or Device Control > Computers, I can only see 200, even when I have selected to see All. There are not multiple pages to search through.

There are no filters that I am aware of that is limiting this further, are you aware of any issue in 5.9.4.0 or a fix for this?","","","","0050g000005zo5JAAQ","2025-01-30T06:21:55.000Z"
