I am trying to setup the AD authentication and it doesnt simply accept the password and throws me a error invalid (despite me resetting the password multiple times) and I know for the fact i am using the right password. we even tested it internally and it works fine but just on console it fails. I am available today until 2pm pst to connect and walk you through the issue if you like. 

Reg,
