We upgraded the Staging EPP server from 5810 to 5941. We also migrated with System Backup V2 the Prod server to the new Staging server.

Regarding the Certificates, you will need a body and a .key certificate to upload in Appliance -> Server Maintenance.","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-02-25T22:02:49.000Z"
