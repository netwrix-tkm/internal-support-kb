Additionally, I've noticed what appears to be a bug -- at one point I saw that we had 300+ computers in the server, but the CSV export from Device Control > List of Computers - with ""show all entries"" marked - the CSV only exports 200 devices.","","","","Deleted all computers. Offline and unlicensed computers did not come back.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","14.1","Closed - Resolved","PROOF","Samantha Skinner","2024-11-04T20:37:13.000Z","2024-11-18T22:34:09.000Z"
