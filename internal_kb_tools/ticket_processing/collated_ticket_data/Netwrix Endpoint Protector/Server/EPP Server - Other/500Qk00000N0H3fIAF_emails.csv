Can you please provide us with the name of the customer?

Regarding the error message:
I have tested again the OVF images downloaded from our page (https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email) and was able to successfully deploy the images.   We haven't received any other complains from our customers regarding the images being corrupt.  The error which you are getting seems to be isolated to the customer's environment, for this we would advise you to consult with the customer's IT administration team.

I will recommend that you retry to import the OVF image from the primary drive C instead of drive D to see if it will work, if it does work this way then you can move the virtual appliance to drive D again afterward.


Kind regards

Hi Thanushree,

Can you please provide us with the name of the customer?

Regarding the error message:
I have tested again the OVF images downloaded from our page (https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email) <https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL2VwcC92aXJ0dWFsLWFwcC1lbWFpbA==&p=m&i=NjM1YTE4ZTlkMGZjMzAxMjg0NThlMjMz&t=TVpPZlVwNXZoWGF6QzJUVWUzaGcxWkVubjJsalBJMmsrWVVncXVTVGo4dz0=&h=8c9ca09ba27b452bbf0f931958692c00&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g)>  �and was able to successfully deploy the images. We haven't received any other complains from our customers regarding the images being corrupt. The error which you are getting seems to be isolated to the customer's environment, for this we would advise you to consult with the customer's IT administration team.

I will recommend that you retry to import the OVF image from the primary drive C instead of drive D to see if it will work, if it does work this way then you can move the virtual appliance to drive D again afterward.


Kind regards

Hi Thanushree,

Can you please provide us with the name of the customer?

Regarding the error message:
I have tested again the OVF images downloaded from our page (https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email)<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5kcG9pbnRwcm90ZWN0b3IuY29tL2VwcC92aXJ0dWFsLWFwcC1lbWFpbA==&p=m&i=NjM1YTE4ZTlkMGZjMzAxMjg0NThlMjMz&t=TVpPZlVwNXZoWGF6QzJUVWUzaGcxWkVubjJsalBJMmsrWVVncXVTVGo4dz0=&h=8c9ca09ba27b452bbf0f931958692c00&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g)> and was able to successfully deploy the images. We haven't received any other complains from our customers regarding the images being corrupt. The error which you are getting seems to be isolated to the customer's environment, for this we would advise you to consult with the customer's IT administration team.

I will recommend that you retry to import the OVF image from the primary drive C instead of drive D to see if it will work, if it does work this way then you can move the virtual appliance to drive D again afterward.


Kind regards

Thank you for your time on our call earlier, the issue we discovered is that the customer used an old version of VMwarePlayer, after installing version 17 they were able to successfully deploy the Endpoint Protector virtual appliance.  Kindly confirm if we can close this ticket.

Hi Thanu,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier, the issue we discovered is that the customer used an old version of VMwarePlayer, after installing version 17 they were able to successfully deploy the Endpoint Protector virtual appliance.  Kindly confirm if we can close this ticket.
