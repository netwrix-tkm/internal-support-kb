Our 2 x on-prem servers need their admin portal certificates renewing - expire 23/3/25.

We have new certificates issued by our external CA, how do we apply the certs, do you guys have to SSH into the boxes to renew the certs?

Regards
Peter","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-04T15:39:55.000Z"
