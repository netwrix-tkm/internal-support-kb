Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

We have received the below update from our colleagues:

The latest Endpoint Protector AWS Image was shared with AWS AccountId 145712691292 in the us-west-2.

Please follow the instructions in the deployment manual for AWS in order to start the EPP Appliance: https://www.endpointprotector.com/resources#product-documentation

After you have installed the image on your end, please let us know so we can schedule a remote session to migrate.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

After this step is complete, please let us know to schedule the remote session for the data transfer.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

I am trying but it has just been sitting at this screen with the loading wheel spinning since 2:50 pm CST (it's now 3:05) is there anything I can do to speed it up or push the update in a different way?

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

I am sorry about the late reply, I was on PTO on Friday.
Could you please check if the port 80 is allowed in the firewall? This is needed to communicate with the EPP Live Update Server.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

After this step is complete, please let us know to schedule the remote session for the data transfer.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

After this step is complete, please let us know to schedule the remote session for the data transfer.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

As discussed, the only thing remained is to swap the EPP Servers IP addresses, in order for the client software to communicate with the AWS server.

We will let this ticket open for few days and will follow-up on next week.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Thank you for the remote session!
As discussed, the only thing remained is to swap the EPP Servers IP addresses, in order for the client software to communicate with the AWS server.

We will let this ticket open for few days and will follow-up on next week.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Thank you for the remote session!
As discussed, the only thing remained is to swap the EPP Servers IP addresses, in order for the client software to communicate with the AWS server.

We will let this ticket open for few days and will follow-up on next week.

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.

Hi Kristen,

Thank you for the remote session!
As discussed, the only thing remained is to swap the EPP Servers IP addresses, in order for the client software to communicate with the AWS server.

We will let this ticket open for few days and will follow-up on next week.

Hi Kristen,

I am sorry about the late reply, I was on PTO on Friday.
Could you please check if the port 80 is allowed in the firewall? This is needed to communicate with the EPP Live Update Server.

Hi Kristen,

Before scheduling a remote session, please make sure that both EPP servers are running on the same version. The one that my colleagues have shared is the latest version, so you should update the Azure one if it is running on an older version.

After this step is complete, please let us know to schedule the remote session for the data transfer.

Hi Kristen,

Please let us know your current server version, and if the AWS server will be on the same network as the Azure one, and if you want the current logs to be moved to the new server.

The steps for the migration are the following:

1. You need to send us the Account ID for AWS + the Region
2. We will create a request for our DevOps to share the AWS image with you
3. You have to install the VM using the received image
4. We will perform a System Backup V2
5. Checking that both servers are the same regarding settings, computers, licenses, policies, etc.
6. You have to update the epp clients with the new IP

Note: While the clients are still communicating with the Azure server, the logs will be sent there, so some logs will be missing until the communication with AWS is finished. As an alternative, you can shut down the Azure server until all clients have the new server IP address set.
