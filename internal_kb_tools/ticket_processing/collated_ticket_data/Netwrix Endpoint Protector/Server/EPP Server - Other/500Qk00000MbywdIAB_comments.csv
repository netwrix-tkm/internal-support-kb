Hi,

Question: Why does this customer want to use HTTP instead of HTTPS?





Did you check the Nginx file? 


--- CODE ---
vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf
--- CODE ---

Please share with us the following information, if possible:




1. It listens on port 443?

2. Is SSL enabled (ssl on)?

3. Is has an SSL certificate (ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key)?





If the answer to all of these questions is ""yes"" then HTTP (http://) will NOT work, and users will only be able to access the site via HTTPS (https://).





If not share with us the information that you have in the Nginx file.

I dont think that is correct. I have tested this on my side and a colleagues side and with the exact same settings(port 443, ssl=on and the 2 ssl cert files) present we can both access the client download page(http). To my knowledge these settings are the default ones. I will attach a screenshot with the settings on my end and the page working. 

Also I made screenshots of the entire epp.nginx.conf file and added them to the attachment folder.

Customer also mentioned the below:
""
We recently upgraded our EPP server to 5.9.4.1 and the http non-encrypted version of the management page used to have a download link for downloading the client from the server, but it's no longer working.

I spoke to one of my colleagues and he said that he checked it immediately after the upgrade and it was working, but that does not seem to be the case anymore.
""

From what the customer said the issue happened after the upgrade.

Please advise.

Provide the requested information from the customer's side as well.


Did you check the Nginx file?



--- CODE ---
vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf
--- CODE ---

Share with us the following information, if possible:

1. It listens on port 443?

2. Is SSL enabled (ssl on)?

3. Is has an SSL certificate (ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key)?

Did you check also the epp.http.nginx.conf? Do you have the epp.http.nginx.conf file at the location of /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/?

--- CODE ---
ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
--- CODE ---

If not, what types of files are available there?
If yes check the file content and the port:

--- CODE ---
vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.http.nginx.conf
--- CODE ---

Does it listen on port 80? Share the file content.

Did you check if the Nginx configuration is running and if the client has any errors?

--- CODE ---
nginx -t
service nginx restart
--- CODE ---

Hi Flaviu,

We were advised by devops that the http download page is not a functionality that we support anymore (it is not supported since at least 5.9.4.0).

Could you please confirm what is the use case for these? Why does the customer need that?

Thank you,
Cristi

The customer use case: they download the EPP clients on machines from the http client download page. They have done this for a long time.

This functionality worked till they upgraded to 5.9.4.1. Also I tested on my end and a colleagues end on 5.9.4.1 and it worked on our ends. Screenshots attached in New Remote Session folder: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00437881

I saw in the backend of the customer that there was a file missing compared to a test server: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.http.nginx.conf

Please advise.

Related to the "" Also I tested on my end and a colleagues end on 5.9.4.1 and it worked on our ends. ""

The download page is functioning correctly on our end with HTTP because we are using older images. However, I have tested it and noticed that on some servers, the download page works with HTTP, while on others, the page is unavailable. The only explanation for this is that your server has an older image, whereas the customer is using a newer one.

I also spoke with the product manager, and the removal feature has been confirmed.

""Regarding the EPP Client download page, the removal was intentional. This decision was made as part of the security improvements implemented in the 5940 Server image.
At this time, there are no plans to reinstate the download page. Furthermore, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security, we are redesigning the Client upload/download mechanism in the upcoming 5950 release. Consequently, the HTTP availability will not be restored.
We assure you that clients can still be downloaded securely from the EPP Server. If desired, customers can upload these clients to their own internal HTTP portal for further distribution.""
