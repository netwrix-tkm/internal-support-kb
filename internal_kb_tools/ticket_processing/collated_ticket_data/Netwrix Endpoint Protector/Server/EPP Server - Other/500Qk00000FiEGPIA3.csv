"500Qk00000FiEGPIA3","00420926","Support Ticket","[Request for remote support] Please kindly fix the IP issue related to #00410151.","Hi Support Team,



Thank you for your continued attention and diligence in addressing the IP issue related to #00410151. Your ongoing support is greatly appreciated.

Our customer, CJ Cheiljedang (South Koreaâ€™s No. 1 leading integrated food manufacturer), has requested remote support to resolve the IP issue related to #00410151. 

They primarily utilize Enforced Encryption, making it challenging to rebuild new images that have Enforced Encryption issues. In order to proceed with version updates, this IP issue must first be resolved.

Their EPP sever ID is '030382' and the appliance ID is '7746294724'.

Next week is Chuseok, a Korean big holiday, and they would be on vacation for the entire week.

Therefore, could you kindly provide remote support between Tuesday, September 24, and Friday, September 27, at 4:00 PM Korea Standard Time (10:00 AM Romania Time)?

Please feel free to reach out at any time if you require any additional information.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.



Best Regards,
Jack Jung","","","","The CISO of the customer, CJ CheilJedang, has decided not to receive remote support. Therefore, there is no need to provide remote support this time.

Instead, the customer has agreed not to raise any further concerns regarding the EasyLock issue, where login is possible without a password.

Please kindly close this case.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","19.1","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Korea","Support Netwrix","2024-09-13T05:01:22.000Z","2024-10-02T06:19:58.000Z"
