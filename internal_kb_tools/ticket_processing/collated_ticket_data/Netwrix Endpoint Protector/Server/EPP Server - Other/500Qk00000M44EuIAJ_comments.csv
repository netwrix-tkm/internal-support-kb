We were connected today and found out they had a config problem on the unify server. It seems that /var/eppfiles/mysql-files was missing on their server and this was the cause of the export problem. We created the folder and added the proper right, added config in mysql so that mysql could write in that file. This issue was present before 720, but I think the export were not tested before, in 710. The issue should  no longer be pressent now.
