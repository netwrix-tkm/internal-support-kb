"500Qk00000HqjwzIAB","00425886","Support Ticket","Exposed URL severity check","We got an external mail that one of our public URL is exposing some sensitive encryption keys and configuration data.
I need to understand the criticality and severity of this and where it is hosted.

Note: Before proceeding with any fixes or activity for the given URL, let's have a discussion first. I will be scheduling a call with you for better clarification of this, in the meantime please go through the details.

URL: <a href='https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt' target='_blank'>https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt</a>

Below is the procedure and impact that is shared by an external person ( bug bounty hunter ).
Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to <a href='https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt' target='_blank'>https://dlp.gameskraft.com/easylock/generatedData/metadata.txt</a>
Observe the displayed data which includes encryption keys (ivMp, saltMp, mpPub, encMpPrivByMp), unique identifiers (elId), and various configuration settings (pingInterval, passwordRules).
Expected Result: Sensitive data, especially related to encryption and system configurations, should not be accessible via a public URL. Access should be restricted to authorized personnel through secured means.

Actual Result: Encryption keys and configuration data are openly accessible through a public URL without any form of authentication or access control.

Impact: This exposure can lead to potential security breaches, unauthorized data access, and could be exploited by malicious entities to compromise the systemâ€™s security, decrypt sensitive data, or conduct targeted attacks.","","","","Answers provided to customer's questions.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","NONE","","20.8","Closed - Resolved","Gameskraft","Vikash Singh","2024-11-04T11:50:43.000Z","2024-11-25T06:33:33.000Z"
