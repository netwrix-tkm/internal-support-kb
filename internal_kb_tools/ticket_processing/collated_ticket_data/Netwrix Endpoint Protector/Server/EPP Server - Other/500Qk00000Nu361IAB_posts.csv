Customer is Turknet

Our client is deploying agents with MDM for Macbook computers. In this way, certificates are not automatically added as trusted certificates in the agent installation. Therefore, there is a problem in site access. How can we ensure that the certificate is added automatically when deploying the agent with MDM? Macbook version MacOS 15 and above.

Best regards.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-10T11:42:38.000Z"
