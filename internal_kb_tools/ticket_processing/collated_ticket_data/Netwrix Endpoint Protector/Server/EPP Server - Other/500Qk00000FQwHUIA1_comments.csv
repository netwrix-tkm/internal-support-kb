The customer's /boot partition is at 100% capacity.

Based on that the command dpkg --configure -a returns an error.
Firstly, you should follow step 3 to uninstall all kernel packages.

--- CODE ---
apt-get remove --purge `dpkg -l | grep linux | egrep -e 'linux-generic|linux-headers|linux-hwe|linux-image|linux-modules' | grep -v $(uname -r) | awk '{print $2}'`
--- CODE ---

After you have available space on the /boot partition you can run

--- CODE ---
dpkg --configure -a
--- CODE ---
without errors and follow the next steps from the procedure.

The issue is not how to fix this. The issue is that it happens every time when the customer upgrades the EPP server and then wants to apply the Backend Security Upgrades.

We applied the full procedure each time and it worked once. On the next server upgrade when they wanted to also do the backend security upgrade the issue came back.

The customer asked for a solution to not have to do these steps every time they want to apply the backend security upgrades.

Please advise.

Hi @WaitingOnDevOps,

Can someone from the Devops team take a look and see if we can automate something in this case?
We only have the manual procedure.

Hi @Oana-Cristina Rus, @Mihai Rosca @Krzysztof Staszalek
An approach would be to use multiple categories (linux-modules-, linux-modules-extra, linux-image-, linux-headers-, linux-hwe-headers-) and grep kernel-related installed packages based on each, constructing a merged list of packages in a file, say /tmp/pkg_to_remove.

dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-modules- | grep -v linux-modules-extra > /tmp/pkg_to_remove

dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-modules-extra- >> /tmp/pkg_to_remove
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-image- | grep -v linux-image-generic >> /tmp/pkg_to_remove
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-headers- | grep -v linux-headers-generic >> /tmp/pkg_to_remove
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-hwe-  | grep -headers >> /tmp/pkg_to_remove


Then gather also the names for the packages pertaining (or related) to currently running kernel with the intent of excluding them from the future removal, and write the results to /tmp/pkg_to_keep:




--- CODE ---dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-modules-`uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1,2` | grep -v linux-modules-extra > /tmp/pkg_to_keep

dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-modules-extra-`uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1,2` >> /tmp/pkg_to_keep
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-image-`uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1,2` | grep -v linux-image-generic >> /tmp/pkg_to_keep
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-headers-`uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1,2` >> /tmp/pkg_to_keep
dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | grep linux-hwe- | grep -headers | grep `uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1,2` >> /tmp/pkg_to_keep
--- CODE ---

Then compare the first list of packages ( /tmp/pkg_to_remove ) with the last ( /tmp/pkg_to_keep ) and remove only those packages which are found in the first but not also in the second list:



--- CODE ---
apt-get -y remove --purge `grep -Fxv -f /tmp/pkg_to_keep /tmp/pkg_to_remove`
--- CODE ---


Cleanup:



--- CODE ---rm -rf /tmp/{pkg_to_keep,pkg_to_remove}
--- CODE ---

In this manner we may avoid a potential filling up of space on /boot if three kernel versions are present at the same time on the machine.

Hi,

You need to follow the current procedure. No automated script is yet available, until this script is implemented please follow the procedure with boot partition.
