We connected in a remote session today and the customer informed me that they no longer have access to retrieve the MFA codes in order to successfully log in to the EPP Server's UI.  I requested ssh access but I was not able to make a SSH connection to the backend of their EPP Sever which is hosted locally on premises.  It is either due to a firewall that is blocking port 22 and SSH connections or SSH is turned off on the EPP Appliance.  I requested access to the console but the customer informed me that they need to get their IT administration team onboard in a remote session to provide Netwrix Support with the necessary and required access.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-05-09T17:37:54.000Z"

2025.05.12:
The issue was resolved in a remote session by removing the MFA via the backend of the EPP Server Appliance.  Customer confirmed that case can be closed.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-05-12T09:40:06.000Z"
