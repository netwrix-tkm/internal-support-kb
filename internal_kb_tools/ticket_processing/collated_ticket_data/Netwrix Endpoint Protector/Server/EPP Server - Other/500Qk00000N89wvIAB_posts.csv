It seems that there is no relevant setting in Default System Settings. How can this be adjusted?

To prevent MS Office PST files from being taken out, we selected OUTLOOK under CAP Policy > File Type > Office Files. However, users receive frequent alerts every time they run Outlook. Besides setting Client Mode to Silent, do you have any other recommendations?

Under Denylists > Applications, we can specify the application name, and Parameters allow additional configurations. Theoretically, using parameters, we should be able to block file transfers in WhatsApp while still allowing conversations. Is this correct?

If (3) is correct, do you have parameters to prevent file transfers in Teams, LINE, WeChat, and WhatsApp?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-20T05:29:02.000Z"
