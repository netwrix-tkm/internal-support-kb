Hi  Netwrix,

Hello Mohammad,

I trust you are well and Happy New Year to you.

Our R&D team was able to reproduce this issue by installing the Browsec browser extension. The fix that worked for us was to add the port 1022 under the ""Deep Packet Inspection Ports & Settings"" > ""Custom Ports"" like in the below screenshot.  Please note that the ""Traffic Type"" dropdown was set to ""HTTPS"".


[Image_2025-01-16_18-54-21.png]

Please let us know if this worked for you.

Hi Mohammad,

Thank you for the screenshot. What about the policy type? is ""Outside Network"" selected as the policy type?

For the Deep Packet Inspection, can you please enabled Stealthy DPI Driver, save the policies on the endpoint and try again?

Hello Mohammad,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

Can you confirm if the affected endpoints are part of a Content Aware Protection policy please? if yes, can you check to see what the policy type is please? See below screenshot.
Please check to see if ""Outside Network"" is selected as the policy type.


[Image_2024-12-18_13-41-15.png]


It would also be good to see what the current Deep Packet Inspection configuration settings are for the affected endpoints.  Can you send us a screenshot of the DPI configuration settings please (example below).  ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ComputerName > ""Manage Settings"" > ""DPI Configuration"".

Hi Mohammad,

Thank you for the screenshot. What about the policy type? is ""Outside Network"" selected as the policy type?

For the Deep Packet Inspection, can you please enabled Stealthy DPI Driver, save the policies on the endpoint and try again?

Hello Mohammad,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

Can you confirm if the affected endpoints are part of a Content Aware Protection policy please? if yes, can you check to see what the policy type is please? See below screenshot.
Please check to see if ""Outside Network"" is selected as the policy type.

It would also be good to see what the current Deep Packet Inspection configuration settings are for the affected endpoints.  Can you send us a screenshot of the DPI configuration settings please (example below).  ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ComputerName > ""Manage Settings"" > ""DPI Configuration"".
