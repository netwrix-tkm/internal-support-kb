Dear Support,

 

Unfortunately it didn’t work out. Same issue.

 

Just for you to note I had upgraded the software a couple of months ago without any issue.

 

Should we do another meeting or provide you with logs?

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you pleas let us know what EPP server / client version are you using? 

From denylist you can add the sniping tool application to be blocked, then assign it to a policy that will be applied to users.

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Support,

Unfortunately it didn't work out. Same issue.

Just for you to note I had upgraded the software a couple of months ago without any issue.

Should we do another meeting or provide you with logs?

Dear Support,

 

Unfortunately it didn’t work out. Same issue.

 

Just for you to note I had upgraded the software a couple of months ago without any issue.

 

Should we do another meeting or provide you with logs?

On the CAP policy, under the policy exit points, you should have the Print screen option, that need to be enabled.


Please check and let us know if the situation persist .

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you pleas let us know what EPP server / client version are you using? 

From denylist you can add the sniping tool application to be blocked, then assign it to a policy that will be applied to users.

Looking forward for your response.
