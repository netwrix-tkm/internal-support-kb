As this is a hotfix it will remain on the update option even after installing.
You can confirm the patch is installed from View Applied patches, and ingnore the entry.
Can you please confirm the server is receiving the logs?

Next to the patch, you will also need to use the client below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Let me know if you need the client on the server.

Kind regards
