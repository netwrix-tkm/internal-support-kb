@Iosif-Cristian Tornea As a first step, recommend to recreate that sync on the UI / create a new sync with the  desired entities and check if the users are imported and assigned to the proper groups. Let us know the results and also link or screenshot the logs from the AD Sync operation, in the same section.

@Flaviu-Dorin Costras - no, the AD sync was not recreated after the changes.

Please CC me(Flaviu Moldovan) on responses till Cristian T. gets back.

- Customer Name: Deloitte Services LP

- ACV: 106k+
- Components: AD Sync
- OS: macOS
- EPP Server Version: 5930
- Agent Version: N/A
- Endpoints affected: around 2000


Use case example:

The

Common Name (CN) value in AD will be changed to the global standard of “Last,
First [SamAccountName]”.  Using your account for example, here is the expected change:
 
Before
               alpotter
 
After
               Potter, Allen [alpotter]
 
Since
the Distinguished Name in AD is built using the CN, this also means the
Distinguished Name will change.  Using your account as an example, here is the expected change:
 
Before
CN=alpotter,OU=Users,OU=Practice Office,DC=us,DC=deloitte,DC=com
 
After
CN=Potter, Allen [alpotter],OU=Users,OU=Practice Office,DC=us,DC=deloitte,DC=com""


Thank you!

We had a remote session with the customer and we remade the sync without deleting the old one.
Issue persists, users that lost memberships to groups are still unassigned.

Please advise.

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer

Make a backup of the DB, and then remove the created syncs and recreate the latest one. If this still does not work, send me some slots for a remote connection during RO business hours.
