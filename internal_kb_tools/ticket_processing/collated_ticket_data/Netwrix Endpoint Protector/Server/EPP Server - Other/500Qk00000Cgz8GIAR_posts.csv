Can you please confirm why you need ssh access to the server?
SSH access is essential for performing archiving tasks when storage capacity approaches its limit. Additionally, this access is necessary for the effective management of the server.

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?
The unavailability of SSH access has hindered our ability to manage the storage component effectively. Once the disk capacity became overloaded, we encountered difficulties logging into the console, necessitating support from Netwrix for cleanup.

Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?
Yes, basically need for server back end access

What are you trying to achieve with this access?
This access will enable us to effectively manage our DLP server and enhance overall efficiency.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-07T07:44:04.000Z"
