In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records. 

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

Hello Andrei,

 

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th. 

 

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.

 

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Hello Andrei,

 

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

Hello Andrei,

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the ""Reports and Analysis"" section.

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.
Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records. 

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague's view while mine only shows 2,081.   That's 50 times different.

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records.

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

Best,

Hello Andrei,

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the ""Reports and Analysis"" section.

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.
Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

Hello Andrei,

 

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th. 

 

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.

 

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello Andrei,

 

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records. 

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.



From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records.



I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,



We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.



To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.



We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.



Best,

Hello Andrei,



Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.



We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.



I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello Andrei,



Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records. 

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

Hello Andrei,

 

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th. 

 

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.

 

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Hello Andrei,

 

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

Can you please confirm if you generate a log now on your computer does the logs appear on the Epp server?
If it does, would it be possible the for the day you mention you did not trigger the CAP policy?
You can also check the logs under Log Report to see if there are any logs for your computer on that day.

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.



From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records.



I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,



We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.



To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.



We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.



Best,

Hello Andrei,



Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.



We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.



I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello Andrei,



Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records.

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

Hello Andrei,

 

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.

 

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.

 

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Hello Andrei,

 

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

If it does, would it be possible the for the day you mention you did not trigger the CAP policy?

Hello Andrei,



We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.



To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.



We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.



Best,



Tai Ting Tseng

Hello Andrei,



Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.



We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the ""Reports and Analysis"" section.



I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?

Hello Andrei,



Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke the issue was that your EPP admin account did not have visibility over all the departments. We added the other 2 departments to you account and after that you could see the logs for the end user.

We are closing this ticket.

In addition, I use ELK to analysis the logs between my colleague and mine. From the attached screenshot we can see in between 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, he has user activities record all the way up to 500,000 while mine is less than 250,000. The logs are missing here and there for each user, for example we randomly pick a user Tian Zhou and he has 112,208 activities records at my colleague’s view while mine only shows 2,081.   That’s 50 times different.

 

From the second screenshot I compare through time. From 1/1/2025 to 3/4/2025, my colleague still got double logs compare to mine. I pick 1/14/2025 as example, his log has 70,164 records on that day while mine only has  2008 records.

 

I hope you got the idea that I have severely log missing issue from my view which makes me not able to use this tool at all. Please help to address the issue ASAP. Thank you.

Hello Andrei,

 

We have performed the test and created another user with the same right, but the issue persists. The logs still stop at 1/9, as shown in the attached screenshot for your reference.

 

To expedite troubleshooting, could you please provide multiple test steps in each correspondence rather than just one? Completing only one step per day has significantly slowed our progress - it's been almost a week with minimal advancement on resolving this issue.

 

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to a more efficient resolution process.

 

Best,

 

Tai Ting Tseng

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you please confirm the current version of your Epp server?
If it is not 5.9.4.1, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to confirm if the issue remains.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

 

Please see attached screenshot from his view, we use the same filter conditions. As you can see the logs shown all the way to Feb 27th, while mine stop at Jan 9th.

 

We log in using different accounts, my colleague is the administrator of the system, while I login as the reporter that can only view the “Reports and Analysis” section.

 

I can see logs up to March for some other users, but certain logs are missing from my view, and I can't determine which ones are missing unless I compare them with my colleague's logs. Even when I try to export the logs using the same filter conditions as my colleague, my export contains fewer logs than his

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Is it possible to share the screenshot from your colleague's view?
Is there a difference between the users you and your colleague are logging in with?
Can you also try to create a new user and check if you see the logs with that user?

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

 

Thank you for getting back to me. Let me rephrase my issue, so you can have a better understanding.

I have a problem with the Log Report on the web portal. My logs only show up to January 9, 2025. My colleague can see the same user's activities all the way through February 27th. I know these logs exist on the server, but they're not showing up in my portal view.

Please see attached screenshot for your reference.

Hello,

Can you please confirm if you generate a log now on your computer does the logs appear on the Epp server?
If it does, would it be possible the for the day you mention you did not trigger the CAP policy?
You can also check the logs under Log Report to see if there are any logs for your computer on that day.

Kind regards
