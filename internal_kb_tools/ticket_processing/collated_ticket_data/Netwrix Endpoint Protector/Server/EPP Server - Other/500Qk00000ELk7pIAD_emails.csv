Below is the feedback from our Dev team.

	Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.
	Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?
	Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.
	If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector

Hi Jay, 

 

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited. 

 

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

 

Kind regards, 

Nicoleta

Hi Support

 

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.

Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?
4. If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:

	Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.
	What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?
	While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh

It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)

Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Can you first provide any instructions that will allow customers to view driver-related instructions?

Jay

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi support 

 

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

 

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

 

Best regards 

Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Hi support 
 

Thanks for your answers.

Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

 

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

 

Jay 

 

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???


Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.


Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.

Hi Support

 

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

In addition, they want to know a little bit about the principle of EPP controlling usb-serial, please explain a little bit.

 

Thanks

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.


""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Hi

 

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.

there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

 

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

Hi Jay,

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an  ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build. 

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:


	sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
	sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	Connect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.
	After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
	cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/


	options.ini
	reprovision.db
	rights.s3db



Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 . 

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve: 

	In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release. 
	A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it. 



Kind regards

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?

Can you provide an expected completion time?

 

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

 

Jay

 

 


Julia Tsai <julia@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?5? ?? ??10:19???


Hi
TSMC log is sent to the outside and needs to be reviewed. It is currently under review.

 

 

 

Julia

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???


Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.



You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.





Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.





We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Hi Support

 

The attachment is the generated log information.

EPP Server:5.9.3.0 

EPP Agent:3.0.2.1007

Mac OS 14 M2

The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.



 

Jay

 

 


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??11:00???



Hi Support

 

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

 

Jay

 
 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???


Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:

	Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:
	EPP Server version:
	EPP Client Version:


Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".



Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.


To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response. 

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi Support

 

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.


They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

 
 


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?28? ?? ??11:04???



Hi Support

 

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.
The fifth question is asking the support vendor to regenerate the LOG.
Question 6 is under discussion.
There is currently a new problem. Their Epp Server is not connected to the License Server. How to extend the trial?

 

Jay

 

 


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?20? ?? ??5:11???



Hi André

 

TSMC's current EPP server has been successfully established.
Please provide the ""epp_change_ip.sh"" from P.18 in the Jamf distribution guide for EPP agent installation. 

 

Thank you!

Jay

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?8?16? ?? ??1:29???


Hi Jay,

Please see my responses to the questions listed below.

1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
We do have a JAMF deployment guide that lists the configuration of the JAMF profile step by step.  The customer can use this guide, please download or view the JAMF deployment guide here: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
TSMC is asking for a staging server, how should we proceed with having a staging server.
I am checking this internally and will give you a response on this question shortly.

3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For example, the installation is not completed?
(Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to view the server remotely.)
Right after clicking on ""Upload Patch"" and then when the notification ""Patch applied successfully!"" is displayed in the green box you can click on ""Live Update"" under ""Dashboard"" then you will see the progress bar with percentage displayed.  Here you can see the progress while the patch is being applied.  See below screenshots.





After the patch was applied successfully you can then click on ""View Applied Updates"". See below screenshot.


Here you will see the date and time the patch application was completed.




4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process is not very smart.
At the moment we don't have have a dedicated public web page that lists the offline patches.  We are releasing three to four general updates a year and this is announced on our website.  If you would like to make a request for this then please also raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
Unfortunately the logs did not come through, when they are attached on the email then they will be blocked.  Files being summited to us will now need to be uploaded to the attachments folder in the Netwrix Support portal.  Can I ask you to upload the logs there please?
Also, can you confirm what rights were set when the customer tested the scenario, also on which level was the rights set? (Global, Group, Computer or Device Level).

My response in the previous thread was:

""Regarding the second question.
We would need to investigate if it would be possible to block the Arduino devices on macOS.  The first approach would be to test and try to do this with the existing capabilities of Device Control. When testing this with Device Control an observation will need to be made if these devices are identified by Endpoint Protector.  If they are not recognized as any specific device types by Endpoint Protector then ""Unknown Device"" can be set to ""Deny Access"" under ""Device Control"" > "" Global Rights"" after which another observation should be made to see if they will be blocked after changing this to ""Deny Access"".""

Did the customer test the scenario with the method listed above? If not, they can set the rights on Computer level ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Rights"" instead of setting the rights on global level to Deny for unknown devices.


6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any externally connected services)
At the moment we do not have support for HA or failover architecture with Endpoint Protector.  This may be considered in the future but also please raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

Hi Support

Let me first explain the current situation.
1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in
their internal audit process.
2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools
for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there
is a list)
3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked &
files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers
expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully
blocked"".

Related replies:
*1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector
detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.*
We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.
*2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you
kindly clarify?*
TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing.
(Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like
that)
*3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page
documenting the list of supported device types.*
This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this
question.
*4.* *If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the
list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint
Protector.*
This should not be known until actual testing.
Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

Thanks
Jay

Would it be possible to give us access to the hacking tools and some basic instructions on how they are used to transfer data from macs? This way we can test the scenario within our test environment so that we can revert with more information / advice.

Hi Support

 

Let me first explain the current situation.

1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in their internal audit process.

2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there is a list)

3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked & files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully blocked"".

 

Related replies:

1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.

We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.

2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?

TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing. (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like that)

3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.

This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this question.

4. If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector.

This should not be known until actual testing.

Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

 

Thanks

Jay

Hi Jay,

Below is the feedback from our Dev team.

	Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.
	Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?
	Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.
	If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector



Kind regards

Hi Jay, 

 

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited. 

 

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

 

Kind regards, 

Nicoleta

Hi Support

 

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.

Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?
4. If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:

	Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.
	What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?
	While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh

It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)

Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Can you first provide any instructions that will allow customers to view driver-related instructions?

Jay

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?15? ?? ??12:28???


Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi support 

 

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

 

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

 

Best regards 

Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Thanks for your answers.

Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

 

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???


Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.


Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.

Hi Support

 

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

 

Jay

Hi Support

 

I uploaded a file named ""reextre0509epp.zip"", which contains the TCMC log.
In addition, they want to know a little bit about the principle of EPP controlling usb-serial, please explain a little bit.

 

Thanks

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Hi

Customer returns,
Remove the old EPP Agent, reboot, install pkg (3.0.4.0008) through Jamf and execute epp_change_ip.sh (reports normal completion).
However, there are no records reported to the server from the agent and EPP server as before.
Please help confirm which side needs to be adjusted, thank you.


 

P.S epp_change_ip.sh:

#!/bin/bash

 

### Edit this script and set the EPP server parameters in this section ###

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.


""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.


Kind regards

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""


Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Hi

 

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.

there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

 

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

 

Best regards

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?25? ?? ??11:51???


Hi Jay,

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an  ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build. 

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:


	sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
	sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	Connect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.
	After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
	cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/


	options.ini
	reprovision.db
	rights.s3db

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 . 

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve: 

	In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release. 
	A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it.

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?

Can you provide an expected completion time?

 

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

 

Jay

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???


Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.



You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.





Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.





We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

EPP Server:5.9.3.0 

EPP Agent:3.0.2.1007

Mac OS 14 M2

The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??11:00???



Hi Support

 

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

 

Jay

 
 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???


Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:

	Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:
	EPP Server version:
	EPP Client Version:


Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".



Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.


To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response. 

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

Hi Support

 

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.


They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

 
 


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?28? ?? ??11:04???



Hi Support

 

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.
The fifth question is asking the support vendor to regenerate the LOG.
Question 6 is under discussion.
There is currently a new problem. Their Epp Server is not connected to the License Server. How to extend the trial?

 

Jay

 

 


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?20? ?? ??5:11???



Hi André

 

TSMC's current EPP server has been successfully established.
Please provide the ""epp_change_ip.sh"" from P.18 in the Jamf distribution guide for EPP agent installation. 

 

Thank you!

Jay

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?8?16? ?? ??1:29???


Hi Jay,

Please see my responses to the questions listed below.

1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
We do have a JAMF deployment guide that lists the configuration of the JAMF profile step by step.  The customer can use this guide, please download or view the JAMF deployment guide here: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
TSMC is asking for a staging server, how should we proceed with having a staging server.
I am checking this internally and will give you a response on this question shortly.

3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For example, the installation is not completed?
(Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to view the server remotely.)
Right after clicking on ""Upload Patch"" and then when the notification ""Patch applied successfully!"" is displayed in the green box you can click on ""Live Update"" under ""Dashboard"" then you will see the progress bar with percentage displayed.  Here you can see the progress while the patch is being applied.  See below screenshots.





After the patch was applied successfully you can then click on ""View Applied Updates"". See below screenshot.


Here you will see the date and time the patch application was completed.




4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process is not very smart.
At the moment we don't have have a dedicated public web page that lists the offline patches.  We are releasing three to four general updates a year and this is announced on our website.  If you would like to make a request for this then please also raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
Unfortunately the logs did not come through, when they are attached on the email then they will be blocked.  Files being summited to us will now need to be uploaded to the attachments folder in the Netwrix Support portal.  Can I ask you to upload the logs there please?
Also, can you confirm what rights were set when the customer tested the scenario, also on which level was the rights set? (Global, Group, Computer or Device Level).

My response in the previous thread was:

""Regarding the second question.
We would need to investigate if it would be possible to block the Arduino devices on macOS.  The first approach would be to test and try to do this with the existing capabilities of Device Control. When testing this with Device Control an observation will need to be made if these devices are identified by Endpoint Protector.  If they are not recognized as any specific device types by Endpoint Protector then ""Unknown Device"" can be set to ""Deny Access"" under ""Device Control"" > "" Global Rights"" after which another observation should be made to see if they will be blocked after changing this to ""Deny Access"".""

Did the customer test the scenario with the method listed above? If not, they can set the rights on Computer level ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Rights"" instead of setting the rights on global level to Deny for unknown devices.


6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any externally connected services)
At the moment we do not have support for HA or failover architecture with Endpoint Protector.  This may be considered in the future but also please raise this as a point with your Account Manager.



Kind regards

Hi Support

Regarding the Usb-Serial part, we are asking them to test and respond.

I'm asking the customer for details on the hacking tools.
They seemed unwilling to provide tool details, so I tried to find the
answer through other means.

   - Attached is a record of their file transfers against hacking tools.
   The two hacking tools are tested using UART and serial console
   respectively.
   The tests are all done by connecting the USB cable and logging in
   through the screen command and using echo to record data.
   Log collection method: After reproducing the technique, collect it
   according to the steps/script you provided.

Other issues related to host performance

   1. If the logs accumulate to millions or more, how long will it take to
   search the EPP host for what a user's specified device has done (condition:
   user + device + date)?
   2. If the logs are exported through system backup, what tool is
   recommended to read the exported logs?
   3. How long will it take to find the event of question 1 from the
   exported log?

We do not have such a large amount of data to reproduce this effect.
If possible, can you send us a screenshot or video to tell the customer the
answer?

Thanks
Jay

>> Hi Jay,
>>
>> Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.
>>
>> *Customer Question:* Is your expected method to disable the use of the
>> USB-Serial device on the MAC?
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D:* *Yes, we achieve this using the device control module.
>> For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the
>> USB device and suspending it.*
>>
>> *Customer Question: *According to my understanding, devices such as
>> RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage
>> differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data
>> transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP
>> module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled
>> from the DC module.
>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>>
>>
>> *A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used. B. The
>> MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.*
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B:* *We don't monitor the
>> transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data
>> transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we
>> might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content
>> Aware Protection (CAP) module.*
>>
>>
>> *Partner Question: * In addition, the customer's environment is very
>> complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not
>> disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D: **We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere
>> with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment
>> is needed by the customer before buying our product.*

>> Hi Jay,
>>
>> Please see my responses to the questions listed below.
>>
>> 1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on
>> MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the
>> server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the
>> server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
>> We do have a JAMF deployment guide that lists the configuration of the
>> JAMF profile step by step.  The customer can use this guide, please
>> download or view the JAMF deployment guide here:
>> https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf
>>
>> 2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for
>> them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated
>> version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and
>> delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
>> TSMC is asking for a staging server, how should we proceed with having a
>> staging server.
>> I am checking this internally and will give you a response on this
>> question shortly.
>>
>> 3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline
>> updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any
>> opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For
>> example, the installation is not completed?
>> (Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to
>> view the server remotely.)
>> Right after clicking on ""Upload Patch"" and then when the notification
>> ""Patch applied successfully!"" is displayed in the green box you can click
>> on ""Live Update"" under ""Dashboard"" then you will see the progress bar with
>> percentage displayed.  Here you can see the progress while the patch is
>> being applied.  See below screenshots.
>>
>> [image: Image_2024-08-15_19-06-08.png]
>>
>> [image: Image_2024-08-15_19-09-12.png]
>>
>> After the patch was applied successfully you can then click on ""View
>> Applied Updates"". See below screenshot.
>> [image: Image_2024-08-15_19-09-39.png]
>>
>> Here you will see the date and time the patch application was completed.
>> [image: Image_2024-08-15_19-11-20.png]
>>
>>
>>
>> 4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive
>> download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new
>> version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process
>> is not very smart.
>> At the moment we don't have have a dedicated public web page that lists
>> the offline patches.  We are releasing three to four general updates a year
>> and this is announced on our website.  If you would like to make a request
>> for this then please also raise this as a point with your Account Manager.
>>
>> 5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com
>> port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached
>> the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
>> Unfortunately the logs did not come through, when they are attached on
>> the email then they will be blocked.  Files being summited to us will now
>> need to be uploaded to the attachments folder in the Netwrix Support
>> portal.  Can I ask you to upload the logs there please?
>> Also, can you confirm what rights were set when the customer tested the
>> scenario, also on which level was the rights set? (Global, Group, Computer
>> or Device Level).
>>
>> My response in the previous thread was:
>>
>> ""
>> *Regarding the second question. We would need to investigate if it would
>> be possible to block the Arduino devices on macOS.  The first approach
>> would be to test and try to do this with the existing capabilities of
>> Device Control. When testing this with Device Control an observation will
>> need to be made if these devices are identified by Endpoint Protector.  If
>> they are not recognized as any specific device types by Endpoint Protector
>> then ""Unknown Device"" can be set to ""Deny Access"" under ""Device Control"" >
>> "" Global Rights"" after which another observation should be made to see if
>> they will be blocked after changing this to ""Deny Access"".""*
>>
>> Did the customer test the scenario with the method listed above? If not,
>> they can set the rights on Computer level *""Device Control"" >
>> ""Computers"" > ""Manage Rights"" *instead of setting the rights on global
>> level to Deny for unknown devices.
>>
>>
>> 6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA
>> architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they
>> provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any
>> externally connected services)
>> At the moment we do not have support for HA or failover architecture with
>> Endpoint Protector.  This may be considered in the future but also please
>> raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

Regarding the Usb-Serial part, we are asking them to test and respond.

 

I'm asking the customer for details on the hacking tools.

They seemed unwilling to provide tool details, so I tried to find the answer through other means.

Attached is a record of their file transfers against hacking tools.
	The two hacking tools are tested using UART and serial console respectively.
	The tests are all done by connecting the USB cable and logging in through the screen command and using echo to record data.
	Log collection method: After reproducing the technique, collect it according to the steps/script you provided.

Other issues related to host performance

If the logs accumulate to millions or more, how long will it take to search the EPP host for what a user's specified device has done (condition: user + device + date)?If the logs are exported through system backup, what tool is recommended to read the exported logs?How long will it take to find the event of question 1 from the exported log?
We do not have such a large amount of data to reproduce this effect.
If possible, can you send us a screenshot or video to tell the customer the answer?

 

Thanks

Jay

Hi Jay,

Would it be possible to give us access to the hacking tools and some basic instructions on how they are used to transfer data from macs? This way we can test the scenario within our test environment so that we can revert with more information / advice.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi Support

 

Let me first explain the current situation.

1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in their internal audit process.

2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there is a list)

3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked & files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully blocked"".

 

Related replies:

1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.

We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.

2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?

TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing. (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like that)

3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.

This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this question.

4. If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector.

This should not be known until actual testing.

Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

 

Thanks

Jay

Hi Jay,

Below is the feedback from our Dev team.
Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector

Hi Jay, 

 

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited. 

 

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

 

Kind regards, 

Nicoleta

Hi Support

 

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.

Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?
4. If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:
Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh
It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)

Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.

Kind regards

Hi support 

 

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

 

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

 

Best regards 

Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Kind regards

Thanks for your answers.

Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

 

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???

Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.

Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB.

What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.

""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Kind regards

Hi

 

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.

there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

 

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

 

Best regards

Jay

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your reply, I will ask customers to test and provide files as soon as possible.

 

Jay

 

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?25? ?? ??11:51???

Hi Jay,

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build. 

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistsudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.logsudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistConnect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop
Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/

options.inireprovision.dbrights.s3db

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 . 

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve: 
In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release. A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it. 

Kind regards

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?

Can you provide an expected completion time?

 

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

 

Jay

 

 

Julia Tsai <julia@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?5? ?? ??10:19???

Hi
TSMC log is sent to the outside and needs to be reviewed. It is currently under review.

 

 

 

Julia

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???

Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.

You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.

Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.

We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

The attachment is the generated log information.

EPP Server:5.9.3.0 

EPP Agent:3.0.2.1007

Mac OS 14 M2

The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.

 

Jay

 

 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??11:00???

Hi Support

 

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

 

Jay

 
 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???

Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:
Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:EPP Server version:EPP Client Version:

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".

Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.

To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response. 

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi Support

 

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.

They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

 
 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?28? ?? ??11:04???

Hi Support

 

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.
The fifth question is asking the support vendor to regenerate the LOG.
Question 6 is under discussion.
There is currently a new problem. Their Epp Server is not connected to the License Server. How to extend the trial?

 

Jay

 

 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?20? ?? ??5:11???

Hi André

 

TSMC's current EPP server has been successfully established.
Please provide the ""epp_change_ip.sh"" from P.18 in the Jamf distribution guide for EPP agent installation. 

 

Thank you!

Jay

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?8?16? ?? ??1:29???

Hi Jay,

Please see my responses to the questions listed below.

1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
We do have a JAMF deployment guide that lists the configuration of the JAMF profile step by step.  The customer can use this guide, please download or view the JAMF deployment guide here: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
TSMC is asking for a staging server, how should we proceed with having a staging server.
I am checking this internally and will give you a response on this question shortly.

3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For example, the installation is not completed?
(Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to view the server remotely.)
Right after clicking on ""Upload Patch"" and then when the notification ""Patch applied successfully!"" is displayed in the green box you can click on ""Live Update"" under ""Dashboard"" then you will see the progress bar with percentage displayed.  Here you can see the progress while the patch is being applied.  See below screenshots.

After the patch was applied successfully you can then click on ""View Applied Updates"". See below screenshot.

Here you will see the date and time the patch application was completed.

4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process is not very smart.
At the moment we don't have have a dedicated public web page that lists the offline patches.  We are releasing three to four general updates a year and this is announced on our website.  If you would like to make a request for this then please also raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
Unfortunately the logs did not come through, when they are attached on the email then they will be blocked.  Files being summited to us will now need to be uploaded to the attachments folder in the Netwrix Support portal.  Can I ask you to upload the logs there please?
Also, can you confirm what rights were set when the customer tested the scenario, also on which level was the rights set? (Global, Group, Computer or Device Level).

My response in the previous thread was:

""Regarding the second question.
We would need to investigate if it would be possible to block the Arduino devices on macOS.  The first approach would be to test and try to do this with the existing capabilities of Device Control. When testing this with Device Control an observation will need to be made if these devices are identified by Endpoint Protector.  If they are not recognized as any specific device types by Endpoint Protector then ""Unknown Device"" can be set to ""Deny Access"" under ""Device Control"" > "" Global Rights"" after which another observation should be made to see if they will be blocked after changing this to ""Deny Access"".""

Did the customer test the scenario with the method listed above? If not, they can set the rights on Computer level ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Rights"" instead of setting the rights on global level to Deny for unknown devices.

6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any externally connected services)
At the moment we do not have support for HA or failover architecture with Endpoint Protector.  This may be considered in the future but also please raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

Kind regards

Dear Support

TSMC contact stated that the testers were unwilling to provide the name of
the hacking tool.
But they can help us look up some information.
Is there any command on Mac that can view the current hardware device
information or related logs?

Best regards
Jay

>>> Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on

>>> According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform

>>> which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB.
>>> Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to

>>> module.
>>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>>> A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
>>> B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
>>> C. Others
>>>
>>> In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many
>>> control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).

Dear Support

 

TSMC contact stated that the testers were unwilling to provide the name of the hacking tool.
But they can help us look up some information.
Is there any command on Mac that can view the current hardware device information or related logs?

 

Best regards

Jay

Hi Support

 

Regarding the Usb-Serial part, we are asking them to test and respond.

 

I'm asking the customer for details on the hacking tools.

They seemed unwilling to provide tool details, so I tried to find the answer through other means.

Attached is a record of their file transfers against hacking tools.
	The two hacking tools are tested using UART and serial console respectively.
	The tests are all done by connecting the USB cable and logging in through the screen command and using echo to record data.
	Log collection method: After reproducing the technique, collect it according to the steps/script you provided.

Other issues related to host performance

If the logs accumulate to millions or more, how long will it take to search the EPP host for what a user's specified device has done (condition: user + device + date)?If the logs are exported through system backup, what tool is recommended to read the exported logs?How long will it take to find the event of question 1 from the exported log?
We do not have such a large amount of data to reproduce this effect.
If possible, can you send us a screenshot or video to tell the customer the answer?

 

Thanks

Jay

 

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?11?6? ?? ??10:17???

Hi Jay,

Would it be possible to give us access to the hacking tools and some basic instructions on how they are used to transfer data from macs? This way we can test the scenario within our test environment so that we can revert with more information / advice.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Let me first explain the current situation.

1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in their internal audit process.

2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there is a list)

3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked & files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully blocked"".

 

Related replies:

1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.

We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.

2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?

TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing. (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like that)

3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.

This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this question.

4. If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector.

This should not be known until actual testing.

Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

 

Thanks

Jay

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?11?5? ?? ??11:21???

Hi Jay,

Below is the feedback from our Dev team.
Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector

Kind regards

Hi Jay, 

 

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited. 

 

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

Hi Support

 

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.

Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?
4. If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.

Jay

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:
Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh
It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)

Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Hi André Le

 

I will try to get the relevant information you mentioned from the customer later.
Can you first provide any instructions that will allow customers to view driver-related instructions?

Jay

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?15? ?? ??12:28???

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.

Kind regards

Hi support 

 

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

 

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

 

Best regards 

Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Kind regards

Hi support 
 

Thanks for your answers.

Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

 

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

 

Jay 

 

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???

Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.

Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Kind regards

Hi

Customer returns,
Remove the old EPP Agent, reboot, install pkg (3.0.4.0008) through Jamf and execute epp_change_ip.sh (reports normal completion).
However, there are no records reported to the server from the agent and EPP server as before.
Please help confirm which side needs to be adjusted, thank you.

 

P.S epp_change_ip.sh:

#!/bin/bash

 

### Edit this script and set the EPP server parameters in this section ###

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.

""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Hi

 

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.

there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

 

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

 

Best regards

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?25? ?? ??11:51???

Hi Jay,

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build. 

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistsudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.logsudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistConnect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop
Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/

options.inireprovision.dbrights.s3db

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 . 

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve: 
In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release. A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it. 

Kind regards

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?

Can you provide an expected completion time?

 

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

 

Jay

 

 

Julia Tsai <julia@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?5? ?? ??10:19???

Hi
TSMC log is sent to the outside and needs to be reviewed. It is currently under review.

 

 

 

Julia

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???

Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.

You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.

Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.

We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

The attachment is the generated log information.

EPP Server:5.9.3.0 

EPP Agent:3.0.2.1007

Mac OS 14 M2

The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.

 

Jay

 

 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??11:00???

Hi Support

 

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

 

Jay

 
 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???

Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:
Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:EPP Server version:EPP Client Version:

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".

Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.

To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response. 

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi Support

 

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.

They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

 
 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?28? ?? ??11:04???

Hi Support

 

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.
The fifth question is asking the support vendor to regenerate the LOG.
Question 6 is under discussion.
There is currently a new problem. Their Epp Server is not connected to the License Server. How to extend the trial?

 

Jay

 

 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?20? ?? ??5:11???

Hi André

 

TSMC's current EPP server has been successfully established.
Please provide the ""epp_change_ip.sh"" from P.18 in the Jamf distribution guide for EPP agent installation. 

 

Thank you!

Jay

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?8?16? ?? ??1:29???

Hi Jay,

Please see my responses to the questions listed below.

1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
We do have a JAMF deployment guide that lists the configuration of the JAMF profile step by step.  The customer can use this guide, please download or view the JAMF deployment guide here: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
TSMC is asking for a staging server, how should we proceed with having a staging server.
I am checking this internally and will give you a response on this question shortly.

3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For example, the installation is not completed?
(Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to view the server remotely.)
Right after clicking on ""Upload Patch"" and then when the notification ""Patch applied successfully!"" is displayed in the green box you can click on ""Live Update"" under ""Dashboard"" then you will see the progress bar with percentage displayed.  Here you can see the progress while the patch is being applied.  See below screenshots.

After the patch was applied successfully you can then click on ""View Applied Updates"". See below screenshot.

Here you will see the date and time the patch application was completed.

4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process is not very smart.
At the moment we don't have have a dedicated public web page that lists the offline patches.  We are releasing three to four general updates a year and this is announced on our website.  If you would like to make a request for this then please also raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
Unfortunately the logs did not come through, when they are attached on the email then they will be blocked.  Files being summited to us will now need to be uploaded to the attachments folder in the Netwrix Support portal.  Can I ask you to upload the logs there please?
Also, can you confirm what rights were set when the customer tested the scenario, also on which level was the rights set? (Global, Group, Computer or Device Level).

My response in the previous thread was:

""Regarding the second question.
We would need to investigate if it would be possible to block the Arduino devices on macOS.  The first approach would be to test and try to do this with the existing capabilities of Device Control. When testing this with Device Control an observation will need to be made if these devices are identified by Endpoint Protector.  If they are not recognized as any specific device types by Endpoint Protector then ""Unknown Device"" can be set to ""Deny Access"" under ""Device Control"" > "" Global Rights"" after which another observation should be made to see if they will be blocked after changing this to ""Deny Access"".""

Did the customer test the scenario with the method listed above? If not, they can set the rights on Computer level ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Rights"" instead of setting the rights on global level to Deny for unknown devices.

6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any externally connected services)
At the moment we do not have support for HA or failover architecture with Endpoint Protector.  This may be considered in the future but also please raise this as a point with your Account Manager.

Kind regards

Hi Support

There are two issues that require your priority assistance.
1. TSMC’s license expires on 11/23 and needs to be extended.
2. Their testers have always said: ""The hacking tool can transfer files by
connecting to the MAC through USB-Serial, and EPP has no records.""
Can we tell from the LOG that they really did this? Or just talk about it?

We will have a meeting with them and need to understand the details first.

Jay

Hi Support

I'm currently having issues with TSMC's window retcon.
This is the earliest question about ADB
It can be blocked when the executing program is called ADB. If ADB is
changed to BAD, the file can be transferred smoothly, and no record can be
found on the EPP.
They use the official ADB program, make a copy and change the execution
program to BAD. The instructions are as follows
*Normal ADB*
./adb push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt
*Change to BAD*
./bad push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt

*This seems to be a strange vulnerability, please tell me how to respond to
the customer first, thank you.*

Br,
Jay

>>>>> *Customer Question:* Is your expected method to disable the use of
>>>>> the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
>>>>>
>>>>> *Netwrix R&D:* *Yes, we achieve this using the device control module.
>>>>> For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the
>>>>> USB device and suspending it.*
>>>>>
>>>>> *Customer Question: *According to my understanding, devices such as
>>>>> RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage
>>>>> differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data
>>>>> transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP
>>>>> module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled
>>>>> from the DC module.
>>>>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>> *A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used. B. The
>>>>> MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.*
>>>>>
>>>>> *Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B:* *We don't monitor the
>>>>> transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data
>>>>> transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we
>>>>> might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content
>>>>> Aware Protection (CAP) module.*
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>> *Partner Question: * In addition, the customer's environment is very
>>>>> complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not
>>>>> disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?
>>>>>
>>>>> *Netwrix R&D: **We can't guarantee that another product won't
>>>>> interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging
>>>>> environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.*

Hi Support

 

I'm currently having issues with TSMC's window retcon.
This is the earliest question about ADB
It can be blocked when the executing program is called ADB. If ADB is changed to BAD, the file can be transferred smoothly, and no record can be found on the EPP.
They use the official ADB program, make a copy and change the execution program to BAD. The instructions are as follows
Normal ADB
./adb push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt
Change to BAD
./bad push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt
 

This seems to be a strange vulnerability, please tell me how to respond to the customer first, thank you.

 

Br,

Jay

Hi Support

 

There are two issues that require your priority assistance.
1. TSMC’s license expires on 11/23 and needs to be extended.
2. Their testers have always said: ""The hacking tool can transfer files by connecting to the MAC through USB-Serial, and EPP has no records.""
Can we tell from the LOG that they really did this? Or just talk about it?

 

We will have a meeting with them and need to understand the details first.

 

Jay

Dear Support

 

TSMC contact stated that the testers were unwilling to provide the name of the hacking tool.
But they can help us look up some information.
Is there any command on Mac that can view the current hardware device information or related logs?

 

Best regards

Jay

Hi Support

 

Regarding the Usb-Serial part, we are asking them to test and respond.

 

I'm asking the customer for details on the hacking tools.

They seemed unwilling to provide tool details, so I tried to find the answer through other means.

Attached is a record of their file transfers against hacking tools.
	The two hacking tools are tested using UART and serial console respectively.
	The tests are all done by connecting the USB cable and logging in through the screen command and using echo to record data.
	Log collection method: After reproducing the technique, collect it according to the steps/script you provided.

Other issues related to host performance

If the logs accumulate to millions or more, how long will it take to search the EPP host for what a user's specified device has done (condition: user + device + date)?If the logs are exported through system backup, what tool is recommended to read the exported logs?How long will it take to find the event of question 1 from the exported log?
We do not have such a large amount of data to reproduce this effect.
If possible, can you send us a screenshot or video to tell the customer the answer?

 

Thanks

Jay

 

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?11?6? ?? ??10:17???

Hi Jay,

Would it be possible to give us access to the hacking tools and some basic instructions on how they are used to transfer data from macs? This way we can test the scenario within our test environment so that we can revert with more information / advice.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Let me first explain the current situation.

1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in their internal audit process.

2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there is a list)

3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked & files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully blocked"".

 

Related replies:

1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.

We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.

2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?

TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing. (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like that)

3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.

This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this question.

4. If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector.

This should not be known until actual testing.

Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

 

Thanks

Jay

Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector

Kind regards

Hi Jay, 

 

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited. 

 

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

 

Kind regards, 

Nicoleta

Hi Support

 

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.

Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?
4. If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:
Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh
It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)

Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Hi André Le

 

I will try to get the relevant information you mentioned from the customer later.
Can you first provide any instructions that will allow customers to view driver-related instructions?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.

Kind regards

Hi support 

 

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

 

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

 

Best regards 

Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Kind regards

Hi support 
 

Thanks for your answers.

Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

 

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

 

Jay 

 

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???

Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.

Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

In addition, they want to know a little bit about the principle of EPP controlling usb-serial, please explain a little bit.

 

Thanks

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Kind regards

Remove the old EPP Agent, reboot, install pkg (3.0.4.0008) through Jamf and execute epp_change_ip.sh (reports normal completion).
However, there are no records reported to the server from the agent and EPP server as before.
Please help confirm which side needs to be adjusted, thank you.

 

P.S epp_change_ip.sh:

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.

""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""

Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Hi

 

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.

there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

 

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

 

Best regards

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build: [Inline image URL : ] https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build. 

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistsudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.logsudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plistConnect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop
Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/

options.inireprovision.dbrights.s3db

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

The customer is concerned about the USB-Serial issue because it is the key to the entire case.
Can you provide an approximate timeframe to reassure customers?

 

Thanks

Jay

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 . 

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve: 
In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release. A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it. 

Kind regards

Hi Support

Have a nice day.

Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?

Can you provide an expected completion time?

 

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

 

Jay

 

 

Julia Tsai <julia@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?5? ?? ??10:19???

Hi
TSMC log is sent to the outside and needs to be reviewed. It is currently under review.

 

 

 

Julia

 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???

Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.

You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.

Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.

We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

The attachment is the generated log information.

EPP Server:5.9.3.0 

EPP Agent:3.0.2.1007

Mac OS 14 M2

The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.

 

Jay

 

 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??11:00???

Hi Support

 

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

 

Jay

 
 

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???

Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:
Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:EPP Server version:EPP Client Version:

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".

Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.

To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response. 

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref
 

Hi Support

 

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.

They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

 
 

Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com> ? 2024?8?28? ?? ??11:04???

Hi Support

 

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.

Hi Support

I am not a developer, but I have dealt with many very strange problems from
Taiwanese customers, and I can provide suggestions for your reference.

If MAC users can change the name of the executable program ADB, then the
modification cannot be completed based on the application name.
However, you can detect actions performed in command, such as PUSH. The
user should not be able to change the action's instructions.
There shouldn't be too many commands that ADB can transmit externally. It
should be faster to detect the behavior first and then determine whether it
is ADB.
Or when controlling ADB, unconditionally block and record all commands
similar to ""./xxxx push abc.txt /sdcard/abc.txt"".

For example, add a section to the ADB condition to detect the execution of
the ""push"" string in the command. When PUSH is detected, regardless of
whether there are parameters or not, it is directly traced whether the
entire command contains an execution program similar to ADB.

Taiwan's MAC company is also concerned about the progress.
We hope to complete it before the next formal large-scale meeting, or
provide a complete explanation and time.

thank you
Jay

I forgot to tell you in my last letter that the key issue after the current
evaluation is

ADB > USB-Serial > Hacking Tools
ADB and USB-Serial are necessary functions. If the hacking tool takes a lot
of time to process, please focus on the first two items first.

thank you all

>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Customer Question:* Is your expected method to disable the use of
>>>>>>> the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Netwrix R&D:* *Yes, we achieve this using the device control
>>>>>>> module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access
>>>>>>> to the USB device and suspending it.*
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Customer Question: *According to my understanding, devices such as
>>>>>>> RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage
>>>>>>> differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data
>>>>>>> transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP
>>>>>>> module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled
>>>>>>> from the DC module.
>>>>>>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used. B.
>>>>>>> The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.*
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B:* *We don't monitor the
>>>>>>> transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data
>>>>>>> transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we
>>>>>>> might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content
>>>>>>> Aware Protection (CAP) module.*
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Partner Question: * In addition, the customer's environment is
>>>>>>> very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did
>>>>>>> not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> *Netwrix R&D: **We can't guarantee that another product won't
>>>>>>> interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging
>>>>>>> environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.*

Dear Jay,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’d like to propose a brief call to discuss the current status of this project and the possibility of extending the POC. It’s important that we align on the client’s requirements and how they match the capabilities of Endpoint Protector DLP.

While our solution is designed to protect against insider threats, some of the recent requirements seem to fall outside of our primary scope, such as controlling hacking tools. I believe it would be helpful to clarify these aspects to ensure expectations are aligned moving forward.

Could you please suggest a few time slots that work for you? I’ll do my best to adjust to your availability.

Looking forward to the discussion!

Best regards,
Nicoleta

I forgot to tell you in my last letter that the key issue after the current evaluation is

ADB > USB-Serial > Hacking Tools
ADB and USB-Serial are necessary functions. If the hacking tool takes a lot of time to process, please focus on the first two items first.

thank you all

Hi Support

I am not a developer, but I have dealt with many very strange problems from Taiwanese customers, and I can provide suggestions for your reference.

If MAC users can change the name of the executable program ADB, then the modification cannot be completed based on the application name.
However, you can detect actions performed in command, such as PUSH. The user should not be able to change the action's instructions.
There shouldn't be too many commands that ADB can transmit externally. It should be faster to detect the behavior first and then determine whether it is ADB.
Or when controlling ADB, unconditionally block and record all commands similar to ""./xxxx push abc.txt /sdcard/abc.txt"".

For example, add a section to the ADB condition to detect the execution of the ""push"" string in the command. When PUSH is detected, regardless of whether there are parameters or not, it is directly traced whether the entire command contains an execution program similar to ADB.

Taiwan's MAC company is also concerned about the progress.
We hope to complete it before the next formal large-scale meeting, or provide a complete explanation and time.

thank you
Jay

Hi Support

I'm currently having issues with TSMC's window retcon.
This is the earliest question about ADB
It can be blocked when the executing program is called ADB. If ADB is changed to BAD, the file can be transferred smoothly, and no record can be found on the EPP.
They use the official ADB program, make a copy and change the execution program to BAD. The instructions are as follows
Normal ADB
./adb push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt
Change to BAD
./bad push NOTICE.txt /sdcard/1.txt

This seems to be a strange vulnerability, please tell me how to respond to the customer first, thank you.

Br,
Jay


Jay MAi <jay@epptw.com<mailto:jay@epptw.com>> ? 2024?11?21? ?? ??10:22???
Hi Support

There are two issues that require your priority assistance.
1. TSMC’s license expires on 11/23 and needs to be extended.
2. Their testers have always said: ""The hacking tool can transfer files by connecting to the MAC through USB-Serial, and EPP has no records.""
Can we tell from the LOG that they really did this? Or just talk about it?

We will have a meeting with them and need to understand the details first.

Jay

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?11?21? ?? ??12:17???
Hi Jay,

Thank you for the feedback, we will get back to you shortly regarding the question on hardware device information.

Kind regards

Dear Support

TSMC contact stated that the testers were unwilling to provide the name of the hacking tool.
But they can help us look up some information.
Is there any command on Mac that can view the current hardware device information or related logs?

Best regards

Hi Support

Regarding the Usb-Serial part, we are asking them to test and respond.

I'm asking the customer for details on the hacking tools.
They seemed unwilling to provide tool details, so I tried to find the answer through other means.

  *   Attached is a record of their file transfers against hacking tools.
The two hacking tools are tested using UART and serial console respectively.
The tests are all done by connecting the USB cable and logging in through the screen command and using echo to record data.
Log collection method: After reproducing the technique, collect it according to the steps/script you provided.
Other issues related to host performance

  1.  If the logs accumulate to millions or more, how long will it take to search the EPP host for what a user's specified device has done (condition: user + device + date)?
  2.  If the logs are exported through system backup, what tool is recommended to read the exported logs?
  3.  How long will it take to find the event of question 1 from the exported log?
We do not have such a large amount of data to reproduce this effect.
If possible, can you send us a screenshot or video to tell the customer the answer?

Thanks
Jay


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?11?6? ?? ??10:17???
Hi Jay,

Would it be possible to give us access to the hacking tools and some basic instructions on how they are used to transfer data from macs? This way we can test the scenario within our test environment so that we can revert with more information / advice.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref

Hi Support

Let me first explain the current situation.
1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in their internal audit process.
2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking tools for testing. They said EPP cannot detect hacking tools. (That’s why there is a list)
3. If the LOG interpretation is that USB-Serial is completely blocked & files cannot be transferred, then there is a problem when TSMC testers expressed it. They did not clearly express ""USB-Serial was successfully blocked"".

Related replies:
1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.
We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.
2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?
TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing. (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like that)
3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.
This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this question.
4. If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector.
This should not be known until actual testing.
Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

Thanks
Jay

Hi Jay,

Below is the feedback from our Dev team.

  1.  Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.
  2.  Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers.  We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you kindly clarify?
  3.  Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?  The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual page documenting the list of supported device types.
  4.  If you rewrite or even write a driver through decompilation or other methods, this part of DLP should not be restricted at present.  If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint Protector


Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Please find attached the trial extension files. We usually have the possibility to extend the trial a maximum of 3 times - so let's try to make sure we validate the use cases during the next weeks. I understand this is an exception, since their use case is unique, and they required the assistance of our support team. We'll do our best to keep them interested, but let's try to insist on the fact that the trials are limited.

We'll do our best to provide the needed support to make sure they finish the evaluation in a timely manner.

Kind regards,
Nicoleta

Hi Support

LOG needs to wait for the test unit to be executed.
TSMC’s current license has expired and needs to be extended. Please help.
Their expiration date is October 20th.

In addition, in response to the issues raised by TSMC, I have provided a suggestion for your reference. If there are any errors, please correct them.

For the overall testing process, it is recommended that the following methods be used
1. Focusing first on the standard device, that is, the USB-Serial part, we hope to achieve complete disablement in a short time.
2. Hacker device control, first restrict and protect devices that can obtain drivers
3. Are there any other devices besides the web page provided last time?

Hi Jay,

Please see the below feedback from our R&D team.

We don't fully understand what this customer wants and how they are exfiltrating data to the Raspberry Pi.

Can you please send the customer this query?:

  *   Let us know which USB cable(s) you are using to connect to the device.
  *   What software are you using to access the device (screen, scp, ssh etc.)?
  *   While the device is connected and a software is using the device run the attached script: epp_collect_sys_info_mac.sh
It will create a file: epp_sysinfo.tar.bz2 on the desktop.    It will contain more info about the device tree, the running processes, loaded drivers, network connections.

I also provided your feedback of today to our R&D team.


Kind regards

Hi Support

After our ongoing communication with the customer, they informed us that the other two unidentified items were from the following listing.
(The information security unit responsible for the test was unwilling to provide the name and photo of the device)
Since many departments of the client are involved this time, the following is my personal speculation and discussion.
1. For USB-Serial devices, they need to be recognized and disabled.
2. If a function like ""Windows Administrator or Jamf"" can detect the device (the administrator can clearly see that the device exists), the customer hopes that EPP can disable the device.
3. Regarding the hardware tools in the list, the testing unit hopes to block them all, but there may be some room for discussion. Therefore, it is necessary to make a technical judgment first, and then ask business personnel to communicate.
 a. It can be done in a short time.
 b. It takes a long time to complete.
 c. Unsure or this may be beyond the expected scope.

Hi André Le

I will try to get the relevant information you mentioned from the customer later.
Can you first provide any instructions that will allow customers to view driver-related instructions?

Jay

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?10?15? ?? ??12:28???
Hi Jay,

Thank you for your email. I was out of office on Friday, 11th October please excuse my delayed response.  I will also be out of office tomorrow.

Could you please provide us with all the details of points 1 and 2? Which USB-Serial devices were connected and tested? Can you please provide the logs collected while these devices were connected and also provide us with the screenshots showing where one of these devices are recognized on EPP?  The questions raised by the customer are all questions that needs to be answered by our R&D team but they will need as much information or details from the customer concerning the tests conducted within their environment, before our R&D can provide answers.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref

Hi support

I had a meeting with TSMC today and they provided the situation from the last test as a reference.

Currently, the EPP function is jointly tested by the development unit and management unit. USB-Serial devices must be used through the development unit.

1. The development unit uses three commonly used hardware tools, all of which are USB-Serial devices. There is one that can be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen. The other two devices cannot be seen on the EPP Client Agent screen, but they can be viewed through Command and data can be transferred.

2. Since the EPP Client Agent cannot see the device, the management unit assisting in the test hopes to view the differences on the Driver through Command for your reference. Are there any relevant instructions available?

3. I hope you can provide them with a video of successfully blocking USB-Serial for their reference, so that unit managers can understand what the successful blocking status will be.

Best regards
Jay

Hi Jay,

The feedback that our Dev team provided is as follows:
""We can see that at some point a ""USB to Ethernet"" adapter is connected which we gracefully ignore. The USB to Serial adapter is not connected.""

Did the customer have the device ""Raspberry Pi"" connected while they collected the logs?

Hi support

Thanks for your answers.
Please notify me if the analysis results for the report are complete.

This may be the only important technical issue before customers purchase.

Jay


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?10?10? ?? ??7:06 ???
Hi Jay,

Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.

Customer Question: Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?

Netwrix R&D: Yes, we achieve this using the device control module. For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the USB device and suspending it.

Customer Question: According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?

A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.

Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B: We don't monitor the transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content Aware Protection (CAP) module.


Partner Question:  In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?

Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment is needed by the customer before buying our product.



Kind regards

Hi Support

Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development data through the USB-Serial device.
Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on the MAC?
According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC module.
What would be the ideal outcome?
A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
C. Others

In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this affect the EPP agent?

In addition, they want to know a little bit about the principle of EPP controlling usb-serial, please explain a little bit.

Thanks

Hi Jay,

The test build is not meant for deployment but only for testing on 1-3 computers.  Can we ask the customer to do a manual installation of the EPP client and then test the scenario please?  This is only to qualify if the test build is able to block the device.

Hi
Customer returns,
Remove the old EPP Agent, reboot, install pkg (3.0.4.0008) through Jamf and execute epp_change_ip.sh (reports normal completion).
However, there are no records reported to the server from the agent and EPP server as before.
Please help confirm which side needs to be adjusted, thank you.



P.S epp_change_ip.sh:

Hi Jay,

The below is the response from our developer working on your case.


""Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?""
Theoretically yes, but we were not able to test this, so we would appreciate it if the customer would verify if the blocking works.
In the latest logs we can see that the device is detected as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and is viewable in the EPP Notifier application. The device right is ""Allow Access"" so we can't tell if we were able to block it.


Kind regards

Hi Jay,

We checked the logs and can see that the device is now detected as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"", it has ""Allow Access"" permission.
In the last section of the logs we can also see that the agent is not communicating with the server, somehow the server IP address is not set.

Please ask the customer to uninstall the agent, then install it again and to make sure that they enter a valid EPP server IP address.  When there is communication between the EPP Server and EPP client please set Deny Access for ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)""


Kind regards

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the logs, I noticed that there are some errors.  This build should recognize the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" and under MTP it should be blocked.
I am checking the logs internally with the developer assigned to your case and will get back to you with more details soon.

Hi

The attachment is the related log of /dev/tty.usbserial-110 that you can see after connecting the USB serial and using the command ls /dev/tty.*.
there is no reprovision.db file in the /private/etc/epp/ folder.

Another question, theoretically using this Client agent can block usb-serial devices, right?

Hi Jay,

We would like to give you an update on this case.  We have prepared a test build for the customer to test with.

Please also see the below note from the developer who prepared the test build and who is also assigned to your case:

The test build detects the ""USB-Serial Controller"" device as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device, therefore please re-test the scenario by setting the Rights to ""Deny Access"" for the device type ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" on Computer level.  Update the policies on the macOS endpoint, connect the Raspberry Pi and see if access to it is still granted on the endpoint computer.

Please use the following link to download the test build: Error! Filename not specified.https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25092024/EPPMac3.0.4.0008.Notarized.tar

Before retesting the scenario, please ensure that the current EPP client is uninstalled first, restart the computer and then install the above EPP client test build.

Also please do collect a new set of logs when testing the scenario.   To collect the EPP client logs, please follow the steps by entering the below commands:

  1.  sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
  2.  sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
  3.  sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
  4.  Connect the device and while device is connected update the policies on the EPP client.
  5.  After the necessary information were captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
  6.  cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop
Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/

  1.  options.ini
  2.  reprovision.db
  3.  rights.s3db

Hi Support

The customer is concerned about the USB-Serial issue because it is the key to the entire case.
Can you provide an approximate timeframe to reassure customers?

Thanks
Jay

Hi Jay,

Our 5.9.4.0 release EPP Client is fully compatible with MacOS Sequoia release. We confirm that Netwrix provides same-day support for macOS Sequoia since September 16, 2024 with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 .

Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to resolve:

  *   In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release.
  *   A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to resolve it.


Kind regards

Hi Support
Have a nice day.
Regarding the Raspberry Pi issue raised by TSMC, is there any preliminary progress?
Can you provide an expected completion time?

In addition, I offer a simple suggestion.
TSMC adopts an offline architecture.
If you confirm it is correct, just provide them with the offline update package.

Jay

Hi
TSMC log is sent to the outside and needs to be reviewed. It is currently under review.



Julia

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?9?3? ?? 20:43 ???
Hi Jay,

We need the following information as well.

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".  Please check to see if the device is recognized by Endpoint Protector.

Error! Filename not specified.

You can also open the EPP Client on the Device Control tab while the devices is connected and here we can see if EPP is able to recognize the Raspberry Pi or Arduino devices.

Error! Filename not specified.



Please send us a screenshot of the rights set on computer level as shown in the below screenshot so that we can see which rights are set for the device types when testing.

Error! Filename not specified.



We also need the eppclient logs please, I noticed that it is not in the zip archive that you sent.  Can you please sent it to us?  You will need to upload it to the attachments section on the Netwrix Support portal.

To capture the eppclient logs please run the below commands via terminal:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second command will create the EPP client log and the thrid command will restart the EPP agent.  Reconnect the device, update the polices and then after this was captured in the event logs run the command below to copy the log file to the desktop.
cp -p /private/var/log/eppclient.log /Users/andreleroux/Desktop



Kind regards

Mac OS 14 M2
The customer uses a Raspberry Pi to connect to the Macbook via a USB to serial cable.
Error! Filename not specified.

Hi Support

Before doing this, I would like to confirm that the current version of EPP can successfully block the functions of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, right?

Jay


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?9?3? ?? ??12:49???
Hi Jay,

If the Endpoint Protector agent does not detect the USB device then we will need to collect the epp client logs and submit it to our dev team to review.

We need the following details:

  *   Operating System and OS version of endpoint machine:
  *   EPP Server version:
  *   EPP Client Version:

Please confirm that the device is not listed when you filter on computer name under ""Device Control"" > ""Devices"" > ""Filters"" > ""Last Computer"".

Error! Filename not specified.

Since it is not possible for us to have a remote session with the customer to perform the necessary troubleshooting we will rely on them to perform the mentioned actions to collect logs.


To collect the client logs, can you kindly ask the customer to follow the steps outlined in my previous email?

Hi Jay,

Thank you for your response.

Regarding question 5, to collect logs please ask the customer to follow the guide in the attached.  Please also make sure that full disk access is granted to the EPP agent.

It is also possible to create log files for the EPP Mac agent and DPI via terminal with the following commands:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

The first command will terminate the EPP client, the second and third commands will create the EPP client and the DPI logs respectively and the fourth command will restart the EPP agent.

Please ask the customer to also send us the following files under /private/etc/epp/
options.ini
reprovision.db
rights.s3db

Error! Filename not specified.



Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ELk7p:ref

Hi Support

There is a burning question regarding TSMC's testing.
This is related to the progress process of their purchase.

They use serial console devices such as Raspberry Pi/Arduino for testing.
Log in to the Raspberry Pi through the terminal, and copy the file content and save it to the Raspberry Pi using echo.
Confirm that the EPP Agent does not show that the device has been detected. After the agent completes the report, there is no log on the EPP server that the device is connected at this point in time.
How can I block such devices? (Set on DC and CAP)
If possible, please provide a screenshot, thank you.

Test command: ls /dev/tty.usb*
-> After finding the device, use screen /dev/tty.usbXXXX 115200 to log in online.

Hi Support

Regarding TSMC’s issues, 1 to 4 are currently resolved.
They are now testing with 5.8.1.0.
The fifth question is asking the support vendor to regenerate the LOG.
Question 6 is under disc

Hi Nicoleta

Have a nice day.
We are discussing this issue with TSMC senior management, including the
hacking tools you mentioned.
This should be the sudden thought of the tester.
Preventing hackers should not be the responsibility of tools like DLP/MAM.
So we've been trying to get testing back on track.

Please put aside the question of hacking tools for now. There are a few
basic questions that must be answered.
1. ADB cannot detect the file after changing its name.
2. ""Normal"" Usb-Serial blocking (Log is currently asking management for
assistance)
3. How long does it take to search a large number of Logs? (More than one
million data)
4. Back up to storage. How to quickly search the log?

If necessary, I can organize the questions in an Excel sheet for easy
tracking.

After we get a response from the management, we will discuss the details if
necessary.

Many thanks
Jay

> *A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.*

> *Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B:* *We don't monitor the

> *Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere with

Hi Nicoleta

We have finished the meeting with TSMC today and will pass the content to
you and the support team later.
TSMC's license has expired and needs to be extended.
I need to trouble you about this part first.

Thanks

>> Hi Support
>>
>>
>>
>> Let me first explain the current situation.
>>
>> 1. Last time I asked TSMC to provide a LOG, but it is currently stuck in

>>
>> 2. In addition to USB-Serial, TSMC testers also released two hacking

>>
>>
>>
>> Related replies:
>>
>> *1. The latest logs from the test build confirms that Endpoint Protector
>> detects the USB Serial device and is also able to block it.*
>>
>> We will ask TSMC’s window to confirm again with the test unit.
>>
>> *2. We don't fully understand what you mean by this statement, could you
>> kindly clarify?*
>>
>> TSMC’s test unit mixed USB-Serial with other hacking tools for testing.
>> (Maybe it’s due to internal attack and defense drills or something like
>> that)
>>
>> *3. The answer for this is no, if you are referring to the user manual
>> page documenting the list of supported device types.*
>>
>> This is a paraphrase from a conversation with TSMC, please ignore this
>> question.
>>
>> *4.* *If the device is recognized by the operating system and is in the
>> list of supported device types, then we can control it with Endpoint
>> Protector.*
>>
>> This should not be known until actual testing.
>>
>> Their testers don't seem to be very clear about this part either.

>> Hi Jay,
>>
>> Please see the feedback / answers from our Dev team below.
>>
>> *Customer Question:* Is your expected method to disable the use of the
>> USB-Serial device on the MAC?
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D:* *Yes, we achieve this using the device control module.
>> For USB devices on macOS we do this by obtaining exclusive access to the
>> USB device and suspending it.*
>>
>> *Customer Question: *According to my understanding, devices such as
>> RS232 only perform single-end data transmission mode with voltage
>> differences through TX/RX, which is a completely different mode from data
>> transmission on USB. Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP
>> module of EPP to recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled
>> from the DC module.
>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>>
>> *A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.*
>> * B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.*
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D response to point A & point B:* *We don't monitor the
>> transferred data, we merely disable the USB device. However, if the data
>> transfer is done using a well known application such as ""scp"" or ""ssh"" we
>> might be able to monitor that application exit point using the Content
>> Aware Protection (CAP) module.*
>>
>>
>> *Partner Question: * In addition, the customer's environment is very
>> complex, and many control programs like Jamf are installed (they did not
>> disclose others).  Will this affect the EPP agent?
>>
>> *Netwrix R&D: We can't guarantee that another product won't interfere
>> with Endpoint Protector, that's why an evaluation in a staging environment
>> is needed by the customer before buying our product.*

>> Since this is a new feature, my customers and I have some doubts.
>> First, the goal is to prevent the MAC from transmitting some development
>> data through the USB-Serial device.
>> Is your expected method to disable the use of the USB-Serial device on
>> the MAC?
>> According to my understanding, devices such as RS232 only perform
>> single-end data transmission mode with voltage differences through TX/RX,
>> which is a completely different mode from data transmission on USB.
>> Therefore, theoretically it is impossible for the CAP module of EPP to
>> recognize this protocol. This device can only be disabled from the DC
>> module.
>> What would be the ideal outcome?
>> A. MAC cannot see the USB-Serial device, so it cannot be used.
>> B. The MAC can see the USB-Serial device, but cannot use it.
>> C. Others
>>
>> In addition, the customer's environment is very complex, and many control
>> programs like Jamf are installed (they did not disclose others). Will this
>> affect the EPP agent?

>>
>> Please be aware of the following issues that the team is working on to
>> resolve:
>>
>>    - In rare edge cases wireless network adapters might be duplicated in
>>    EPP Notifier. This is a minor issue with no impact on functionality. This
>>    issue will be addressed in the next Netwrix Endpoint Protector release.
>>    - A recent change in macOS triggers a misleading pop-up when the EPP
>>    agent attempts to enumerate printer devices. Despite the prompt, Netwrix
>>    Endpoint Protector can still manage print events, even if the user selects
>>    ""Deny""—the network printer remains under control. This issue is not
>>    exclusive to Endpoint Protector, and we are collaborating with Apple to
>>    resolve it.

Hi Support & Nicoleta

We had a meeting with TSMC and Taiwan APPLE today.
Let me briefly describe the general content of the meeting.

It was the IT department that had the meeting with us, and the information
security department that was responsible for the testing.
The IT department provides clean computers (with Jamf and anti-virus
software installed), and the information security department tests whether
there are loopholes that can allow data to be transferred externally.
After the people in the information security department get the MAC, they
can directly connect the device and use it as a general user. There was no
escalation of privileges or other actions beyond control during the process.
The managers of the IT department hope to solve the problem of the
information security department as soon as possible and proceed with the
next step of the procurement process. Even some ""extreme"" methods can be
used, such as disabling certain processes.

The meeting still discussed three issues, ADB transfer, USB-Serial, and
hacking tools.

   1. ADB issues
   This should be the proper function of the product.
   I mentioned last time that you can disable commands containing Push,
   which should be more efficient than simply detecting strings containing
   ADB. At least TSMC can accept this approach.
   2. USB-Serial
   In principle, they will use Usb-Serial to connect to the Raspberry Pi,
   operate in URAT mode, and copy and paste information to external devices
   through echo commands.
   Are they completely blocked when asking them to confirm a normal device
   connection.
   3. Hacking Tools
   If EPP cannot block hacking tools in the driver, can it be blocked in
   the process?
   Or can EPP disable URAT behavior through kext?

Apple will assist with several things (question from TSMC).
1. Regarding USB restrictions, is there a finder, or is it possible to
disable USB directly from a lower level?
2. If a user installs a new USB device, does Apple have any process to let
IT staff know what type of device the MAC thinks it is?

Regarding the above problems, we need to first know whether EPP can solve
it or not.
If there is any unclear information in the description, please reply to me
directly.

Thanks
Jay

>>
>> Have a nice day.
>> We are discussing this issue with TSMC senior management, including the
>> hacking tools you mentioned.
>> This should be the sudden thought of the tester.
>> Preventing hackers should not be the responsibility of tools like DLP/MAM.
>> So we've been trying to get testing back on track.
>>
>> Please put aside the question of hacking tools for now. There are a few

>> 1. ADB cannot detect the file after changing its name.
>> 2. ""Normal"" Usb-Serial blocking (Log is currently asking management for

>> 3. How long does it take to search a large number of Logs? (More than one
>> million data)
>> 4. Back up to storage. How to quickly search the log?
>>
>> If necessary, I can organize the questions in an Excel sheet for easy
>> tracking.
>>
>> After we get a response from the management, we will discuss the details
>> if necessary.
