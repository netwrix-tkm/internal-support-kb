The prospect sent us the following message:
The following error occurred when trying to access the browser. Since it was an urgent matter, I disabled the agent. In which menu of the solution can I determine which policy needs to be fine-tuned to continue testing?

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","Stefania said the customer opened another ticket and that we should close this one.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","EPP Server - Other","","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Airpak","Stefania Oltean","2024-09-25T09:17:04.000Z","2024-09-26T14:57:22.000Z"
