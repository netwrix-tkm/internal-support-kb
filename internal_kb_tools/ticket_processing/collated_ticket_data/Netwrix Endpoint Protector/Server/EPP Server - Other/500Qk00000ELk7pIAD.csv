"500Qk00000ELk7pIAD","00417887","Support Ticket","Compilation of questions raised by TSMC","The previous case was closed due to an operational error, so I will resubmit it.

About TSMCâ€™s testing.Because there had been a period of time, some questions were raised several times.
Some letters staying at the cososys domain name cannot be delivered.
I have listed the questions that need to be answered at once in this letter for easy organization.

1. TSMC uses a system called Jamf to deliver installation programs on MAC. The problem is that the program cannot put the information about the server IP in the config, so the dispatched Client cannot connect to the server. Do you have any good suggestions or solutions?
2.TSMC is still stuck on version 5600. Since it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to re-apply for the deployment image file, can you provide an updated version of the file for download? To prevent them from making mistakes and delaying testing (the latest version was last informed of 5810).
3. Currently, as long as the file is uploaded successfully during offline updates, the system will not have an error message. Is there any opportunity to provide more detailed information on offline updates? For example, the installation is not completed?
(Customers who need to update offline usually cannot let you use Putty to view the server remotely.)
4. Is there any opportunity to provide a timely offline update archive download page? At present, every offline update requires us to find a new version on Live Update and then ask you for the update package. The process is not very smart.
5. I previously asked you to test the problem that the ""USB emulation com port"" device cannot be blocked. Is there any progress? I have re-attached the LOG file tested by the manufacturer in the attachment.
6. TSMC mentioned some management-level issues, such as the use of HA architecture. If they enter the formal implementation stage, can they provide corresponding exclusive image files? (They will not open any externally connected services)

PS. Since TSMC's testing spans several different departments, please forgive us for the sometimes slow response.
