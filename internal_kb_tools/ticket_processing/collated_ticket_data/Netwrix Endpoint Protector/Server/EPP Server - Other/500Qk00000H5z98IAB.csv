"500Qk00000H5z98IAB","00424051","Support Ticket","Need Help In Uninstalling EPP Client","Hello Team,

We had installed the EPP on on-prem server, but due to a technical issue with our lab server, the EPP server has become inaccessible. To address this, we have set up a temporary server for EPP and now need to uninstall the existing clients from our laptops. However, when attempting to uninstall the EPP client, the wizard prompts for a password, which we do not have, preventing us from removing the current client.

Could you advise if there's an alternative way to uninstall the existing EPP clients from the laptops?
