This is regarding an issue that occurred on customer's side. 
The status on the DC--> Computers list is reflected as ""Licensed"" and offline. But when we check the license list, we can see that there is not license occupied by that computer. 

My insights on this: PC which are not occupying license but marked as licensed in ""Computers"" list (DC), are mostly ""Offline"" for long time.

Total licensed computers are more in count than number if license occupied. 
Please assist on this. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","The status on the DC--> Computers list is reflected as ""Licensed"" and offline. But when we check the license list, we can see that there is not license occupied by that computer.
