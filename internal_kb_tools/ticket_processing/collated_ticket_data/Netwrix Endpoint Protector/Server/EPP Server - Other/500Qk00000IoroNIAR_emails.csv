Hi Iosif,

I am available after a 10:30 am PST session I have with Flaviu.  Not sure if you want to transfer the case to him since I might be a similar issue.  This case was on our development server whereas other case with Flaviu is on production server.

Regarding the issue in this ticket, the network adapters from the EPP server were missing. We re-added them from the backend and after that it worked.

We are closing this ticket.
