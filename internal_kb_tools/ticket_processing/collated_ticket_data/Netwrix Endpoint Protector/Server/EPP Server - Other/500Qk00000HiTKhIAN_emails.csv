Thank you for your patience!

The engineering team was able to reproduce this scenario on our side. The issue is in the Alert creation , ""Check all"" checkbox in the Administrator section.
A task was created for the fix, but we don't have an ETA yet.
As a workaround , please edit the Alerts , uncheck all Administrators and Save the Alert without any Administrators. Edit again and manually check each Administrator that needs to receive the Alert without using the ""Check all"" checkbox.

Please let me know if the workaround works until the fix is implemented.

Hi Karl,

Thanks for the update!
Please let me know if the behaviour stays the same, because in that case I will have to open an internal investigation for it.

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your patience!

The engineering team was able to reproduce this scenario on our side. The issue is in the Alert creation , ""Check all"" checkbox in the Administrator section.
A task was created for the fix, but we don't have an ETA yet.
As a workaround , please edit the Alerts , uncheck all Administrators and Save the Alert without any Administrators. Edit again and manually check each Administrator that needs to receive the Alert without using the ""Check all"" checkbox.

Please let me know if the workaround works until the fix is implemented.

It wont let me save with none checked





Also every time I uncheck myself and just leave root and save, when I open it up again I am already checked again. I have tried to uncheck myself 10 times now, but it keeps checking mine.

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your patience!

The engineering team was able to reproduce this scenario on our side. The issue is in the Alert creation , ""Check all"" checkbox in the Administrator section.
A task was created for the fix, but we don't have an ETA yet.
As a workaround , please edit the Alerts , uncheck all Administrators and Save the Alert without any Administrators. Edit again and manually check each Administrator that needs to receive the Alert without using the ""Check all"" checkbox.

Please let me know if the workaround works until the fix is implemented.

Hi Karl,

Thanks for the feedback!
What if you deleted the current alert and re-created it? Would that be possible?

It wont let me save with none checked

[cid:image001.png@01DB3CBF.0B7504C0]

Also every time I uncheck myself and just leave root and save, when I open it up again I am already checked again. I have tried to uncheck myself 10 times now, but it keeps checking mine.

Hi Karl,

Thank you for your patience!

The engineering team was able to reproduce this scenario on our side. The issue is in the Alert creation , ""Check all"" checkbox in the Administrator section.
A task was created for the fix, but we don't have an ETA yet.
As a workaround , please edit the Alerts , uncheck all Administrators and Save the Alert without any Administrators. Edit again and manually check each Administrator that needs to receive the Alert without using the ""Check all"" checkbox.

Please let me know if the workaround works until the fix is implemented.
