Customer name is PrivatBank.
They tried to gather logs from macOS computer today at 10:31 GMT+2.
But since this time they cannot download this artifact (logs) with the error ""File not Found"".
What could be the reason for such a delay?
Would it be possible to search for this artifact on the EPP server backend to download it from there?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-10T13:59:52.000Z"
