I have an update regarding the Administrator Phone number format.
In the 5.9.4.1 server version (the next patch that we are going to release), the validator for Administrator Phone Number input will be modified and it will accept the following format ""(000) 000-0000"" as well.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Spencer,

I don't have any news from the engineers regarding the changes to the characters accepted for the phone number but I will have some details for Monday.

I will send you a zoom meeting invitation for Monday 10:00 AM PDT in order to discuss about the server migration and the other issues.

Best regards,
Emil
