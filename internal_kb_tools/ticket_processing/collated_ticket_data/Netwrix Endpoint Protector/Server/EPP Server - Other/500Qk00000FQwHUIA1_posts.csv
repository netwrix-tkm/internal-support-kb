This happened at least 3-4 times and I hat to apply the boot disk at 100% clear procedure.
Previous to 5810 or 5900 our manager had periodic calls with the customer to apply the backend security updates.

What happens:
1. Customer upgrades the EPP server.
2. Checked for backend security updates(ALL).
3. A list is returned.
4. The customer tries to apply them
5. After waiting a period of time and searching again the same backend security updates appear.
Looplike behavior, and they do not apply.

We checked in the backend and it seems that the boot partition is close or at 100% full.","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-01-10T19:22:41.000Z"
