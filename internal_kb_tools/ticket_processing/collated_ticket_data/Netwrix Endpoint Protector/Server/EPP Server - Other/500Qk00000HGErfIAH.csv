I'm experiencing an issue with a backup v1 task I kicked off on the evening of the 19.10.2024 around 5pm but the task still hasn't completed and its stuck on 99%. 

Also, one of our daily reporting tasks went into a loop from about 11pm on the 19th till 12pm today and then it stopped. It might be due to the stuck backup task.

Kindly assist with checking the cause of the issue?

Kind regards
