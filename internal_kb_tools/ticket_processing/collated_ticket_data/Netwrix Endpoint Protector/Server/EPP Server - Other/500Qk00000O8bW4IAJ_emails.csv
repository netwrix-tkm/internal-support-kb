I found a location to download the CA certificate from the EPP UI. Are you using macOS? If so, please refer to the following link for Deep Packet Inspection Certiﬁcate on macOS: 

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/ContentAwareProtection/DeepPacket.htm

If you are using Linux, there is also steps to update CA certs under Deep Packet Inspection Certificate on Linux on the same page on the link provided above.

Also you will find more details on certificate installation and management on Linux under Additional Resources section under Deep Packet Inspection Certificate on Linux. 

I am going to be out of office on Monday and Tuesday of next week and unfortunately booked for this afternoon today. Would it be possible to schedule a remote session for Wednesday 23rd of April?

Please let me know if this information is helpful and or you still need to schedule a remote session.

I don’t need to download the CA from EPP, I need to upload the root CA and the issuing CA that were used to generate the SSL certificate I need to use for the web server. On my old server, the Certificate is properly chained, and on my new one it is not, even though I uploaded the entire certificate chain when I uploaded the certificate and the private key.

Subject: Replace TLS certificate [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0O8bW4:ref ]

Hello Jeff,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please provide steps you used to reproduce the issue?

Will you please check the following locations to towards configuring and generating certificates:

Appliance-> Server Maintenance-> Client Registration Certificate

Appliance-> Server Maintenance-> Server Certificate

System Configuration -> System Settings -> Server Certificate Stack

System Configuration -> System Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection Certificate

I also researching further into what other certificates locations are present in the EPP UI and will get back to you on what I find.

Also, what time would you be available to schedule a remote session on Friday, April 18th? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
