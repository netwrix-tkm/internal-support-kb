Hi Emil,

A lot of printers have been rediscovered (about 6000), while many of them do look the same, they have distinct serial numbers, users, and computers so I think we can close this off now. Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind Regards,
Pete

Hello Pete,

Please let me know if the local printers seem to be duplicating again during the next week.
If they are looking good, please let me know if this ticket can be closed.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Pete,

I don't have yet an update from the engineers regarding the deletion of the devices where the last seen is older than a certain age.
But we can schedule a meeting for Tuesday or Wednesday in order to remove the duplicates.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Pete,

I can remove the local printers as well.
Regarding the deletion of devices where the last seen is older than a certain age, I will have to ask the engineers if this can be done safely.

I will get back to you with an update for this Thursday or Friday.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

It looks like ""Local Printers"" is suffering a similar problem, there are thousands of entries for ""USB Printing Support"" but the serial numbers/device codes do look different to each other.

Another question I had was whether it is possible to delete devices where the Last Seen is older than a certain age? I was thinking anything not seen in over two years.

Thanks,
Pete
