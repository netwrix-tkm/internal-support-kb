"500Qk00000NaeeQIAR","00440679","Support Ticket","Issue with server being unavailable","Good afternoon, 

Ever since we migrated the server to AWS, we have an issue once every 7 days where the server is unreachable and it says 504 Gateway Time-Out. Rebooting the server normally fixes it - after about six hours. So we will reboot the machine, wait about 6 hours and then this message goes away. Peformance is also not great, it is very close to click on something, wait 5 minutes for it to respond, click on something else, wait for it to respond. Do you have any ideas on what I can do to make this stop happening?","","The customer told us that their EPP Server is being unavailable from times to times","I discovered that they were using an appliances with less than the minimum resources that the EPP Server requires.
The customer increased the resources on the EPP Server.
The resources were optimized during today's session.

Waiting for the customer to confirm if everything works as expected","The server resources had to be increased and optimized","High Load/Scalability Limitation","Emil Podar","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","33.5","Closed - Resolved","The Coding Network","Kristen Sherrill","2025-04-02T02:19:17.000Z","2025-05-05T13:39:13.000Z"
