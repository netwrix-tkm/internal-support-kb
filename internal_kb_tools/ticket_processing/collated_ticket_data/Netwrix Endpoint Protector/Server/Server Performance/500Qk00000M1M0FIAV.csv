"500Qk00000M1M0FIAV","00436174","Support Ticket","Duplicated devices","Hi, one of our servers is listing over 10000 network printers and another 10000 serial port devices (which look like printers). During our recent migrations, it was noted this was a now fixed bug, and on one of the servers, these duplicates were deleted. Please can the same be done here?

We have a separate issue where I have deleted some System Administrators and when re-syncing, the previously deleted users aren't returning. I understand the usefulness of this feature but there are some users which I do need to be restored. This is server ID GC8AOQGR.

Thanks,
Pete","","The customer is facing some issues with duplicate computers. 
Also the customer removed some Admins synced from AD and they are not able to sync the users again.","a remote session will be scheduled in order to investigate this further
the customer requested to keep the ticket open until the end of the week in order to check if there are any more duplicated devices

We removed duplicate devices and we'll have one more meeting in order to check and make sure that the device number will not increase too much.
Will check if all the network printers can be remove from Device Control -> computers in order to check if duplicates will still appear.","Solved by removing duplicates from the backend","","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","21.1","Closed - Resolved","NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit","Pete Taylor","2025-02-18T16:07:33.000Z","2025-03-11T17:24:56.000Z"
