 We already have one ticket 00411000, open under another user, JJ, however our EPP Infrastructure is not functioning and Support's Number from your Site is not picking up. Can we have a supervisor contact me to discuss options as we cannot continue to have a critical system down as it's impending our Bank's ability to function securely.","","","","Solved during remote session","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","126.0","Closed - Resolved","Timberland Bank","Jesse Shumate","2024-07-08T16:51:28.000Z","2024-11-11T17:44:42.000Z"
