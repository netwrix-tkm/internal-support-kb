We have received an update on the Denylist issue from our devs:

Does this happen on several machines?
When it worked in the past, was it deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after you deployed it using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. We recommend removing the EPP agent and installing it back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if you want to install using MDM you should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.

Yes, multiple machines. I am pretty sure it worked with MDM and manual
installation in the past, and then they both went down. I will verify
tomorrow on a test device with manual installation to let you know. By the
extension, you mean the Extension ""allow"" button on System Preferences,
right?

Yes there should be a pop-up with Network Extensions that needs to be allowed in order for the EPP client to work properly.

Yes there should be a pop-up with Network Extensions that needs to be allowed in order for the EPP client to work properly.

Yes, multiple machines. I am pretty sure it worked with MDM and manual installation in the past, and then they both went down. I will verify tomorrow on a test device with manual installation to let you know. By the extension, you mean the Extension ""allow"" button on System Preferences, right?

Hi Ismail,

We have received an update on the Denylist issue from our devs:

Does this happen on several machines?
When it worked in the past, was it deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after you deployed it using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. We recommend removing the EPP agent and installing it back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if you want to install using MDM you should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.

Please find below the commands to generate logs on a macOS machine:

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself or reproduce the issue a few times. Once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

Thank you! We will wait to hear back from you.

Yes there should be a pop-up with Network Extensions that needs to be allowed in order for the EPP client to work properly.

Yes, multiple machines. I am pretty sure it worked with MDM and manual installation in the past, and then they both went down. I will verify tomorrow on a test device with manual installation to let you know. By the extension, you mean the Extension ""allow"" button on System Preferences, right?

Hi Ismail,

We have received an update on the Denylist issue from our devs:

Does this happen on several machines?
When it worked in the past, was it deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after you deployed it using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. We recommend removing the EPP agent and installing it back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if you want to install using MDM you should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.

Yes, multiple machines. I am pretty sure it worked with MDM and manual installation in the past, and then they both went down. I will verify tomorrow on a test device with manual installation to let you know. By the extension, you mean the Extension ""allow"" button on System Preferences, right?

Hi Ismail,

We have received an update on the Denylist issue from our devs:

Does this happen on several machines?
When it worked in the past, was it deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after you deployed it using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. We recommend removing the EPP agent and installing it back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if you want to install using MDM you should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.

The previous logs were sent for the computer that multiplied. This case is regarding the Denylist that doesn't apply.

We would need separate logs for the 2 issues in order to investigate them.

Hi Ismail,

Please find below the commands to generate logs on a macOS machine:

Terminal commands to create the log file:
sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself or reproduce the issue a few times. Once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue reproduced and send them to us. We will then raise the issue internally with our devs to further investigate this behavior.

Hi Ismail,

Please find below the commands to generate logs on a macOS machine:

Terminal commands to create the log file:

sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this please allow the issue to reproduce itself or reproduce the issue a few times. Once this happens please collect the logs with the below commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop

Yes there should be a pop-up with Network Extensions that needs to be allowed in order for the EPP client to work properly.

Yes, multiple machines. I am pretty sure it worked with MDM and manual installation in the past, and then they both went down. I will verify tomorrow on a test device with manual installation to let you know. By the extension, you mean the Extension ""allow"" button on System Preferences, right?

Hi Ismail,

We have received an update on the Denylist issue from our devs:

Does this happen on several machines?
When it worked in the past, was it deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after you deployed it using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. We recommend removing the EPP agent and installing it back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if you want to install using MDM you should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.
