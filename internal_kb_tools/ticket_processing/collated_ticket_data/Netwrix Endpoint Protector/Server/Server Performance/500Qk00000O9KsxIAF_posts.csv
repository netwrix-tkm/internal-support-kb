Could you please confirm which region the server for our portal (<a href='https://c4krxty.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/' target='_blank'>https://c4krxty.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/</a>) is hosted in? Our customer is experiencing slow performance and would like to explore migrating to a local region.

Also, could you provide a brief explanation of how system maintenance and external storage works?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-17T07:06:40.000Z"

We have in the meanwhile provided the partner with details on how to configure Audit Log Backups and External Storage, and why these features would be used and the benefits of these features.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-17T17:40:51.000Z"
