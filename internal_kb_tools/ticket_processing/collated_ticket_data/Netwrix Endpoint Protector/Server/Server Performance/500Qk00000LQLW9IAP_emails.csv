Please let me know if you had a chance to look over the previous email.

We have received notifications in AWS that your EPP server is reaching 90% memory usage sometimes.

This may usually be caused by:
- policies not being properly configured/tuned
- file shadows
- optimization issues

Please let me know if you have availability this week for a remote session so we can take a look together.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- upgraded the EPP server from 5700 to 5941(latest version)
- rebooted the EPP server
- cleared space in the backend
- set Audit Log Backups to also backup and remove logs older than 1 month from the EPP server(currently there were almost 1.5 mil logs - this may have caused performance issues)

What remains to be done: When you have time please upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version. The latest version can be downloaded from System Configuration -> Client Software.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Colin,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we did the following:
- upgraded the EPP server from 5700 to 5941(latest version)
- rebooted the EPP server
- cleared space in the backend
- set Audit Log Backups to also backup and remove logs older than 1 month from the EPP server(currently there were almost 1.5 mil logs - this may have caused performance issues)

What remains to be done: When you have time please upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version. The latest version can be downloaded from System Configuration -> Client Software.

We will leave this ticket open a few more days to make sure that everything is okay.

Hi Colin,

Please let me know if you had a chance to look over the previous email.

We have received notifications in AWS that your EPP server is reaching 90% memory usage sometimes.

This may usually be caused by:
- policies not being properly configured/tuned
- file shadows
- optimization issues

Please let me know if you have availability this week for a remote session so we can take a look together.
