Customer name is PrivatBank.
Recently, we had a ticket ""00418033 Computers seems ""Licensed"" even after EPP automatically released license"".
In that case, your team just deleted the ""false licensed"" from Device Control with a MySQL query.
Could we arrange the remote session to repeat this process, please?","","","","Solved from the server's backend","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","11.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-20T11:40:39.000Z","2024-10-01T11:09:25.000Z"
