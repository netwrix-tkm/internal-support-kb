Could you please confirm which region the server for our portal (<a href='https://c4krxty.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/' target='_blank'>https://c4krxty.hosted.endpointprotector.com/index.php/</a>) is hosted in? Our customer is experiencing slow performance and would like to explore migrating to a local region.

Also, could you provide a brief explanation of how system maintenance and external storage works?","","2025.04.17:
We have not learned any additional information other than what is given in the initial description.  We need to know the end customer's name in order to check the region in which their EPP Server Appliance is hosted.  We have in the meanwhile provided the partner with details on how to configure Audit Log Backups and External Storage, and why these features would be used and the benefits of these features.","2025.04.17:
We are waiting on the partner to respond and provide us with the name of the end customer.
