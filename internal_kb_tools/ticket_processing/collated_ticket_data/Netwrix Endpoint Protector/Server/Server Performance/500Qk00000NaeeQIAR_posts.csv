Ever since we migrated the server to AWS, we have an issue once every 7 days where the server is unreachable and it says 504 Gateway Time-Out. Rebooting the server normally fixes it - after about six hours. So we will reboot the machine, wait about 6 hours and then this message goes away. Peformance is also not great, it is very close to click on something, wait 5 minutes for it to respond, click on something else, wait for it to respond. Do you have any ideas on what I can do to make this stop happening?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-02T02:19:18.000Z"

The customer increased the resources on the EPP Server.
The resources were optimized during today's session.

Waiting for the customer to confirm if everything works as expected","","","","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-04-15T18:14:35.000Z"
