@WaitingOnEngineer

Does this happen on several machines? Not really clear in the description when it worked, when it was deployed with MDM? Or it worked before and not working anymore after the customer deployed using agents with MDM? According to the logs the network extension is not installed properly. Judging by the error received it might be that EPP's network extension is not allowed to be installed on that machine. I would remove EPP and install back manually first. And make sure extensions are not forbidden on that machine. After that, if the customer wants to install using MDM they should make sure the proper settings/configurations related to allowing network extensions are in place.
