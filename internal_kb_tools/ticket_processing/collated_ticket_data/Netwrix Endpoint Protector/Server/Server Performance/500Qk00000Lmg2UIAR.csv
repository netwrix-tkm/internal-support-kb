We've observed that our Netwrix instance consistently goes down for approximately 20 minutes each night between 1:30 AM and 2:00 AM. Additionally, as of 1:30 AM this morning (SA time), the instance has been down and has not recovered. We are currently unable to access the platform via its URL: (<a href='https://2jn87cd.hosted.endpointprotector.com/' target='_blank'>https://2jn87cd.hosted.endpointprotector.com/</a>).  

Could you please investigate this issue urgently?  

Best regards,","","","","Server down due to load.
