In the meeting we have uninstall the latest EPP client for Linux and test the CAP policy that was assigned. 

During the session we couldn't observe any slowness or internet access being blocked. 

As we agreed please monitor the other users and if they encounter any other errors, please let us know.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-05-13T11:14:46.000Z"
