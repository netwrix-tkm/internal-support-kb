This didn't happen prior to the migration and I have done all the backend updates, along with server reboots etc. Might be worth a quick check?


Some of my colleagues have also noticed that since the migrations, our SIEM is not receiving logs from any server. I have checked the SIEM settings and they were moved across and still correct. This is the info I've been given:
""Since Cososys/Netwrix upgrade no logs are being received in Logpoint SIEM. The IP addresses are correct in Logpoint, the SIEM Integration details are correct in Cososys. From Logpoint we ran a tcpdump from one of the cososys hosts and didn't receive anything.""

Thanks,
