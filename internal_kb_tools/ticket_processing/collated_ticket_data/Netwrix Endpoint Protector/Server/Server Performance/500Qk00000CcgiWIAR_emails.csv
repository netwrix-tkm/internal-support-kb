Well, today we had a user get blocked for something that was suspected to be an SSN.  I wasn't able to use the logs to see what really happened.  But in this case I was able to figure out what happened.

I think we are fine for now.

Hi Kevin,

From what I can tell you applied the vulnerability patch right before the logs stopped showing up. As per the last notice from Netwrix, we are working on a fix for this issue.
As soon the patch will be made available you can apply it to restore normal functionality
Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
