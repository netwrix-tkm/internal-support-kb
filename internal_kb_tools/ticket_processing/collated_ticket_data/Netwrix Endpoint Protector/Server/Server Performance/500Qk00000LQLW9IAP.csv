"500Qk00000LQLW9IAP","00434494","Support Ticket","EPP Memory alert in AWS","Hi,
We have received AWS alerts on EPP side regarding the memory usage in AWS of your EPP server.
The Memory usage seems to reach 90% sometimes.","","We did the following:
- upgraded the EPP server from 5700 to 5941(latest version)
- rebooted the EPP server
- cleared space in the backend
- set Audit Log Backups to also backup and remove logs older than 1 month from the EPP server(currently there were almost 1.5 mil logs - this may have caused performance issues)

What remains to be done: When you have time please upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version. The latest version can be downloaded from System Configuration -> Client Software.

Optimized EPP server.","Waiting till next week to make sure that everything is okay and then we will close the ticket.
