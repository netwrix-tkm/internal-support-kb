This Group which includes  VDIs only and after  enabling that setting ,  we have experienced extreme  slowness on all  VDIs ( both from Win 10 and Win 11 ) . We  turned off this setting and apparently the problem of slowness has been resolved .  We  want to ask from EPP support that if this printing setting was the cause of the problem .","","during the remote session, we checked all Citrix services running on a terminal and created the MTP scanning exception app list.
the customer needs to raise an internal change request in order to enable the setting and as I proposed we should have the meeting right when the setting gets enabled so we can gather logs.","waiting on the customer to create a change request internally so we can test the exception list","The slowness was fixed with the items added to the scanning exception list","","Eduard Nut","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","42.1","Closed - Resolved","OneMain Holdings Inc.","Imran Khan","2025-01-21T16:18:23.000Z","2025-03-04T18:16:15.000Z"
