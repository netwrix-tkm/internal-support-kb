During our recent migrations, it was noted this was a now fixed bug, and on one of the servers, these duplicates were deleted. Please can the same be done here?

We have a separate issue where I have deleted some System Administrators and when re-syncing, the previously deleted users aren't returning. I understand the usefulness of this feature but there are some users which I do need to be restored. This is server ID GC8AOQGR.

Thanks,
Pete","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-18T16:07:35.000Z"

Will check if all the network printers can be remove from Device Control -> computers in order to check if duplicates will still appear.","","","","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-03-04T17:17:04.000Z"
