Can you please schedule a support session with our new customer Loh Services.

The onboarding session has already been scheduled for 9-Jul. Please have a session and adjust the Endpoint Protector server settings to cover 12.000 endpoints before that date. The customer bought the Active Data Defence+ bundle.

Please schedule the meeting with:
Sven Lorenz: lorenz.s@loh-services.de
Michael Lou: lou.m@rittal.se
