- upgraded the EPP server from 5700 to 5941(latest version)
- rebooted the EPP server
- cleared space in the backend
- set Audit Log Backups to also backup and remove logs older than 1 month from the EPP server(currently there were almost 1.5 mil logs - this may have caused performance issues)

What remains to be done: When you have time please upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version. The latest version can be downloaded from System Configuration -> Client Software.
