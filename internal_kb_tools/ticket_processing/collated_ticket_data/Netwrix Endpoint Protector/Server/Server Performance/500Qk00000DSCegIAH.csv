"500Qk00000DSCegIAH","00415825","Support Ticket","Slow response to pull Excel/CVS report","Hello, 

I need to pull an Excel/CSV report of all the USB Storage devices. There is over 3000 listed (3147). However, in your reporting when you click on Excel or CSV it will only export out the amount shown in the view at that time example: 50/100/500. I assume I have to select show All in order to be able to Excel/CSV export. However the system just spins loading, and then the web browser says the page isn't responding.
I've asked our azure admin if they see any resource issues but they say it looks fine.

In addition our Azure admin asked to see if youhave updated azure deployment information… it has been two years since we uploaded your “image”. Asking if you have an image with azure vm agent Or tasks to install the azure vm agent?  That way we would have more insight into the vm. 

Thank you for your time.","","","","information was provided to the customer","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","","","57.8","Closed - Resolved","Albany International","Justin Packard","2024-07-23T19:02:11.000Z","2024-09-19T13:54:04.000Z"
