partner Inxpire has an trial on premise installation where they want to install hypervisor drivers in order to speed up performances.
Hypervisor is xcp-ng xen (similar to Citrix Xen Server).
Would it be possible? Do they need your direct support to get ssh access?

Kind Regards,
Veronica Conti","","","","The partner requested that the case be closed.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Server","Server Performance","NONE","","12.9","Closed - Resolved","CIPS MSP","Veronica Conti","2024-10-30T15:27:48.000Z","2024-11-12T12:35:34.000Z"
