Hi Emil,

Thanks for your help last week. The CPU usage has massively reduced on the affected server and printers are only up to 177, and is now staying below 20% (but I'm happy to leave the extra cores on it).

Unfortunately, less luck with the SIEM integration, we could ping the server but when running a tcpdump listening on the SIEM IP, no traffic was leaving the EPP server:

Hi Emil,

Thanks for your help last week. The CPU usage has massively reduced on the affected server and printers are only up to 177, and is now staying below 20% (but I'm happy to leave the extra cores on it).

Unfortunately, less luck with the SIEM integration, we could ping the server but when running a tcpdump listening on the SIEM IP, no traffic was leaving the EPP server:

Hi Emil,

 

Thanks for your help last week. The CPU usage has massively reduced on the affected server and printers are only up to 177, and is now staying below 20% (but Iâ€™m happy to leave the extra cores on it).

 

Unfortunately, less luck with the SIEM integration, we could ping the server but when running a tcpdump listening on the SIEM IP, no traffic was leaving the EPP server:

Pete
