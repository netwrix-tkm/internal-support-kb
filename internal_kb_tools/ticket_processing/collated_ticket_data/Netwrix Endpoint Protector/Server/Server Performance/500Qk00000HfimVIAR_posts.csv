partner Inxpire has an trial on premise installation where they want to install hypervisor drivers in order to speed up performances.
Hypervisor is xcp-ng xen (similar to Citrix Xen Server).
Would it be possible? Do they need your direct support to get ssh access?

Kind Regards,
Veronica Conti","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-30T15:27:49.000Z"
