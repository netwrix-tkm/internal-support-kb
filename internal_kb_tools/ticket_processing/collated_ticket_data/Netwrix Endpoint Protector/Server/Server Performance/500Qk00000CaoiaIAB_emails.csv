Hi Danielle,

We hope you are doing well.

Please find below the communication regarding this issue:

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
 
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.

Our devs are already looking into this issues and I have informed them that you are affected by it too. I will get back to you as soon as I receive an update on this.

Hi Danielle,

We hope you are doing well.

Please find below the communication regarding this issue:

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.

Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.

Our devs are already looking into this issues and I have informed them that you are affected by it too. I will get back to you as soon as I receive an update on this.

I received approval to upgrade the live server as an emergency event.  It has been upgraded and logs (including backlogs) are flowing to the server as expected.  Thanks!

Hi Danielle,

Thank you for letting us know! Happy to hear that the logs are present/received now.

Please let me know if everything is working correctly on the Live server after applying the fix there as well. I will leave the time interval we scheduled for the remote session reserved, just in case, until we receive confirmation from your side that everything is okay.

I received the notification of the updated Hotfix.  I have successfully applied it to my test server and am seeing expected logs.  I will submit a change event and apply the hotfix to my production server tomorrow morning.  I do not believe a support session is required.
