Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday in order to investigate this.
I will have to ssh on the EPP Server in order to investigate what can cause the issue. In order to be able to ssh on the server during our remote session, you will have to allow the port 62828 for the EPP Server in AWS (the port can be opened only for your IP).
Probably the server does not have enough resources for the amount of computers where the EPP Client is installed or the resources are not optimized.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Kristen,

I just sent you an invitation for another remote session for Monday.
Please let me know if the EPP Server started and if the UI is more responsive after the resources were increased.

Hello Kristen,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday in order to investigate this.
I will have to ssh on the EPP Server in order to investigate what can cause the issue. In order to be able to ssh on the server during our remote session, you will have to allow the port 62828 for the EPP Server in AWS (the port can be opened only for your IP).
Probably the server does not have enough resources for the amount of computers where the EPP Client is installed or the resources are not optimized.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Kristen,

Please let me know if the EPP Server started and if it works as expected.
Also, let me know if we can schedule another remote session for Tuesday or Wednesday in order to optimize the EPP Server's resources. 

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Kristen,

Let me know if we can schedule a remote session for Thursday or Friday in order to investigate this.
I will have to ssh on the EPP Server in order to investigate what can cause the issue. In order to be able to ssh on the server during our remote session, you will have to allow the port 62828 for the EPP Server in AWS (the port can be opened only for your IP).
Probably the server does not have enough resources for the amount of computers where the EPP Client is installed or the resources are not optimized.

Best regards,
Emil
