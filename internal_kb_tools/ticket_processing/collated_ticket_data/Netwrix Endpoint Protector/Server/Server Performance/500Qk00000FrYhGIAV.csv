The Backup that is being taken on External Storage hosted in ZS environment is showing three entries: Shadows/Audit Log Backup / System Backups.
Need to understand if these consist of Appliance Configuration Backups or these are only logs.
Please help us understand what is in System Backups & Shadows.
Thanks
