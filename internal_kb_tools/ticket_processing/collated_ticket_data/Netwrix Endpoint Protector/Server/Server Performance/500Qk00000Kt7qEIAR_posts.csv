This Group which includes  VDIs only and after  enabling that setting ,  we have experienced extreme  slowness on all  VDIs ( both from Win 10 and Win 11 ) . We  turned off this setting and apparently the problem of slowness has been resolved .  We  want to ask from EPP support that if this printing setting was the cause of the problem .","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-21T16:18:25.000Z"

the customer needs to raise an internal change request in order to enable the setting and as I proposed we should have the meeting right when the setting gets enabled so we can gather logs.","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-01-27T16:48:03.000Z"
