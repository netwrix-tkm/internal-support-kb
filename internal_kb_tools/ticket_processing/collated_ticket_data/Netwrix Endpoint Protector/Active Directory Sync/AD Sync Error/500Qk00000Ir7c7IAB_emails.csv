If the user is already created as an EPP type, it will not be changed to the AD type after the sync. With that said, even if the user is of EPP type, if all details are similar to those in AD, and ignore AD authentication is set to no, it should still work with the AD password.
As a first test, I would turn the ignore AD Authentication on, save, then toggle it back to off and save again.
If it still does not work after that, the next step is to remove the users from the backend and sync them again after a reboot.
Is the server hosted on their end or by us?

Thank you,
