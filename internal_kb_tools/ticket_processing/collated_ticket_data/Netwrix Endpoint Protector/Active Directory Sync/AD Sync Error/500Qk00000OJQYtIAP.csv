we have tried to sync our AD authentication for admin logins, but we are facing issue, please help for the same on priority basis.

We asked the customer if he saved the configuration and only after that he tested the connection.
In case that he already did it, we also asked for a screenshot of the error that he is receiving.
---
We received the screenshot and we decided that we need to schedule a remote session to check the issue.

Remote session scheduled for April 23, 12:30 PM IST

After we replaced the User: (with the username only, not also the domain appended) and Active Directory Administrators Group: (with the group name from the AD), the test connection was successful.","22.04:
We await the customer's response to see if he did the steps mentioned (saving the AD configuration and only then testing it).
We also wait for the screenshot off the error.

We wait to see when the customer is available for the remote session.
