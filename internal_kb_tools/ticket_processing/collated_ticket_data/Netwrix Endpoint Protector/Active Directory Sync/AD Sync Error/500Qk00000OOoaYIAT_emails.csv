Thank you for your patience. Could you please let me know if prior to the movement of the DLP appliance, did you have a good connectivity between the EPP Server and the AD?

Also, I will need to know more details about this problem. Could you explain what exactly VNET is and where exactly does the EPP appliance sits in your system's architecture?

Which virtualization environment are you hosting the appliance on?

One more thing, please provide us a more in-depth explanation on what the Site-to-Site tunnel set up is so we can understand better the situation.

Hi Marian,

The DLP server image shared by CoSoSYS team is deployed on our Azure cloud. We were facing this issue earlier also and your team suggested to move this to the VNET from where we can connect to our domain controller. This is the old ticket ID 00435723 please check once.

Can we connect to discuss about this further, I can explain about the complete setup?

Hello Davendra,

Thank you for your patience. Could you please let me know if prior to the movement of the DLP appliance, did you have a good connectivity between the EPP Server and the AD?

Also, I will need to know more details about this problem. Could you explain what exactly VNET is and where exactly does the EPP appliance sits in your system's architecture?

Which virtualization environment are you hosting the appliance on?

Hi Marian,

 

The DLP server image shared by CoSoSYS team is deployed on our Azure cloud. We were facing this issue earlier also and your team suggested to move this to the VNET from where we can connect to our domain controller. This is the old ticket ID 00435723 please check once.

 

Can we connect to discuss about this further, I can explain about the complete setup?

Hello Davendra,

Thank you for your patience. Could you please let me know if prior to the movement of the DLP appliance, did you have a good connectivity between the EPP Server and the AD?

Also, I will need to know more details about this problem. Could you explain what exactly VNET is and where exactly does the EPP appliance sits in your system's architecture?

Which virtualization environment are you hosting the appliance on?

One more thing, please provide us a more in-depth explanation on what the Site-to-Site tunnel set up is so we can understand better the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

As discussed during the remote session, please allow the min 6 hours that you've allowed for the sync to take place and let me know how it goes.
