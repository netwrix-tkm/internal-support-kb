"500Qk00000EW8iMIAT","00418324","Support Ticket","After Migration 18>22 sync with local AD not possible","Hi, 

this morning a technician helped us to migrate the backupV2 from ubuntu18 to ubuntu22. The management itself is working now. 

But the connection to the local Active Directory doesn't work anymore, now. We switched the both servers several times (by changing the vSphere network online/offline).

The old server ubuntu18 has no problem to connect. The sync work's well.
The new server is not able to connect to the directory servers. There is also no entry in their's system log.

In the Web UI we constantly get messages like this

Bind to Active Directory failed. Check the login credentials and/or server details. AD said: Can't contact LDAP server

We switched back to the old server. Please come back back to us for remote support. Maybe there is a suitable time slot (time zone Berlin) for you? You may send me an Zoom Invitation then.
