We are facing an issue where two admins from the admin group synced with EPP still appear as Usertype: EPP and not an AD one, they are also unable to use the password on the AD to login. I will attach a print for you.

Best regards,","","2 AD users are not syncing correctly and are not able to log in using the AD password.
