"500Qk00000DElduIAD","00415378","Support Ticket","Active Directory Authentication - Syntax for the Active Directory Administrators Group parameter","Hello,
i am trying to configure the AD Sync for the EP Administrators. 
I configured all the parameters, and checking the connection with AD using the Test button, it works, i receive the following response: Connection Successful!
But trying to sync the AD Administrators using the ""Sync AD Administrators"" button, i receive the error: Group not found or no users present in group!

I tried different groups, also the built-in Domain Admins just as a test, with the same result.

Also, I tried different syntax (eg. using the pure group name, the Canonical Name, the DistinguishedName, but the result it is the same, with the error above.

The user used for the AD connection it is a domain admin.
I cannot find in the EP documentation which syntax i must use.

Could you give me a trick?

Thank you.
