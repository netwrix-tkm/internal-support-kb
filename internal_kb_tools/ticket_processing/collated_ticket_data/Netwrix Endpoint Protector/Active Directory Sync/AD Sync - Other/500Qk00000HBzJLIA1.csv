We need your help to  confirm following query from customer.
1. Could the cloud hosted EPP (SaaS) can integrate with an on-premise Active Directory for Active Directory synchronization.
2. If the integration with an on-premises active directory is possible, does it require or need a connector in their on-premises environment?

Could you please provide detailed information or any available documentation regarding this integration capability and any specific requirements.

Thank you for your help.
