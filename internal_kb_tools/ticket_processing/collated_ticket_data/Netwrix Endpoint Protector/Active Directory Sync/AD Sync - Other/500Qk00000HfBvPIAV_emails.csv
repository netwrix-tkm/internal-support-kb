Hello Marco,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We can submit a feature request to our Management team, but you will have to send us a new ticket with how this feature should be added and any other details that you want to add.

In the meantime we will proceed with the closure of this case.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi, we decided to revert the setting because it doesn’t make sense to ask all the admin users to reset the password just because of EPP.

Is it possible to make a design change request for this?

Hello Marco,

Thank you for getting back to us.

The enforced password option, was the one responsible for the password reset, so it can be enabled to all the users.

Do you have access now ? Have you manage to reset the password?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Marco,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

The enforced password option, was the one responsible for the password reset, so it can be enabled to all the users.

Do you have access now ? Have you manage to reset the password? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi, can you please reopen the ticket?

 

During the call yesterday we’ve changed the password policy as per below and it was working fine during the day.

However, today, it is enforcing all accounts to change the password. I had to change the root account’s password to get in as I had no other option to get in there.

 

Can you please help?



 

Marco
