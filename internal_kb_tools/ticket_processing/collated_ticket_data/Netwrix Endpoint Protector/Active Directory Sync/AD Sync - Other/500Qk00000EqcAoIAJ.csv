"500Qk00000EqcAoIAJ","00418981","Support Ticket","Group Domain Users doesnt show up in the Users under Device Control - Users","We want to apply user policies to the default AD group ""Domain Users"" . Unfortunately the Group doesnt show up when listing the useres under Device Control -> Users. The group isn´t listed in the ""Group""-Coloumn.  The AD Sync ist working correcly, if we add a group to one of the folders and add users to it, the group is showing up after the sync. Linked devices are successfully unblocked.
How can i use the ""Domain Users"" Group.","","","","M	The customer tried to sync users from a primary group. (This is not possible in epp due to a limitation)
Recommended creating a new group (The customer already tried that but they do not want to add the users manually)
Recommended to add the devices to a custom class to allow it for all users.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Active Directory Sync","AD Sync - Other","","","4.8","Closed - Resolved","Barthelmeß EDV-Service GmbH","Alexander Barthelmess","2024-08-23T12:24:23.000Z","2024-08-28T08:17:49.000Z"
