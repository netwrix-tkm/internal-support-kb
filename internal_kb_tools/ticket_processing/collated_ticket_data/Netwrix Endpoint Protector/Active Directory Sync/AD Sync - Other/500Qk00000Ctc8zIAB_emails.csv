I have a similar case and I would like to ask for some more details, if they are the same I will have to involve our server team.
After how long do they reappear and what is the console showing in the Last seen column for them in Device Control -> Computers?
Are they part of an AD server? If yes, are they still present in there?

Around the next time of sync is when they repopulate. We have some as old as this one here:
[cid:image001.png@01DAD2C3.D6797270]

The sync is set to be every 15 minutes with Azure Active Directory. While we may have SOME devices that haven't been properly removed, most are not in Azure AD but are still re-appearing within Endpoint. This one for example is showing in Endpoint:

It sounds very similar to the other case where the fix was to upgrade to the latest server version and apply the hotfix.
Have you already upgraded to the latest server version and have you applied the latest hotfix?
