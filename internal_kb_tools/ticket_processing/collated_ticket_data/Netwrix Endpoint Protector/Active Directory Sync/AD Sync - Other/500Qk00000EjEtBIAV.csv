Up until recently we had Azure AD sync working in which we had a Security Group configured which any members assigned the group would then be granted access to the EPP platform.

This no longer appears to be working/configured. Are you able to confirm why this would be the case; as nobody has access to the platform to make these types of changes. This has been working without fail for at last 2 years.","","","","MTP option turned off.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Active Directory Sync","AD Sync - Other","NONE","","56.1","Closed - Resolved","CVC Capital Partners Ltd","Denver Diedericks","2024-08-21T09:46:07.000Z","2024-10-16T12:48:03.000Z"
