"500Qk00000GAqvPIAT","00421894","Support Ticket","Automate the process of applying policies for users","I want to ask whether Endpoint Protector can automatically apply policies for users through syncing groups from Azure Active Directory. Currently, I am applying policies manually by adding each device/username to the policy. 
For example: if I add a user to the PII group in Azure Active Directory, Endpoint Protector will apply the corresponding policy through the sync between Azure AD and Endpoint Protector.","","","","AD Azure","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Active Directory Sync","AD Sync - Other","NONE","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","TrustingSocial","Dang Duong","2024-09-24T07:45:07.000Z","2024-09-24T08:32:49.000Z"
