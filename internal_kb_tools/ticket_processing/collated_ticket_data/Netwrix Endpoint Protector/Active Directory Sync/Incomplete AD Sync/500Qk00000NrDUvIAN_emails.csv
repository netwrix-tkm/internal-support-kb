Thank you for confirming your availability, I scheduled a remote session for today at 11 AM Berlin time and sent you the meeting invitation.

As during the remote we may need to access the EPP Server via SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
-Putty
-Zoom


Kind regards
