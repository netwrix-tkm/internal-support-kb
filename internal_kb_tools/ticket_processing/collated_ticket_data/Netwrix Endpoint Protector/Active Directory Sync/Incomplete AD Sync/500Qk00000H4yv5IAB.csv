We checked that the users are in the group however, they do not get added when we try to apply the policy by group.","","The customer has an issue in Content Aware Alerts.
For context, they use Entra. In the alerts section, whenever they select a group, only a few users get selected.
This doesn't happen in CAP policies, and the groups look OK in DC.
We tried this with local groups, and it worked correctly.
We replicated this internally, and we had the same issue(see screenshot)

A remote session was held with the customer to gather mysql data for 2 users. These were added to the escalated case.

Had a remote session with the help of Augustina, the connections in mysql were correct, we will keep investigating.","waiting on R&D to further investigate","the issue was caused by the same user logging in from 2 different devices at the same time","","Botond Biro","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Active Directory Sync","Incomplete AD Sync","","","139.4","Closed - Resolved","Joby Aero, Inc","Vatsal Gupta","2024-10-15T21:32:44.000Z","2025-03-04T07:00:25.000Z"
