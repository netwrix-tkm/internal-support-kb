Hi, 

Could you please let me know on which environment you succeeded to replicate the issue ? Also, please give me access to the screenshots. 

I have tried to replicate it on 15.125 but without success. 


Thanks.

  Could you please check the machine on which was connected last time with the user angel.oliva or the user jeffrey.hoover?


If they weren't connected to any machine, they won't be automatically selected when the group is checked.
               
The relationship between the entities in alerts differs from the relationship between the entities on the CAP page.
 
Please provide me the following information:

	 - 	check the user properties (provide a print screen with them)
	 - 	SELECT * FROM clientuser WHERE usernale = 'jeffrey.hoover' G;

	 - 	identify the last_machine_id field;
	 - 	search after the last machine on with the user was connected:
	 - 	SELECT * FROM clientmachine WHERE id = last_machine_id G;

	 - 	replace the last_machine_id with the value found at point 2.a.

Do the same steps for the user  jeffrey.hoover.

During the remote session on February 06, I reviewed the relationships between entities and everything appears to be in order. However, when a group is selected in the CAP policies entities, not all of the users in that group are being checked.

One potential issue (not checked on the remote) could be the duplication of the user.

Boti, as I understood, the EPP server is hosted by us.
Please, when you have time, verify the user by running the following queries: (provide results of each query):


--- CODE ---SELECT id, username FROM clientuser WHERE id = 2814;
SELECT id, username, last_machine_id FROM clientuser WHERE username = ""name""; --- CODE ---

Replace the name with the result of the first query. It should be something like: christopher.bradford.



I need this information to determine the next steps of the investigation.

Regards,
Augustina

Hi Boti,

I hope you are well.

For Augustina to be able to further investigate this, she will need to connect again to the server, however, she can only connect up to 16:00 RO time.
As I understood, this server is hosted by us, so there is no need to have a customer call, however, we will need to have their confirmation that we can connect remotely to their server, involving dev and someone from support and or devops team.

Please get us this confirmation in order to further investigate this.

Thank you,
Cristi

During today's remote session, we continued investigating the user( with id 2814) connectivity issues regarding the policy and the machines.

It appears that he is connected to two machines simultaneously. (To a Win machine and a macOS machine)

When a group is selected, the user is automatically verified on the Policy side, and this verification depends on which machine the user is logged into at that time.
It is logged on the machine with the highest last seen value.
The last seen timestamps for both machines differ by only a few milliseconds or seconds. (I have attached 2 screenshots)

This indicates that the user frequently switches between machines. As a result, if a group is checked on a Mac policy while the user is logged into a Windows policy, it won't be automatically verified.

This is a normal behavior.

The customer should be informed about this.
