For context, they use Entra. In the alerts section, whenever they select a group, only a few users get selected.
This doesn't happen in CAP policies, and the groups look OK in DC.
We tried this with local groups, and it worked correctly.
We replicated this internally, and we had the same issue(see screenshot)

A remote session was held with the customer to gather mysql data for 2 users. These were added to the escalated case.","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-01-10T16:16:34.000Z"
