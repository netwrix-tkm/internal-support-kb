The customer just sent this update.

""I have uploaded video of another machine when issue occurred named epp_issue.mkv and logs of the machine named epp_tp3-1220.zip . The issue time is around 01:19.00 to 01.19.24 PM IST. Please refer the logs.""

Also to add more information to this case:

The behaviour is, that epp is not able to restrict clipboard when the issue occurs, and it happens randomly.  The customer have set a regex to restrict any text being copied into clipboard. The customer also reported that when they log out of the one user and log into another user then the issue is most likely to occur.

I have checked the rights priority, it is on computer priority and the computers are selected in cap policy so the policy should be enforced on all users.  Please see the screenshots of regex config, clipboard config and priority level in the attachments folder.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-14T09:19:23.000Z","2025-02-14T09:19:23.000Z","false","false"
