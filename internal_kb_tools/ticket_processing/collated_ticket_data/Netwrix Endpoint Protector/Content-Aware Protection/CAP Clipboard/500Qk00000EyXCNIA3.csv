I am reaching out regarding an issue in the POC stage with the customer, E-Solution.

We have encountered a problem where, despite having a policy configured to block and report Clipboard of Source code, still able to copy paste source code.

Could you please assist in investigating this issue to ensure that our policy is being enforced correctly?

Attaching video of config for reference.
