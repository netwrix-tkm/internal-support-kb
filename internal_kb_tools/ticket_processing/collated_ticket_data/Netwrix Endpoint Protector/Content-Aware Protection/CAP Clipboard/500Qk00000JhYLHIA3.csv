seit dem Update auf Server Version 5.9.4.1 können wir keinen SQL-Code mehr per Zwischenablage in das SQL Management Studio mehr einfügen.

Copy and Paste in beispielsweise Notepad klappt weiterhin. Auch können wir den SQL Code in eine neue Outlook-Email einfügen.

Sobald wir die Maus auf das SQL Management Studio fokussieren ist im Rechte-Maustaste-Menü sofort ""einfügen"" nicht mehr verfügbar.

Die einzige CAP Richtlinie, die wir aktiviert haben, steht auf ""nur protokollieren"". Im CAP Log sehen wir, dass in der Zwischenablage SQL Code erkannt wurde.","Try to paste SQL code into SQL Management Studio via the clipboard.

Copy and paste in Notepad, for example, still works. We can also paste the SQL code into a new Outlook email.

As soon as we focus the mouse on SQL Management Studio, ""paste"" is no longer available in the right-click menu.

The only CAP policy that we have activated is set to ""report only"". In the CAP log, we can see that SQL code was detected in the clipboard.","- Connected with the customer and as the only policy that was applied on their computer was ""Report only"", raised the topic with the R&D team","Check internally with the R&D team for a solution","It was due to the activated ""paste restrictions"" of the clipboard in the CAP policy.
