We have a use case from a customer who wants to block the copying and pasting of sensitive data from document applications (such as Excel or Word) containing sensitive data to the WhatsApp Desktop client on macOS.

For our CAP test policy for macOS, we have configured the following:

Exit point: WhatsApp Desktop
Credit Card as denylist from predefined content
Clipboard: ON
Detect Source Code: ON
Detect Images: ON
Apply Paste restrictions to all monitored applications: ON
Policies Entities: Selected the computer.
However, when we updated the policies on the selected computer and tested the following flow:

Copy content that includes a credit card number from an Excel file (Notification blocked displayed).
Paste it into the WhatsApp Desktop client chat (content copied before pasting as an image) and click send, the image is sent to the receiver.
This also occurs when we copy a credit card number from Word and then paste it into the WhatsApp Desktop client chat. The number (credit card number) copied can be sent to the receiver.

Have we configured this incorrectly, or is this a known issue or limitation? Is there a workaround for this?","","","","fixed","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Clipboard","","","144.0","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Denni Prima Putra Roli","2024-06-03T07:17:00.000Z","2024-10-25T08:17:58.000Z"
