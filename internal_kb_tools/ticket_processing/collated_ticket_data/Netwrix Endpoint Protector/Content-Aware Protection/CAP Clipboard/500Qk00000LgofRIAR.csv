We can client audit this week and need to rectify before this thursday.","","The official Linux build ""2.4.4.1004"" did not enforce restrictions on the clipboard with a basic / simple regular expression configured to detect all text and prevent it from being placed into the clipboard.  

We also observed that EPP clients on Ubuntu 22.04 endpoints randomly stops functioning, the EPP notifier is not responding.
When user click on the EPP icon via RMB then nothing happens, the three function menu does not appear.
The service needs to be forcefully stopped or killed, then started again in order for EPP to resume working then after a a few minutes the symptoms repeats.

more than 90 Ubuntu 22.04 systems are affected by this issue.","Test builds were provided.  The last test build ""v2.4.4.1"" resolved the issue with clipboard.  Case can be closed.","Test builds were provided. The last test build ""v2.4.4.1"" resolved the issue with clipboard. Case can be closed.
