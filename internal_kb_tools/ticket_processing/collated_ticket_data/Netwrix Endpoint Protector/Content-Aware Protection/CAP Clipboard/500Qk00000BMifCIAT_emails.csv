Thank you for contacting our support department. 

Could you please let us know the server version and the client version that you are using ? 

Also, if you turn off the apply paste restrictions on all monitored applications, is the transfer still possible ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have checked how the issue is reproducing and tried the following steps to try to fix it:

	verify that the EPP client have the correct rights 
	checked if the DPI certificate is enabled
	add more exit point and file extensions to your policy

As we agreed please gather the logs using the application downloaded or you can generate them using the following commands: 
1. sudo touch /var/log/eppclient.log
2. sudo touch /var/log/eppsslsplit.log
3.1 sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
REPRODUCE THE ISSUE
3.2 sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
