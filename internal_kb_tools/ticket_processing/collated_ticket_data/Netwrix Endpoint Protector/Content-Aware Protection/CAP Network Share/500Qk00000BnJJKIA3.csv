Customer name is Avis.
They added the network share folder to the File Location Denylist to block all outgoing transfers from this folder.
But it is still possible to download files from this folder to the user PC, what is unwanted.
Customer want to set up a policy to block ALL outgoing transfers from network share folder and allow users to upload files to the network share at the same time.
Is it possible to do?
We tried to use the Network Share option in the CAP policy, but as it described there, it applies to file transfer TO and FROM network share, what is unwanted,
Is it possible to apply it to file transfer only FROM the network share?","","","","Unfortunately that exact use case is not possible.
Indeed, the Network Share exit point in CAP will apply to file transfers TO and FROM network shares (not just FROM).
If it helps you can create network share allowlists for certain file paths, but this will also apply TO and FROM network shares.
The closest feature is file location denylist.","","Alin Decean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Network Share","","","5.1","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-06-13T12:32:10.000Z","2024-06-18T14:27:12.000Z"
