Hello! There are no client logs attached.
As a first step, they should install the latest client and see how it behaves.
From the attached video it looks like the customer is using 6.2.2.1006 and he doesn't get ""File copy"" logs either (as suggested in the description). 
As the customer has a machine that doesn't have the EPP client installed and is bringing in a file from a machine that HAS a client installed, it makes sense that file copy logs are not appearing as client can't route exactly where the file copy was done. So what we see is an expected behaviour. It is possible that the usecase in which they saw ""File copy"" logs before was not exactly the same as this one.

Thank you for the update.
Will confirm with the customer if this is repeatable with the latest client version.
And confirm the exact steps they took to test this.","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2025-02-12T11:29:11.000Z","2025-02-12T11:29:11.000Z","false","false"
