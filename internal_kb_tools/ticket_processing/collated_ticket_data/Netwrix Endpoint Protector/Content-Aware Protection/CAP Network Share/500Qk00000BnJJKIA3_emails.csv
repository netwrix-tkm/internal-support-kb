Thank you for contacting us.
Unfortunately that exact use case is not possible.
Indeed, the Network Share exit point in CAP will apply to file transfers TO and FROM network shares (not just FROM).
If it helps you can create network share allowlists for certain file paths, but this will also apply TO and FROM network shares.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
So, just to be clear, it is impossible to allow file transfer into file share, and block file transfer out from file share at the same time?

That is right. The closest feature is the File Location Denylist which you mentioned it was tested.
The other way around (allow file reads and block file writes) it is possible if you configure Network share devices with 'Read Only' access from Device Control module.
