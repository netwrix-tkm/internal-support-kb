Client has alerted to the fact that some uploads have not been blocked. On reviewing the console and logs, it appears that logging of Content awareness stopped on 31/10. There is an alert about license expiry. 
Our usual tech who looks after these matters, Florian, is on leave.
I wanted to get some assistance in what is required to get the feature operating again.
Thanks,
Geoff","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-10T21:46:23.000Z"
