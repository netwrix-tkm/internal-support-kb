In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
  *   Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
  *   The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
  *   Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>.

I have forwarded the installer to the customer and they have installed it on 2 machines. They are observing the behaviour since the issue is intermittent. Will update you pertaining to this EOD.

Hi Team, 

  

I have forwarded the installer to the customer and they have installed it on 2 machines. They are observing the behaviour since the issue is intermittent. Will update you pertaining to this EOD.

Hi Team,

I have forwarded the installer to the customer and they have installed it on 2 machines. They are observing the behaviour since the issue is intermittent. Will update you pertaining to this EOD.

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.3.0064"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.

Hi Sidharth,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.3.0064"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vY3VzdG9tX2FnZW50L0VwcDE2MDkyMDI0L0VQUENsaWVudF92Ni4yLjMuMDA2NC56aXA=&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=eGt3a0twVnpXemcvUWVYREgwWEtNbkFySXFwczAzRUxnVG5JazZDcUYrcz0=&h=f5e026a8a4e642259f78f8a5fb675022&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>

Hello Prasanth,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00425192. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00425192
Ticket Subject: Screenshot upload not blocking ||DIABOS-EPP||
Ticket Details: We have blocked screenshots and file uploads on whatsapp application.

Hi Sidharth,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.3.0064"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.

Also, the below points were observed.

The customer wants to allow screenshots on Teams desktop application, but it is blocked.

I have forwarded the installer to the customer and they have installed it on 2 machines. They are observing the behaviour since the issue is intermittent. Will update you pertaining to this EOD.

Hi Netwrix Team,

As discussed, I have created the logs from the said system and attached it in this email.

Also, the below points were observed.

1. We have tried with the same steps with the 6.2.004, it is not working
2. we installed 6.2.3.1010, it is also not working on this agent.
3. server time is showing predated time.

I am attaching few screenshots of the product issue.

The customer wants to block screenshots from being sent from whatsapp desktop application but it is not being blocked,
The customer wants to allow screenshots on Teams desktop application, but it is blocked.

Hi Netwrix Team, 

  

As discussed, I have created the logs from the said system and attached it in this email. 

  

Also, the below points were observed. 

  

1. We have tried with the same steps with the 6.2.004, it is not working 

2. we installed 6.2.3.1010, it is also not working on this agent. 

3. server time is showing predated time. 

  

I am attaching few screenshots of the product issue. 

  

The customer wants to block screenshots from being sent from whatsapp desktop application but it is not being blocked, 

The customer wants to allow screenshots on Teams desktop application, but it is blocked.

Hi Sidharth,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.3.0064"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip

Hi Netwrix Team, 

  

As discussed, I have created the logs from the said system and attached it in this email. 

  

Also, the below points were observed. 

  

1. We have tried with the same steps with the 6.2.004, it is not working 

2. we installed 6.2.3.1010, it is also not working on this agent. 

3. server time is showing predated time. 

  

I am attaching few screenshots of the product issue. 

  

The customer wants to block screenshots from being sent from whatsapp desktop application but it is not being blocked, 

The customer wants to allow screenshots on Teams desktop application, but it is blocked.

Hi Team, 

  

I have forwarded the installer to the customer and they have installed it on 2 machines. They are observing the behaviour since the issue is intermittent. Will update you pertaining to this EOD.

You gave the following update for this case ""00425192 – File uploads on WhatsApp application are blocked but copy pasting images via PrntScr or capturing screenshot via snippet tool is getting uploaded on the WhatsApp application.""

Can you please confirm that the issue persists with test build ""version 6.2.4.0032"" provided on the 26th November ? I have tested this scenario myself before forwarding the test build to you and found that the build resolves the issue. 

Did you see my email which I sent on the 26th November? Below is the email which I sent when we provided you with the test build.
