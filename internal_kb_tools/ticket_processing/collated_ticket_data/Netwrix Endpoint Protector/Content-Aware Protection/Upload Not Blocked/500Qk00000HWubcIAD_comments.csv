We are getting a lot of pressure on this case and the customer states that this is critical for them.

Feedback that we received from the account manager is: ""We have an ongoing upsell discussion and they're refusing to talk further with us until we solve this ticket""

@WaitingOnEngineer Hi Andre, we already had a similar issue, and in 5.9.4.1 will be a fix which probably solves this issue: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip

Also, the below points were observed.

I am attaching few screenshots of the product issue.

@WaitingOnEngineerÂ EPP Client v6.2.3.0064 fixes one of the issues: when media with sensitive data is copied from file explorer with right click + copy. This test build includes that fix, and also addresses an issue with Clipboard monitoring, namely that clipboard images were not OCR scanned. In the 'Policy Exit Points -> Clipboard' turn on the first switch (Clipboard).
