@WaitingOnEngineer I have just tested with a recent client build with DPI On (both stealthy and non stealthy) and DPI Off, having URL categories both on and off for virustotal (I have used the exact configuration as depicted by the customer). I have also tested on dlptest.endpointprotector.com and dlptest.com, for all the stated configurations I got the intended behavior, the PDF was always blocked when it should've been blocked.

Could you please try to test again with a mainline build which was built from 05-Nov-2024 on?
