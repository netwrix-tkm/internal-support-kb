I received the following feedback on the R&D investigation:
This issue is still under investigation. We have managed to reproduce on our end as well.
Could the client trigger the detection for anything else on Slack? Also has the test been performed with a newer client?

Could you please check with the customer?

Thank you for your feedback, will be waiting for the investigation results.
Customer was focused to only blocking this URL on Slack, we did not receive reports about other false negatives with it.
The EPP client is the latest one.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback on the R&D investigation:
This issue is still under investigation. We have managed to reproduce on our end as well.
Could the client trigger the detection for anything else on Slack? Also has the test been performed with a newer client?

Could you please check with the customer?

Hello,

It looks like this test build successfully blocked the links sent to the Slack.
But also this version has some kind of bug (which could be present in test builds) the last connection shown like ""Unknown"" and there is no notification Pop-up appear after the block.

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback, will be waiting for the investigation results.

Customer was focused to only blocking this URL on Slack, we did not receive reports about other false negatives with it.

The EPP client is the latest one.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback on the R&D investigation:
This issue is still under investigation. We have managed to reproduce on our end as well.
Could the client trigger the detection for anything else on Slack? Also has the test been performed with a newer client?

Could you please check with the customer?

Hello,
 

The URL is similar to this:  https://prnt.sc/q5IHOw6x-HAM
Custom Content Denylist screenshot in the attachments.
Blocking in the browser is working, but in the Slack does not work and the link goes through.

Hello,

It looks like this test build successfully blocked the links sent to the Slack.
But also this version has some kind of bug (which could be present in test builds) the last connection shown like ""Unknown"" and there is no notification Pop-up appear after the block.

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback, will be waiting for the investigation results.

Customer was focused to only blocking this URL on Slack, we did not receive reports about other false negatives with it.

The EPP client is the latest one.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback on the R&D investigation:
This issue is still under investigation. We have managed to reproduce on our end as well.
Could the client trigger the detection for anything else on Slack? Also has the test been performed with a newer client?

Could you please check with the customer?

Hello,
 

The URL is similar to this:  https://prnt.sc/q5IHOw6x-HAM
Custom Content Denylist screenshot in the attachments.
Blocking in the browser is working, but in the Slack does not work and the link goes through.
