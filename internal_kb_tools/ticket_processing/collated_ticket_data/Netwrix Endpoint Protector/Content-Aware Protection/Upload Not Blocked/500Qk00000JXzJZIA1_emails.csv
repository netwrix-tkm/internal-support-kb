Hi Alin,

do you have any news for us.
The current state is really frustrating as we cannot assure that sensitive files are blocked via Teams. Sometimes it is working correctly, sometimes not. With a DLP solution this should work reliable.

Please give me an update on this. Thank you!

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I will perform a follow-up on this topicÂ and will get back to you once I receive any information.
Can you please confirm that you've restarted the MS Teams app after the CAP policy was set up and saved?

Hi Alin,

Â 

do you have any news for us.

The current state is really frustrating as we cannot assure that sensitive files are blocked via Teams. Sometimes it is working correctly, sometimes not. With a DLP solution this should work reliable.

Â 

Please give me an update on this. Thank you!

Best regards,

Hi Alin,

do you have any news for us.
The current state is really frustrating as we cannot assure that sensitive files are blocked via Teams. Sometimes it is working correctly, sometimes not. With a DLP solution this should work reliable.

Please give me an update on this. Thank you!
