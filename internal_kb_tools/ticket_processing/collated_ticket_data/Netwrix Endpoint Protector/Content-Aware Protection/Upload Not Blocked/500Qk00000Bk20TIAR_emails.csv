Hi Alin,

Thanks for your time today on call.

After you left the call we tested some other images for OCR, and it was successfully blocked.
Now, the only issue we need to look at is Keyword blocking on teams.

Please give me one-time slot to first check those use cases in our lab then get back to the customer.
