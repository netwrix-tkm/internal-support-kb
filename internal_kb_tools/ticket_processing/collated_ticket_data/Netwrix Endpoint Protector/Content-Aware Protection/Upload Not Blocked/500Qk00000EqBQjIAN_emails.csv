Hello Denis, 

The issue will be addressed in the 5.9.5.0 server version.
I asked if this fix could be included in the 5.9.4.1 server update and I am still waiting for the confirmation if this can be done.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

 

This was tested on Andrei’s Mac which has the following EPP version installed: 3.0.3.1 

The OS version is:  macOS 14.6;Darwin

 

I have attached some logs that we have collected from Andrei’s computer today after we have replicated the issue multiple times.

 

Kind regards,

Denis

Hello Denis,

I checked this internally and it was confirmed that there were some improvements made for Skype in the 5.9.4.0 server update.

Is the issue still occurring on the computers where the EPP Client was updated to the latest version?

Can we schedule a meeting in order to collect a new set of logs in order to investigate this further?

Thank you,
Emil
