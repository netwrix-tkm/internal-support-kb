Configured CAD file and PDF files attachment blocking policy for our windows users. It is getting blocked on Web URL's only. and it is not blocking while attaching into the mail clients.
If any files have the drawing data inside the file. It should block. but this is also not working for us as we expected.


 
Regards,
Prasanth","","","","The CAP policy was not blocking the user to add attachments to email, but he stopped him from sending it due to the file extensions.","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Satcom Infotech","Prasanth Ganesan","2024-06-10T10:43:22.000Z","2024-06-11T07:53:50.000Z"
