UPDATE 

Connected remote with the client to take a look at the issue.
The way he adjusted the CAP policy was to prevent files larger than .01 KB to be uploaded but it was not working.
Turns out that he also had the option ''Apply Policy if File Size Threshold is Matched'' enabled which made the CAP policy to work only if both conditions were matched.

Disabled the option and tried again and it was working as expected.
Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-22T12:42:13.000Z"
