We have noticed that uploads of sensitive files are not being blocked when using the exit points of WhatsApp Web, Telegram Web, Facebook Messenger Web. The files are being blocked when sending them through Slack so it is not an issue with the files themselves. The policies have the exit points activated for the applications mentioned and also for the browser. As the upload was done through the browser we were expecting to have them blocked regardless if the exit points for the messaging apps are activated or not.

In the past we were blocked when sending data to WhatsApp web but at the moment the upload is being allowed. The only thing generated in the logs is the DPI Bypass log. However, in PROD, we only get the DPI ByPass logged for Telegram, not for the others. This behavior has been replicated on both a Windows and Mac machine.

Please investigate this matter with urgency and let us know if you are able to replicate the issue on your systems.

If additional information is required, please let me know.

Kind regards,
Denis","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-06T09:13:28.000Z"
