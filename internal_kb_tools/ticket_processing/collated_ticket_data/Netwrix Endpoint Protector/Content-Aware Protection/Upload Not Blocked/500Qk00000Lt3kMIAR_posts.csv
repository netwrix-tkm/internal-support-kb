Customer name is RubyPlay.
They've observed the behavior when Lightshot's screenshot URL is not blocking when sending to the Slack by instant messaging.
Example of the URL: <a href='https://prnt.sc/YsO3xGTe2ID9' target='_blank'>https://prnt.sc/YsO3xGTe2ID9</a>
We have added next items into the Denylist:
<a href='//prnt.sc/' target='_blank'>//prnt.sc/</a>
<a href='https://prnt.sc/' target='_blank'>https://prnt.sc/</a>
<a href='prnt.sc' target='_blank'>prnt.sc</a>
—Åonfidential
These URLs successfully blocking if transferred to <a href='https://DLPTest.com' target='_blank'>DLPTest.com</a>, but if thy to send it to Slack it goes through.
We recreated the scenario in our environment, so you should be able too.
I will attach logs and screenshots.
Please look into this behavior, if you have any clarification question, please let us know.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-14T12:00:08.000Z"
