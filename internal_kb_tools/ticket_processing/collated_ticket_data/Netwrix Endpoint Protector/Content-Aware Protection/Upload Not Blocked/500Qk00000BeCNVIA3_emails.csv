Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have checked the CAP policy and is working correctly. 
Also,  we have enabled another CAP with the Report Only action, to monitor all the other files that are sent. 

Since the issue is solved, I will proceed with the closure of this case.

Should you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Have a nice day ahead!
