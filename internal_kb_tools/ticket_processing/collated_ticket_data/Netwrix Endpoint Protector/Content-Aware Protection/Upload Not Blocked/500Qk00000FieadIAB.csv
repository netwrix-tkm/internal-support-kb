"500Qk00000FieadIAB","00420952","Support Ticket","EPP client does not apply DPI certificate to the browser after install/update","Hello,

Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported about an issue that CAP policy does not block file transfer to the browser on Ubuntu 22 PC.
After additional investigation, we figured out that there was no active EPP DPI cert in the browser, then we restarted the browser and the valid certificate appeared, and file transfer was blocked successfully,
We are familiar that after install or updating the EPP client, Computer should be reloaded to proper client work.
But in the customer environment, there are many users who have not been rebooted their Computers for a very long period of time, as a browser either.
That is why force PC reboot is not always possible to do.
So, we wanted to ask you to help us find a solution to manage this situation.
Do you know some possible practice to force upload DPI certificate to the browser on Ubuntu PC, without restart PC or browser? Maybe some console command?
Or perhaps you have some other best practices?
Please share it with us.","","","","Partner:

""Hello,
I think we can close this ticket.
We have the confirmation that in some cases, browser restart is required for proper EPP client work.
Thank you.""","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","NONE","","32.1","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-13T10:18:34.000Z","2024-10-15T12:05:04.000Z"
