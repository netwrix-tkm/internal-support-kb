It looks like the user hasn't enabled the Network Extension. They can do this either manually by clicking ""Allow"" on the ""allow network extension"" prompt or through a deployment or Mobile Device Management software (such as JAMF, for example)

Also, while we expect to report the Gmail email sender at all times, the email receiver will not be available for attachments and when editing a draft that doesn't have a recipient. FYI: @WaitingOnEngineer

The Customer updated the EPP Client to the latest version and the EPP Client is not reporting the e-mail sender and receiver in the CAP logs.
The webmail monitoring is enabled, the configuration on the policies is correct, the files which are being sent are reported, but the logs are not containing the e-mail sender and receiver.
I attached a new set of logs https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00427058

Let me know if you can find something in the logs related to this issue.

This is not an issue. The customer attached a confidential file that was blocked.

As I've said in my comment earlier in this thread, the sender and recipients are not supposed to be sent for attachments and when
 editing a draft that doesn't have a recipient.

They will appear though when the customer adds confidential information in the email body or subject.

Also the customer did not upgrade to the latest version, but to 5.9.4.0.
