Hi Andrei,

Thanks for the quick response. We have a few more questions about the subject. The end to end encryption makes sense but why were we able to trigger alerts on WhatsApp Web in the past/last year? Based on what we can find online, WhatsApp mentions that they have end to end encryption since 2016.

Additionally, we seem to trigger alerts for WhatsApp that show up as crashlogs. We had a case last year about this issue and the problem seems to have resurfaced.

What is the reasoning behind having the exit points available if the end to end encryption makes tracking the upload of files pointless?

Would you please be able to provide a list of the applications that use end to end encryption that are available through the exit points?

Are there any other alternatives on tracking the upload of the files other than blacklisting the websites themselves?

Kind regards,
Denis

In the case of WhatsApp, the web app is encrypted at login, and any files uploaded are already encrypted before uploading there. On the Desktop app, attachments are only encrypted after they are attached so they can be inspected by our local proxy. 
If you saw logs from WhatsApp they could either be from the desktop app or from a computer that does not have DPI enabled. Also, false-positive logs could show up in the reports section, usually at login.
They are present as exit points for the desktop apps, not the web app, those are covered by the browser exit points.
As an alternative, using the WhatsApp desktop app instead of the web one would help in tracking uploads to the app.
As for a list of apps in the same situation as WhatsApp, unfortunately, we do not have one, but it is safe to say that most browser chat apps have end-to-end encryption.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
