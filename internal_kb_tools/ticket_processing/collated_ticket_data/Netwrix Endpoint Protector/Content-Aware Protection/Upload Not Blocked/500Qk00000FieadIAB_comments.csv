@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hello,

There are multiple issues here. But probably the main issue here is the browser.

During an EPP client update the DPI proxy process is not active and a running browser can establishes connection that are not monitored by EPP. This may also be a function of the routing of the packages. If those connection remain active then traffic might bypass DPI, once EPP is started.


In order for the EPP DPI certificate to be recognized by the browser it needs to be inserted into the browsers certificate store. If the browser is running and is not reloading the certificate store when it's modified by EPP then the EPP certificate will not be loaded.


That is why we consider that a browser restart is necessary.


Also, we would recommend a reboot from time to time, not only for EPP but also for all the updates to the system to be applied, like kernel and other packages patches.

Thank you for the feedback.  Our partner will relay this information to the customer.

They also sent us this

""Meanwhile, please clarify with dev team, if it is possible to manually force this process instead of reboot browser? Maybe customer can do some actions to implement the changes after EPP client was installedupdated?
Perhaps some CLI command to re-read Chrome browser certificates or update the traffic flow, so the EPP client DPI start to work properly?""

Could you please advise?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-01T08:27:25.000Z","2024-10-01T08:27:25.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer 
We don't know of any way to do this without a browser restart.

Both Chromium(Google Chrome) and Firefox have options to Restore tabs at startup, but they are off by default, so force stopping browsers isn't a viable option either.
