During the POC, We installed the EPP client on Ubuntu 22.04 machine successfully.

Configured Reports only policy to monitor the file upload activities. File uploaded but reports are not generated. 
So, again changed the Policy action as Block & Report. File upload is not blocked even report is also not generated.

Providing the Screenshot here. Please refer them and resolve the reported issues asap.

Regards,
Prasanth","","","","Hi Andre,
