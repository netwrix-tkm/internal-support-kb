Hi Harsh,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier today.

Today on our call we saw that the SSL certificate of Endpoint Protector does not get imported into your web browsers and as a result Endpoint Protector is not able to allow the whitelisted domains, so this results in the Content Aware Protection policy not working as expected.  Despite Deep Packet Inspection and Stealthy DPI Driver being enabled the EPP SSL Certificate does not get imported into your web browsers, the SSL certificate for peoplestrong remains present in all three web browsers (Chrome, Edge and Firefox).  You also stated that you are not using a proxy server.

Since you are using an older version of our product (Endpoint Protector Server v5.9.1.0 with Endpoint Protector client v6.1.0.600) on our call we recommended to you, to upgrade your Endpoint Protector Server version from 5.9.1.0 to version 5.9.4.0 and the Endpoint Protector Client from version 6.1.0.600 to version 6.2.3.1010 and after the upgrade is completed to retest the scenario and see if the issue persists.

If the issue persists with the latest versions of Endpoint Protector then we will need to collect logs and escalate the case to our R&D team who will review the logs and investigate the matter further.


IMPORTANT:
We strongly recommend that you perform a snapshot of the current state of the EPP appliance BEFORE applying any live updates.  In this way you will have a double safety measure and a quick way to revert back to the previous state in case anything goes wrong during the upgrade process.



Kind regards
