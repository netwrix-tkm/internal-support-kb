@WaitingOnEngineer Hi Ramon, according to the recording, the client is trying to upload files, which are already present on OneDrive server. Even if he deletes it, according to our experience, it could happen that OneDrive keeps them somewhere in a cache, and even if we block them, it restores from there. In the logs we report that they are blocked, therefore we must be sure that we really upload them. Can you repeat the test, with new files, which were never uploaded before to OneDrive? If we do not block them it would be helpful to have the logs. Please try to upload a single file at a given time, because the repeated upload tries generate too much noise.

@WaitingOnEngineer Hi Ramon, I have watched the second recording too. As I see the client tried to upload a sample file from https://dlptest.endpointprotector.com. I have created a blocking policy with e-mail address as sensitive data, downloaded the sample file Name_DOB_Email.pdf and tried to upload to OneDrive from browser. I get a notification that is blocked, but it was uploaded. I renamed it, and it was uploaded again. However, if I try to upload a pdf created by me (exported from Microsoft Office) it is not uploaded. Please try to upload brand-new files with custom data to see if those files are uploaded or not.

@WaitingOnEngineer 
We watched the video and analyzed the logs:

1. In our previous comment we requested not to upload already uploaded files to OneDrive. It could happen that OneDrive, similar to us, identifies files by its hash value, which does not change if you just rename it. Fortunately in the present case it did not cause any problem, but if an already uploaded file gets ""uploaded"" again after renaming it, we can not be sure if an actual upload happened, or the file was found in cache by its hash value. Next time a file gets uploaded instead of being blocked, and you want to try again, please change at least one character in it.

2. Unfortunately only the logs belong to the current session, the attached 'archive logs.zip' contains data from a previous session, not the current one. Therefore we relied only on the logs and the recording.

3. The client may not be aware, but from the 4 policies they show, only 2 arrives to the computer they are working on: ""Block File Share Sites"" and ""Block File Share Sites (Explicit)"". As we can see on the recording, these two policies initially do not have set OneDrive as exit point, therefore it is normal, that the first upload is succesfull. Later, after adding the OneDrive exit point to the policy ""Block File Share Sites"" the file is blocked (even if it was just renamed), so epp-client behaves as expected. (The uploaded file is identified as application/xml. This might be a bug. If it can be reproduced please report it and provide the sample file)

Please ask the customer to retest, if possible using only a single policy, with properly set exit points.
