Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that file upload block to Web MS Teams works unstable.
The issue was discovered by customer when they realized that Instant messages in web MS Teams were not blocking.
Then they started to test it and figured out that some files transfer also are not blocking to Teams, at the same it these files were successfully blocked to DPL-test website.
So, the same files were blocked in DLP-test and were not blocked in MS Teams.
NOTE: At the same time, NOT all files are NOT blocking to Teams, some files still blocking there, which means that CAP policy actually works.
So, this behavior is strange, customer made a video and screenshot+logs.
I will attach it under the ticket.
If you need additional information, please let me know.","","","","The test build addressed the issue - the fix will be included in 5.9.4.1","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","","","127.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-04T12:29:10.000Z","2025-01-09T12:04:01.000Z"
