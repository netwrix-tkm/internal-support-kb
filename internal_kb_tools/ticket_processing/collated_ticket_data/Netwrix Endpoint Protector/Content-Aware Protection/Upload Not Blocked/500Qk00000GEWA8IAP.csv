We are facing the below issues on the EPP POC. Also need a clarification on above listed queries:

Issues:

1. File upload is not blocked on the Web mails. but file upload is getting blocked on <a href='https://dlptest.com' target='_blank'>dlptest.com</a> URL.
2. Initially CAP reports are generated but shadow copy is not coming. Almost waited for 15mins but shadowcopy is not coming with the reports.
3. After sometimes general CAP reports also not generated.

Queries:

1. Customer has MacOS 15 version, But in our console able to see the latest macos version 14 only to download the agent.  Please provide the agent file for MacOS15 or confirm can use same setup file for MacOS15 as well.

2. Customer using Gsuite webmail access. They wants to allow send the email to listed email domains only. If incase user is trying to send the email to <a href='https://gmail.com' target='_blank'>gmail.com</a> id or non listed domains, the mail sending should get block.

Please take this case on critical priority and resolve the reported issues and queries asap.

Regards,
Prasanth","","","","Had a session with the customer as seen below:
