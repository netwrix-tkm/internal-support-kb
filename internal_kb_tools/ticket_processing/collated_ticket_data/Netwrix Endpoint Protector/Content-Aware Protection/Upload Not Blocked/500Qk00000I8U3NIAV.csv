"500Qk00000I8U3NIAV","00426602","Support Ticket","Upload not blocked - licensing enquiry","Good morning,

Client has alerted to the fact that some uploads have not been blocked. On reviewing the console and logs, it appears that logging of Content awareness stopped on 31/10. There is an alert about license expiry. 
Our usual tech who looks after these matters, Florian, is on leave.
I wanted to get some assistance in what is required to get the feature operating again.
Thanks,
Geoff","","","","Forwarded to sales.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","NONE","","10.3","Closed - Resolved","MSP Blueshift","Geoff Gillard","2024-11-10T21:46:22.000Z","2024-11-21T05:12:41.000Z"
