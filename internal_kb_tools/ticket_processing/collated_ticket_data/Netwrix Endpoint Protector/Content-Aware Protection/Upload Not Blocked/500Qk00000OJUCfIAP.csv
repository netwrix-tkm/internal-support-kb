"500Qk00000OJUCfIAP","00442728","Support Ticket","File uploading not getting blocked on Web","i am able to upload file on web , it should be blocked as per our policy.","","Client added a CAP policy in place but it doesn't work as he's still able to upload content through Web browsers.

UPDATE 

Connected remote with the client to take a look at the issue.
The way he adjusted the CAP policy was to prevent files larger than .01 KB to be uploaded but it was not working.
Turns out that he also had the option ''Apply Policy if File Size Threshold is Matched'' enabled which made the CAP policy to work only if the threshold criteria was met as well, whereas he only wanted to block everything that exceeded that amount.

Disabled the option and tried again and it was working as expected.
Agreed to close the case.","Scheduled a remote session for investigation.

UPDATE
Closing ticket as resolved.","Issue solved after disabling Apply Policy if File Size Threshold is Matched within the CAP policy.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","NONE","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","Bright Life Care Limited","Vikas Kataria","2025-04-22T09:39:34.000Z","2025-04-22T12:45:20.000Z"
