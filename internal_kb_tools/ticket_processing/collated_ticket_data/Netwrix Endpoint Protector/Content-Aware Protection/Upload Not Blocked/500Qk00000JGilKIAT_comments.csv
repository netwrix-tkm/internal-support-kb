I don’t know exactly how the customer uses the product (with DPI/ without DPI) and why after disabling the mentioned CAP policy everything starts to work, but i am pretty confident it is related to “Palo Alto” VPN which tunnel the entire traffic before the epp manage to scan anything.

If you will open the eppsslsplit.log you will observe this is empty, ONLY the same line, no connection received.

Probably when it works as expected our network extension (after a restart was installed firstly and we receive the entire traffic BEFORE palo alto).

We know about this subject, sensible subject related to network extensions AND I don’t KNOW how you can deliver this topic to the customer, but the issue seems to be related to Palo Alto, NOT to our MIP detection.

I asked the customer if he could remove the Global Protect VPN in order to check if the described behavior will reproduce, unfortunately they can not install Global Protect VPN, not even from the test machines.
They told me that the EPP Client stopped working on the user's machine after a MacOS update. They tried disconnecting from the VPN without any change in behaviour. Also tried multiple policy updates with no changes in the client behavior.
The EPP Client started to work again after a restart.
Let me know if the new details would help in any way.","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2024-12-16T13:22:28.000Z","2024-12-16T13:22:28.000Z","false","false"

This seems to be a problem of priority of network extensions and probably happened ONLY after MacOS upgrade (as you mentioned).

In the past we improved our code to be sure our network extension will be installed faster than other network extension, immediately after the user will be logged in. (no guarantee for this action to be first with network extension installation, this is a problem by design, by Apple)

We had a lot of customers with Global Protect VPN installed and NO other cases were reported. (this means either our network extension was installed first and works as expected OR the vpn has other configurations and they changed something recently)

We recommend after MacOS upgrade to restart the computer.

Please collect logs with the latest agent if the problem can be replicated also after computer restart.

This is happening on multiple computers?
