@WaitingOnEngineer

Please collect epp DPI extended logs and ask the customer the followings:

	 - 	what vpn is used?
	 - 	what proxy is used?
	 - 	what other DPI third party solution is used?


This scenario is happening when multiple VPNs/proxies are used and other third party app intercepts the traffic before epp client.
