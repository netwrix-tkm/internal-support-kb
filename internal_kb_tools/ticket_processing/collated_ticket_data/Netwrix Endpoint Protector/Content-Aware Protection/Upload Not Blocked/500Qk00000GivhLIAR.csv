"500Qk00000GivhLIAR","00423099","Support Ticket","Content Allow only peoplestrong.com domain","Hi Team,

We need to update our DLP policies to restrict data uploads to all external domains, except for the domain <a href='https://peoplestrong.com' target='_blank'>peoplestrong.com</a>. Please ensure that the <a href='https://peoplestrong.com' target='_blank'>peoplestrong.com</a> domain is whitelisted so that users can upload data only to this domain, while all other domains are blocked. This update is required on priority.
Allow: Uploads to the domain <a href='https://peoplestrong.com' target='_blank'>peoplestrong.com</a>.
Block: All other domains for data uploads.

Regards,
