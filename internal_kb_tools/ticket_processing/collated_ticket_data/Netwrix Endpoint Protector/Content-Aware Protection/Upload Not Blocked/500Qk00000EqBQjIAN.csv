"500Qk00000EqBQjIAN","00418963","Support Ticket","Skype not being blocked by EPP","Hello,

Skype is currently active in our CAP policies as an exit point however document uploads are not being blocked at all. The desktop version of Skype was used in testing on the latest Mac EPP release version. Our server version is also 5.9.4.0. This is an old issue that we were waiting a fix on, and back in April you have mentioned that it will be addressed in the 5.9.4.0 release. We confirm that the issue is still present at this time. Could you please have a look at this as we have quite a lot of users using Skype unmonitored at the moment. 

Thank you.","","EPP is not blocking skype correclty.","The issue is addressed in 5.9.4.1","The new process name for Skype was added in the 5941 server version.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Upload Not Blocked","","","180.6","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Denis Pasca","2024-08-23T06:49:49.000Z","2025-02-19T20:32:15.000Z"
