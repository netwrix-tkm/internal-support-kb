We had an issue today with EPP not blocking uploads for Mac users. This has not affected all the Mac users, but they were all using the same OS version Sequoia 15.1.1 . We had the MiP integration activated for Windows&Mac users for the alpha group policies with no issues. Today we have also added the production groups to the MiP policies and then when we tried to test if the labeling is blocked we noticed that Mac users were not blocked no matter what they were trying to send, labeled or not.

We had a session with Emil and we sent some logs from one of the affected users. After disabling the MiP policy and after the user restarted their laptop, EPP started to block them, but we are unsure if the two are related.

Please treat this with the highest priority, as this is not the first instance in which Mac users are not being blocked and the problem is pending for a few months already.

Kind regards,
Denis","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-09T15:42:42.000Z"
