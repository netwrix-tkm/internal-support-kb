This issue is still under investigation. I have managed to reproduce on my end as well.
Could the client trigger the detection for anything else on Slack? Also has the test been performed with a newer client?

This is the following feedback I received from the customer:
Customer was focused to only blocking this URL on Slack, we did not receive reports about other false negatives with it.
The EPP client is the latest one.

The issue here was the way Slack classifies URLs with http or https with URL tag and not text as for the simple URLs (without http/https mark). The problem has been fixed by searching for the ""url"" tag if the ""text"" tag is missing from the request.
A test build containing this fix can be found here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_04_01EppClient_v6.2.4.0115
@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan Could you please help with the download link?

Please find below the feedback from the customer regarding the test build:
It looks like this test build successfully blocked the links sent to the Slack.
But also this version has some kind of bug (which could be present in test builds) the last connection shown like ""Unknown"" and there is no notification Pop-up appear after the block.

The customer sent over a new set of logs for this build, I uploaded them to the ticket (slack logs.zip).

Thanks,

Hello,
Thank you for the feedback. Regarding the newly discovered bug, it was a problem with the signature of the test build. This has been fixed and it will not be present further.

@WaitingOnEngineer
Thanks for confirming test build fix. Test build according the signing certificate will not rebuild. Purpose of test build is not to be use massively on production. Certificate validity issue is addressed in oncoming 5943 Clients, which are dedicated as production one.
