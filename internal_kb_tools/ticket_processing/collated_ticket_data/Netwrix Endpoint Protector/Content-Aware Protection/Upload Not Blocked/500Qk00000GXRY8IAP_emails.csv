Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[cid:image008.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot.

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[cid:image008.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.




Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call.

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help.

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

[cid:image010.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.




Best Regards,

You don't often get email from techsupport@netwrix.com. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>



Hello Naveen,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Can we ask you to ensure that the following settings are enabled please?:

1. Deep Packet Inspection for the Microsoft Teams application for Windows.  You will find this setting under ""Content Aware Protection"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection Applications"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[cid:image011.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

2. Extended Source Code Detection.  You will find this setting under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"" > ""Extended Source Code Detection"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[cid:image012.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]


3. File Tracing and File Hash. You will find these settings under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"" > ""File Tracing and Shadowing"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[cid:image013.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]



If the above settings are already enabled and EPP still fails to intercept content uploaded via Microsoft Teams then please uninstall the official EPP client v6.2.3.1, make sure to select ""Remove database and logs"" when running the uninstallation wizard.  Restart the machine when the uninstallation is complete then proceed to download the EPP Test Build v6.2.3.0064, install it and then retest the scenario.


[cid:image014.png@01DB2F84.57100DA0]

If the EPP test build v6.2.3.0064 does not resolve the issue then please uninstall this version, again please make sure to select ""Remove database and logs"" each time when running the uninstallation wizard.  Restart the machine when the uninstallation is complete then proceed to download the EPP Test Build v6.2.3.0070, install it and then retest the scenario.

Please download the EPP Client Test Builds using these download links:

 1.  EPP test build v6.2.3.0064  -  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0064.zip
 2.  EPP test build v6.2.3.0070  -  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0070.zip


Please keep in mind that this is only a test build and should only be installed on 1 - 3 affected machines for testing purposes.

Please let us know if the issue is resolved with either one of these builds.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

 

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

 

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

 

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[Inline image name : image008.png]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

 

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot. 

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[Inline image name : image008.png]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

 

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

 

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call. 

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help. 

 

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

 

[Inline image name : image010.png]

 

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

 

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Can we ask you to ensure that the following settings are enabled please?:

1. Deep Packet Inspection for the Microsoft Teams application for Windows.  You will find this setting under ""Content Aware Protection"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection Applications"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[Inline image name : image011.png]

2. Extended Source Code Detection.  You will find this setting under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"" > ""Extended Source Code Detection"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[Inline image name : image012.png]

3. File Tracing and File Hash. You will find these settings under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"" > ""File Tracing and Shadowing"".  Please see below screenshot for reference.

[Inline image name : image013.png]

If the above settings are already enabled and EPP still fails to intercept content uploaded via Microsoft Teams then please uninstall the official EPP client v6.2.3.1, make sure to select ""Remove database and logs"" when running the uninstallation wizard.  Restart the machine when the uninstallation is complete then proceed to download the EPP Test Build v6.2.3.0064, install it and then retest the scenario.

[Inline image name : image014.png]

If the EPP test build v6.2.3.0064 does not resolve the issue then please uninstall this version, again please make sure to select ""Remove database and logs"" each time when running the uninstallation wizard.  Restart the machine when the uninstallation is complete then proceed to download the EPP Test Build v6.2.3.0070, install it and then retest the scenario.

Please download the EPP Client Test Builds using these download links:

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.4.0031"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v.6.2.4.0031.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.

Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

 

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

 

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

 

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[Inline image name : image008.png]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

 

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot. 

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[Inline image name : image008.png]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

 

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

 

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call. 

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help. 

 

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

 

[Inline image name : image010.png]

 

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

 

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.

I wanted to follow up on this case as we have not yet received an update from you since we provided a test build on the 19th November.
Did you manage to install the test build and retest the scenario to see if the build resolves the issue?  Please do give us a status update on this.

Hi Naveen,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.4.0031"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v.6.2.4.0031.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.

Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

 

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

 

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

 

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[Inline image name : image008.png]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

 

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot. 

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[Inline image name : image008.png]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

 

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

 

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call. 

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help. 

 

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

 

[Inline image name : image010.png]

 

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

 

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.

Dear Daniel,

With this test build installed, I can achieve the policy (File uploads to MS Teams are getting blocked).

On Virustotal, it is not allowing me to upload any files. But at times we want to upload some files to be uploaded to check their reputation.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I wanted to follow up on this case as we have not yet received an update from you since we provided a test build on the 19th November.
Did you manage to install the test build and retest the scenario to see if the build resolves the issue?  Please do give us a status update on this.


Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.4.0031"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v.6.2.4.0031.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.




Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[cid:image008.png@01DB424F.188C9E80]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB424F.188C9E80]

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot.

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[cid:image008.png@01DB424F.188C9E80]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.




Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.




Best Regards,

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call.

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help.

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

[cid:image010.png@01DB424F.188C9E80]

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.

Dear Daniel,

With this test build installed, I can achieve the policy (File uploads to MS Teams are getting blocked).

On Virustotal, it is not allowing me to upload any files. But at times we want to upload some files to be uploaded to check their reputation.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I wanted to follow up on this case as we have not yet received an update from you since we provided a test build on the 19th November.
Did you manage to install the test build and retest the scenario to see if the build resolves the issue?  Please do give us a status update on this.

Hi Naveen,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.4.0031"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v.6.2.4.0031.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.




Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

Kindly check and revert.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #422679 - - Upload is not denied in MS Teams [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0GXRY8:ref ]

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[cid:image008.png@01DB4253.BD9048B0]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB4253.BD9048B0]

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

Thanks!

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #422679 - - Upload is not denied in MS Teams [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0GXRY8:ref ]

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot.

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[cid:image008.png@01DB4253.BD9048B0]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #422679 - - Upload is not denied in MS Teams [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0GXRY8:ref ]

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call.

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help.

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

[cid:image010.png@01DB4253.BD9048B0]

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.

Dear Daniel,

With this test build installed, I can achieve the policy (File uploads to MS Teams are getting blocked).

On Virustotal, it is not allowing me to upload any files. But at times we want to upload some files to be uploaded to check their reputation.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I wanted to follow up on this case as we have not yet received an update from you since we provided a test build on the 19th November.
Did you manage to install the test build and retest the scenario to see if the build resolves the issue?  Please do give us a status update on this.

Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

I would like to give you an update on this case.

Our R&D team have prepared a test build ""version 6.2.4.0031"", can you uninstall the current EPP Client from one of the affected machines and then install the test build, retest the scenario and let us know if the issue is resolved or persists please?

You can download the test build using this link:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v.6.2.4.0031.zip

Please note that test builds are not meant for deployment within production environment, the purpose of  test builds is to test and validate a fix.  Please only install the test build on 1 - 3 endpoint machines for testing purposes only.

Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for the update and feedback.  I will need to open an escalation with our Dev team.  Thank you for the detail in the PDF document.  I see you sent your email on Friday but I don't see the logs which you uploaded on Friday, only the ones from the 9th October are there.  Could you rename them to include the date and then uploaded them again please?

Hi Andre,

 

Please note that I followed as instructed, still not working as expected. I can still upload files to the site when the rights (Priority) are set to “Computer”, the entity set to “Computer” and DPI is enabled on both the “Computer” and the “User”.

Refer to the attached PDF for better clarification.

 

Also, I’ll upload the debug logs on the portal now.

 

Kindly check and revert.

Hi Naveen,

The entity which you selected for Content Aware Policy which you are enforcing was ""user"" but the DPI setting which you toggled ON and OFF when testing the policy was on the computer level.  The below rights functionality is set on ""Computer"", considering this there are mismatches as to how the policy will be enforced.

You had the DPI setting turned on on user level but this was not effective as the right functionality is currently set to ""Computer"", so the settings on the computer level took priority while the CAP policy was set on ""User""

[Inline image name : image008.png]

Considering the above, can I kindly ask you to only test on computer level please? So switch the DPI and Stealthy DPI driver on under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"".

Leave this setting turned on, on the computer level.  Make sure to select your computer under the CAP policy.  Update the policies on the EPP client, and then open the EPP client and make sure that the DPI shows ""Enabled""

After this, please enable the URL category again and re-test the scenario.  Uploads made to Virustotal and the domains listed in the URL category should be blocked while uploads to any other domain not listed in the URL catogary should not be blocked.

Could you please test it after making the changes advised above and let me know if EPP works as expected?

If you would like to look at this together in a a remote session then we can do so but I am out of office tomorrow and will be back next week Monday.  Could you test this in the meanwhile and see if it works as expected please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’ve uploaded the artifact once again, please check. See the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

However, to further test with any settings enabled or disabled, I request you to be on a call to test it as I see some inconsistencies (maybe my understanding is wrong) while testing.

 

Let me know your availability after you review the artifacts.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I remember in our previous remote session that your ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" was set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  For DPI, it will remain off even when the DPI is turned ""ON"" on the User level and ""OFF"" on the Computer level.  See below screenshot. 

DPI is reported to be ""OFF"" in the EPP client under the ""Troubleshooting"" tab, when the ""Endpoint Protector Rights Functionality"" is set to ""Use both"" and ""Computer Rights"".  This means the last test that we did towards the end of our call today, the DPI was in fact ""OFF"" and the CAP policy was enforced on all domains not just the URL category.  Now if you set the functionality rights to ""User Rights"" and update the policies then you will notice that the ""DPI"" will be enabled on the EPP client.

Here the DPI is turned on on the user level but off on computer level the same as you had the setting earlier for your machine.
[Inline image name : image008.png]

I just wanted to form you of the above.  In the meanwhile I will wait for the artifact, review the logs and test the scenario further as discussed earlier on our call and then get back to you with more details.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Thanks for connecting.

After testing with multiple scenarios, we noted that the upload to virustotal.com is blocked only when the DPI is disabled. We would like to understand how this DPI is expected to work and can be applied to the use cases.

 

Refer to the attachment for the detail containing the different scenarios tested.

 

Let us know your availability to engage on a call.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time on today's call. 

After we uninstalled the test build today and restarted your machine the installation of EPP Client 6.2.3.1010 was successful.

Regarding the upload not being intercepted on the domain: 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload' please re-test the scenario and then update the polices on the client and proceed to upload the logs to the EPP Server.  The artifact will be available to download after 20-30 minutes under ""Reports and Analysis"" > ""Logs Report"" > expand ""Filters"" > ""Event"" and select ""Artifact Received"".
I also tested the scenario internally by uploading content to this web domain and the file was only intercepted upon clicking on ""Upload"".  This seems to indicate that the transmission of the file only begins when clicking on  ""Upload"".  See short video recording of this being demonstrated.   I would recommend that we have a second remote session to look into this further and investigate.

You can download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip  You can also use this tool to collect epp client logs, please see attached guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine.pdf""

Can I ask ask that we keep all communication on this thread? All communication between Netwrix and the clients needs to be documented on the support tickets.

Can we schedule a follow up call tomorrow to investigate the issue with uploads to virustotal.com further?  I have a slot open for 1:30 PM IST tomorrow.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

Yes, as suggested I uninstalled (Remove database and logs) the latest version v6.2.3.1, restarted, and installed the test build v6.2.3.0064. But didn’t help. 

 

But the same is tested with the other user in the latest version agent by enabling the DPI from the global setting (which was not enabled earlier and not suggested by you as well) and now it is working, the upload is getting blocked. Now this is achieved, further, we will test and evaluate.

Now, I uninstalled the test build from my machine and manually installed the latest version downloaded from the portal. Unfortunately, the other problem is I don’t see the EPP installed at all and/or not pushed by the MDM, not listed under the control panel.

 

Please let me know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot this.
