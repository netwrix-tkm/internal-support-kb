Hello,


Thank you.

Seems like we managed to recreate the scenario if enable Restrict Content Detection option in CAP policy.

We are not sure that this option is 100% the reason because customer used it for a very long time, but we're just sharing with you our observation.

So, when we used the Restrict Content Detection the similar behavior repeated, and when we disabled it, the situation stared to be better and files were blocked.
Please try to recreate this in your environment.
