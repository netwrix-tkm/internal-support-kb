Hello Team,

Good Day !

We have created a policy for blocking files containing a specific passcode. Policy live and we are able to see block pop ups also, but files are reaching the destination.

Kindly help in getting this sorted.

We work on IST hours from 11 AM IST to 8:00 PM IST, but as this policy is urgent we can extend and we are available for the next 3 hours for a troubleshooting call.

Hello Team,

 

Good Day !

 

We have created a policy for blocking files containing a specific passcode. Policy live and we are able to see block pop ups also, but files are reaching the destination.
 

Kindly help in getting this sorted.

 

We work on IST hours from 11 AM IST to 8:00 PM IST, but as this policy is urgent we can extend and we are available for the next 3 hours for a troubleshooting call.

 

 

Thanks,

Zion Ravichandran

Hi Zion,

Can you give us some more details about this? What is the exit point that you are trying to block? Is the issue happening with any file type/file content, or just some specific ones?

Also, please let us know your time zone as we might need to schedule a remote session to further troubleshoot this.

Hi Zion,

Can you give us some more details about this? What is the exit point that you are trying to block? Is the issue happening with any file type/file content, or just some specific ones?

Also, please let us know your time zone as we might need to schedule a remote session to further troubleshoot this.

Hello Team,

 

Good Day !

 

We have created a policy for blocking files containing a specific passcode. Policy live and we are able to see block pop ups also, but files are reaching the destination.
 

Kindly help in getting this sorted.

 

We work on IST hours from 11 AM IST to 8:00 PM IST, but as this policy is urgent we can extend and we are available for the next 3 hours for a troubleshooting call.
