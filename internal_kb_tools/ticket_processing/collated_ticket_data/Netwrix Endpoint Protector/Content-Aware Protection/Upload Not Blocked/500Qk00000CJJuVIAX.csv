"500Qk00000CJJuVIAX","00413051","Support Ticket","PRT File not recognized","Hello,

we are having our policy set up to remediate the upload of cad files, including prt-files from Siemens NX. Somehow I am still able to upload such files without remediation, because the file does not get recognized as prt file. In the EPP logs you can see that the file gets recognized as ""unidentified"". I also created some logs via the support tool - so i hope you can find the issue relatively fast.

Thank you in advance!","","","","The fix will be found in the 5.9.4.1 server version and equivalent client version.
