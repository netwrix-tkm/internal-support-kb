Thank you for your time today.
I will attach below the commands that the user would need to run in the Terminal in order to disable(until a restart) IPv6:

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -p

After that please update the policy on the client side and check the URLs in a new incognito window on Chrome and Firefox, and please share the result with us.

Thank you for your email.
The engineer would recommend to Allow/Whitelist the mentioned URLs. Are the pages loading fine after that?
Apart from the Cisco Anyconnect Secure Mobility Client (that was the VPN if I remember correctly), are you using any other load balancer, security solution, or anything that could block those URLs? The same issue is present with the VPN turned On/Off?

Hey,

1- Can you please guide me to where to allow/ whitelist the mentioned URLs in the dashboard? I'll let you know after whitelisting if the pages are loading fine after that or not.
2- Apart from Cisco Anyconnect, no tools are installed on that system.
3- With the VPN turned off, he won't be able to access those URLs since they are meant to be accessed only by VPN.

Thanks.","Netwrix Support Ticket #411584 - Enduser facing issues on Linux","abhishek.tewari@successive.tech","Abhishek Tewari","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-07-15T11:56:06.000Z","true"

You can add the URLs under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection. Please use only the generic part of the URL and the wildcard symbol to have a better coverage, for example: *us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com*

After adding the URLs there, please make sure to also select them in the CAP policy that you assign the user to. For this you need to to go in the CAP policy > Policy Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection, tick the allowlist that you want and Save.

Make sure to update the policy on the client side before proceeding with the test.

Hello Alin,
I tested the steps mentioned above for whitelisting URLs, but the user can still not access those URLs. Can we schedule a meeting so that you can have a look at it, preferably tomorrow or on Friday at 4 PM IST?
