I don't see any issue in logs, and the mentioned URL's are not visible in eppsslsplit.logs, but it is visible in eppclient.log file. (it is a chance to not collect the proper logs)

Few questions:

	 - 	you tried to allowlist/whitelist the mentioned Urls?
	 - 	they uses any other product?
	 - 	which error is disaplayed when they try to access the mentioned URLs?

Hello,

After investigating the packet routing rules we've concluded that Cisco software is causing the issue.
As far as we can tell there is nothing we (EPP) can do about this.

We've had a previous case with Cisco AnyConnect VPN involving PrivatBank and they pinpointed the exact rules that were causing the problem, but Cisco was unwilling to make a workaround for this issue.
The problematic rules:

--- CODE ---
   36  2985 ACCEPT     all  --  *      lo+     0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0          
   36  2985 ACCEPT     all  --  lo+    *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0          
--- CODE ---

They would need to be changed to something like so:


--- CODE ---2        0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            127.0.0.0/8        

3        2   146 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       127.0.0.0/8          0.0.0.0/0  
--- CODE ---

How should we proceed with this issue? @Krzysztof Staszalek @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Please see the below feedback from Engineering team:
""
After investigating the packet routing rules we've concluded that Cisco software is causing the issue.
As far as we can tell there is nothing we (EPP) can do about this.

We've had a previous case with Cisco AnyConnect VPN involving PrivatBank and they pinpointed the exact rules that were causing the problem, but Cisco was unwilling to make a workaround for this issue.

They would need to be changed to something like so:

2        0     0 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            127.0.0.0/8        

3        2   146 ACCEPT     all  --  *      *       127.0.0.0/8          0.0.0.0/0  
--- CODE ---

After also discussing with Krzysztof, we highly recommend that the customer should update the routing on their side as this issue is on Cisco VPN Software.

I hope this helps.
Regards,
Cristi
