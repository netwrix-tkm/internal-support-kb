After the login on that pages the follow up isn't loaded or the page stays white. I did add both URL's  to the DPI Whitelist but that didn't change anything. After removing the EPP client from the workstation everything is working again","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-05T21:21:12.000Z"

In our remote session we discovered that the required DPI allowed list (which contains the allowed affected domain) was not added to the Content Aware Protection policy.
The user was able to access the required web page immediately after we have modified the Content Aware Protection policy and after updating the policies on the user's computer.  The issue is resolved. Customer confirmed that case can be closed.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-05-13T10:35:45.000Z"
