"500Qk00000Bh4JmIAJ","00411584","Support Ticket","Enduser facing issues on Linux","Hi Team,

One of our Linux started facing issues after we installed and applied policies to his system. He cannot access certain URLs after connecting to the client VPN when the policies are applied. As soon as I disable the policies for his system, the urls are accessible again. The URLs he provided are:

<a href='https://vpc-caap-dev-t5gvqgjksdsnydi6y25wfrqbny.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?' target='_blank'>https://vpc-caap-dev-t5gvqgjksdsnydi6y25wfrqbny.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?</a>

<a href='https://vpc-caap-stage-6xg4kdfp6wsiqg6yxpli7jdllq.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console' target='_blank'>https://vpc-caap-stage-6xg4kdfp6wsiqg6yxpli7jdllq.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console</a>

<a href='https://vpc-caap-qa-knbm52h7iizoqc62ii4yovreae.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/dev_tools#/console' target='_blank'>https://vpc-caap-qa-knbm52h7iizoqc62ii4yovreae.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/dev_tools#/console</a>

<a href='https://vpc-caap-prod-un5utxo55ja3b3jc2mjlphq45e.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console' target='_blank'>https://vpc-caap-prod-un5utxo55ja3b3jc2mjlphq45e.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_dashboards/app/login?nextUrl=%2F_dashboards%2Fapp%2Fdev_tools#/console</a>

I have already checked in the 'Report and analysis' section and it also doesn't show that the above-mentioned URLs are being blocked by the EPP.

Please look into this issue as for now we have disabled the policies for the end user.

Thanks","","","","issue is because of their VPN solution","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Website Access","","","99.9","Closed - Resolved","Successive Technologies Pvt Ltd","","2024-06-11T09:51:05.000Z","2024-09-19T07:58:25.000Z"
