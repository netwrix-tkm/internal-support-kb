Dear Netwrix Team,


Thanks for sharing your time on remote session yesterday.

We have found one loophole in policy that data is transferring by Bluetooth to mobile device while we have blocked Bluetooth in policy. Screenshot is attached for your reference.

Please check on an urgent basis.

You are welcome!
I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I was told to ask you to upgrade all the clients to the latest version, by creating upgrade jobs for them, as I showed you in the call we had yesterday.
After you upgraded, please test this again, and also test if WhatsApp is blocked successfully.

If the issue persists after the update, please let me know and we'll troubleshoot further.

Dear Netwrix Team,

 

 

Thanks for sharing your time on remote session yesterday.

 

We have found one loophole in policy that data is transferring by Bluetooth to mobile device while we have blocked Bluetooth in policy. Screenshot is attached for your reference.  

 

Please check on an urgent basis.

Hi Andrej,

WhatsApp is blocked after installation new software.

We are trying to upgrade our remote users but the upgrade policy is not updating the pcs.

I have also tried even a single pc but that could not upgrade. We have around 200 pc on remote location that are not possible to reinstall software manually.

So you are requested to please check once why the remote clients not upgrading.


Regards,
Vipin

If it still does not work, please try to update the Epp clients manually to test if WhatsApp is blocked successfully.

Hi Vipin,

You are welcome!
I apologise for the late reply, I was caught up in remote sessions all day.

I was told to ask you to upgrade all the clients to the latest version, by creating upgrade jobs for them, as I showed you in the call we had yesterday.
After you upgraded, please test this again, and also test if WhatsApp is blocked successfully.

If the issue persists after the update, please let me know and we'll troubleshoot further.

Dear Netwrix Team,

 

We have observed our policy not working properly and need to review the policy by your team.

 

Our Managment want to block all external mail included Gmail and allowed only whitelisted mail and domain names to secure company data.

 

So you are requested to please schedule a call for the same.

 

 

Regards,

Vipin
