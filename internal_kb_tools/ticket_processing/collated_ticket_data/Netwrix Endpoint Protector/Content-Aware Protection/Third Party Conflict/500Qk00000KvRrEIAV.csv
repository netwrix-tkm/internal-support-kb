Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported about issue when Cisco VPN connection drops due to EPP client.
Every browser page stopped loading for some reason, after PC reboot it works for 10-15 minutes and starts to fail loading pages again.
On screenshot you may see that firstly in Cisco Secure Client all checkmarks are green, but when the issue appears the ISE Posture starts to be gray and the Secure Endpoint module has a yellow mark.
When EPP client were terminated issue has gone.
