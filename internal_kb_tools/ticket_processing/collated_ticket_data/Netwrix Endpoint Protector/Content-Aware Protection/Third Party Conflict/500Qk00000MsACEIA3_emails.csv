Hi Andrei,

I am sorry I think I didn’t explain that one very well. Its not about the EPP client that can’t connect.
Its about a software called MobileX we are using in our company. And one of the users that is using that Software and has EPP installed can’t connect his MobileX client software with the server as long as EPP is installed.

Best regards
Benjamin

Hi Andrei,

Disabling DPI solves the problem.
Using the DPI settings from your screenshot same problem as before.

And Advanced Printer and MTP scanning is enabled.

Thank you for the information.
Can you try with all options selected under DPI Bypass?
If that still does not work, you can try to enable the Use Stealth DPI driver.

If that does not work please collect a set of logs following the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access the app.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

With all DPI options enabled it still didn’t work.
With Stealth DPI it’s working again.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you try with all options selected under DPI Bypass?
If that still does not work, you can try to enable the Use Stealth DPI driver.

If that does not work please collect a set of logs following the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access the app.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Thank you for the confirmation.
Not sure what is different for this computer.

Then, we can try different bypass options.
Can you please enable the below options for bypass and check again if the issue remains?
Bypass Unknown TLS Handshakes
Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requiremen

What I want to add.
We have tested it on several computers with EPP client and DPI enabled.
There the software starts without a problem. So far only that one particular client is having a problem despite all have the settings.

Hello,

Thank you for the clarification.
To test this you can try to turn off the DPI option for this computer from ""Device Control > Computers > Manage settings(on the affected computer).
Update the policy on the Epp client and restart the MobileX client software to see if it is connecting ok.
If it does please try to setup the DPI like this:

Hi Andrei,

I am sorry I think I didn’t explain that one very well. Its not about the EPP client that can’t connect.
Its about a software called MobileX we are using in our company. And one of the users that is using that Software and has EPP installed can’t connect his MobileX client software with the server as long as EPP is installed.

Best regards
Benjamin

Hi Andrei,

I am not sure if I can answer that. I don’t know what effects the Stealth option has.
What happens if in a few months the next user has the same problem. Should I just enable the same option then ?
Or should I enable Stealth as Global Setting ?

Hello,

Thank you for the confirmation.
Not sure what is different for this computer.

Then, we can try different bypass options.
Can you please enable the below options for bypass and check again if the issue remains?
Bypass Unknown TLS Handshakes
Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requiremen

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

 

I am sorry I think I didn’t explain that one very well. Its not about the EPP client that can’t connect.

Its about a software called MobileX we are using in our company. And one of the users that is using that Software and has EPP installed can’t connect his MobileX client software with the server as long as EPP is installed.

Hi Andrei,

I am not sure if I can answer that. I don’t know what effects the Stealth option has.
What happens if in a few months the next user has the same problem. Should I just enable the same option then ?
Or should I enable Stealth as Global Setting ?

Thank you for the information.
Can you try with all options selected under DPI Bypass?
If that still does not work, you can try to enable the Use Stealth DPI driver.

If that does not work please collect a set of logs following the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:

2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.

There should be no disadvantage, this helps DPI avoid conflict with other apps.
It is by default off because it is not required in all cases.
