Can you please disable ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"" option for the computer and confirm if the issue remains.

If this resolves it and you need the ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"" option to be enabled we can add the CiscoVPN (Cisco Secure Client) processname to an exception.

If the issue remains, please take a screenshot of the DPI settings.

Kind regards
