Hello, @WaitingOnEngineer

This issue is reproducing on my side, but only in clipboard. When I try to copy the word ""șeker"", it won't be blocked. However, on a classic file upload test to dlptest.endpointprotector.com, the word is detected correctly. 

Could you please confirm that the problem is related to the clipboard also on the customer side? Please do some tests both with file uploads and with clipboard. 

If the case is as mentioned above, then we already have an issue created which is targeted for v5.9.5.0 (#345111).

Thank you!

Hi, @WaitingOnEngineer

I was working on a similar issue related to words with special characters (the one I mentioned initially) and I made some changes for that. I prepared a test build containing that fix, and if possible, it would be helpful to know if that also fixes this issue. 

The test build is located at: \192.168.14.5publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_01_10EppClient_v6.2.4.0051

Thank you!

Hello, @WaitingOnEngineer

Thank you for the feedback! Could you please provide the exact steps that are taken or a video for those cases when the word is still not detected (test 1.txt and test 2.txt)?

I want to make sure that I do the exact same steps so that I can reproduce it on my computer, too.

Thank you!

Customer returned with the following statement:

Previously, I only performed tests using TXT files. Additionally, I tested the same content using PDF, Word, and Excel files.

In TXT files, blocking only occurs when all letters are written in uppercase. However, in PDF, Word, and Excel files, it detected and blocked everything.

Hello @WaitingOnEngineer, 

The issue is also reproducing on my side as described in the latest comment: in text files, content is blocked only when all letters are capitals and in all other filetypes, content is blocked as expected. 

I assume this has something to do with the way text with special characters is extracted from the text files. This is still under investigation in order to find the exact cause and a possible solution for it. 

Thank you!

Hello @WaitingOnEngineer,

After doing some more investigations and tests, the reason why this is happening is because for those specific files where we don't block the word, we detect a different character encoding than in the other cases.

The character encoding detection uses a probabilistic method. So for text files specifically, other character encoding might be sometimes determined if the text is too short (as in this case where there is only one word in those files).

Generally, this should not happen when there is a larger text in the file. Please try to redo the tests, by adding more text in the text files, not solely the word that should be blocked. In such situation, the files should be blocked as expected, as the character encoding would be correctly determined.

Thank you!
