I checked off all the file types and set the risk score to 5 but, I am getting alerts when just one attachment is sent.  i assume it is triggering because the attachments are in the denylist. but I cant figure out any other way to create an alert like this.","","Threat Threshold does not interact with File Type in this way.  In fact in the log it will say that it is ignoring it.

Re-created policy. Use case - block Outlook emails containing 5 or more attachments.
Issue: triggers on 1 attachment","Informed customer threat threshold applies to PII and not file types. Waiting on customer.
