This is for André Le Roux.

As discussed recently, need to understand on few policies as per business
requirement. Some of them are below :

How to make policies based on data uploaded to specific applications
focusing on defined PII by us ?
How to design better by correlating Department>Groups>Policies as per the
Organization Team structure given by us ?
Check System Settings, understanding department usage, Restrictive or
Permissive
How can we enhance it's OCR detection based on defined PII structure by us ?
How can we maintain data security on Outlook, Google mail in terms of
detecting PIIs & and specific code ?
How can we apply any exclusion for specific user, without changing to other
users in policy group ?
How can we move user or remove user from current policy to different policy
?
Understanding Contextual detection
Understanding User remediation & Justification List
