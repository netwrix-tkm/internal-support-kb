"500Qk00000I9ONKIA3","00426640","Support Ticket","The word ""şeker"" cannot be detected","Hello team,

We are facing an interesting issue. A customer is in the POC stage. They supplies food items like cakes and sweets to companies. The food recipes need to be monitored. These recipes contain ""şeker"", which is translated as ""sugar"" in English. However, no matter what we do, we are unable to detect the word ""şeker.""

We have defined it as custom content and also regex, but it still isn't detecting it.

Here’s an interesting situation: The customer previously tried McAfee DLP, and in that product, the word ""şeker"" was also not detected.

Could you please quickly review and provide feedback?

Best Regards.","","The customer is facing an issue with the CAP policies.
