"500Qk00000FI88AIAT","00419918","Support Ticket","New Use Case for PII Detection","Hello,

We have a new use case where we need to block PII + Donor information from being emailed within the Outlook platform. How can we build this combination without it triggering just regular PII information for certain users?","","","","We created a policy and made a combination of 1 regex + 3-4 PII items. We set the Global Threshold to 5 so if 5 or more violations(items) occur then the policy will trigger a block. If 4 or less occur it will not be blocked.

We currently only set it up for attached upload files as per macOS we would need DPI + DPI certificate to be added in order to test this.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Custom Content (custom PII)","","","6.8","Closed - Resolved","University of Southern California (USC)","Chris Gomez","2024-09-03T22:33:13.000Z","2024-09-10T18:08:05.000Z"
