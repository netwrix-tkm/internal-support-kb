Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support.

Due to end to end encryption it is not possible for Endpoint Protector to enforce a Content Aware Protection policy on the web version of WhatsApp.  This is due to the fact that the files being uploaded to the web version of WhatsApp are encrypted the moment you make the upload.  A workaround would be to block the web.whatsapp domain under ""Deep Packet Inspection"" > ""Denylists"" and apply the Content Aware Policy on the WhatsApp Desktop Application as exit point to deny or allow certain file types.  See the attached short video recording demonstrating on how to implement the suggested workaround.

For Google Drive you can create and enforce a Content Aware Protection Policy, you will need to select the web browsers as exit points within the CAP policy.  Please see the short video recording attached demonstrating on how to implement such a policy.

I hope this information is helpful, please do let us know if you have follow up questions.



Kind regards
