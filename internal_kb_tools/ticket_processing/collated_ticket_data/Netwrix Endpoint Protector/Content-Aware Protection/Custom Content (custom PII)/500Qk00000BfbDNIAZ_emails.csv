We would like to allow the emails. We have the policies set up so if the email is being sent internally (to another user with an @omimanagement.com email address) it should be whitelisted. We are not attempting to whitelist individual email addresses.

Currently the user is able to email me this document (I have an @omimanagement.com email address), but not other people within our organization.

I have our company domain whitelisted on the allow list, however this is being blocked. I have a feeling this has to do with the ""Exchange"" destination rather than just showing the email address as the destination (as shown in the example below) Can someone please help me troubleshoot?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.
Please clarify what you want to achieve. Do you want to allow the emails ?
If so, since you are using Microsoft Exchange email server, please note the exchange domain list needs to be whitelisted (Exchange Administrative Group) in the email domain whitelist from epp server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists.
In this scenario with Exchange domains, you can only whitelist the whole domain, and NOT individual email addresses like user@domain.com.
You will have to include/ check the email domain whitelist inside a content aware policy which targets the client machines, in order to take effect.
This whitelist feature requires ""Deep Packet Inspection"" setting to be enabled from Device Control > Global settings page.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Alin - I appreciate the detail, however I followed the instructions exactly and we are still experiencing the same issue. A sharescreen session would be helpful to fix this issue, as it is setting off multiple false positives within our organization.

Hi George,

Please try to create an email domain allowlist from server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists - Email domain, and add 'Exchange Administrative Group' value as can be seen here :
[cid:image001.png@01DAC3EA.B857DB20]

Then make sure you include/ check this allowlist inside a content aware policy which targets your machine, in order to take affect.
For example, under policy allowlists section :
[cid:image002.png@01DAC3EA.B857DB20]



Save all changes in server UI and then manually refresh policies from the client machine side.
Then you should be able to send emails to the @omimanagement.com domain.
Let us know the results. Afterwards if any issue persists we can schedule a remote session using Zoom.


Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

We would like to allow the emails. We have the policies set up so if the email is being sent internally (to another user with an @omimanagement.com email address) it should be whitelisted. We are not attempting to whitelist individual email addresses.

Currently the user is able to email me this document (I have an @omimanagement.com email address), but not other people within our organization.

I have our company domain whitelisted on the allow list, however this is being blocked. I have a feeling this has to do with the ""Exchange"" destination rather than just showing the email address as the destination (as shown in the example below) Can someone please help me troubleshoot?

Hi Alin – I appreciate the detail, however I followed the instructions exactly and we are still experiencing the same issue. A sharescreen session would be helpful to fix this issue, as it is setting off multiple false positives within our organization.

 

Thanks

Hi George,

Please try to create an email domain allowlist from server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists - Email domain, and add 'Exchange Administrative Group' value as can be seen here :


Then make sure you include/ check this allowlist inside a content aware policy which targets your machine, in order to take affect.
For example, under policy allowlists section :




Save all changes in server UI and then manually refresh policies from the client machine side.
Then you should be able to send emails to the @omimanagement.com domain.
Let us know the results. Afterwards if any issue persists we can schedule a remote session using Zoom.


Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hello,

Please add the following string in the email domain allowlist : Exchange Administrative Group.
Make sure the allowlist is included in a CAP policy which targets the client machines. Also make sure DPI (Deep packet inspection) is enabled from Device Control > global/ groups/ computer settings.
Afterwards the email whitelist should work. Let us know the results.

Thank you and Best regards,

We would like to allow the emails. We have the policies set up so if the email is being sent internally (to another user with an @omimanagement.com email address) it should be whitelisted. We are not attempting to whitelist individual email addresses.

 

Currently the user is able to email me this document (I have an @omimanagement.com email address), but not other people within our organization.

 

I have our company domain whitelisted on the allow list, however this is being blocked. I have a feeling this has to do with the “Exchange” destination rather than just showing the email address as the destination (as shown in the example below) Can someone please help me troubleshoot?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.
Please clarify what you want to achieve. Do you want to allow the emails ?
If so, since you are using Microsoft Exchange email server, please note the exchange domain list needs to be whitelisted (Exchange Administrative Group) in the email domain whitelist from epp server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists.
In this scenario with Exchange domains, you can only whitelist the whole domain, and NOT individual email addresses like user@domain.com.
You will have to include/ check the email domain whitelist inside a content aware policy which targets the client machines, in order to take effect.
This whitelist feature requires ""Deep Packet Inspection"" setting to be enabled from Device Control > Global settings page.

Hi Alin,

Based on the security incident that we were notified of yesterday, I want to confirm that Netwrix/Endpoint Protector will be updating our server on our behalf since we are a hosted environment by Endpoint Protector. Based on the guidance, it was recommended that we be on at least version 5.9.3, and we are currently running on 5.9.2.

I am unable to change the server version on my own due to the instance being hosted by you. Please advise if there is anything needed on my end. I have pushed out an update to the endpoints to update the client to 6.2.1.2.

Thank you

Hello,

I am writing because our version of Endpoint Protector is still on v5.9.2.0. It was my understanding from the recent security notice that our hosted server would be updated to mitigate the vulnerability on 6/28/2024 at 2pm EST.  Please advise on status and if anything is needed on our end. Thank you

Hi Alin,

Based on the security incident that we were notified of yesterday, I want to confirm that Netwrix/Endpoint Protector will be updating our server on our behalf since we are a hosted environment by Endpoint Protector. Based on the guidance, it was recommended that we be on at least version 5.9.3, and we are currently running on 5.9.2.

I am unable to change the server version on my own due to the instance being hosted by you. Please advise if there is anything needed on my end. I have pushed out an update to the endpoints to update the client to 6.2.1.2.

Thank you

Hello,

As discussed during the meeting, please upgrade to the latest server and client versions.
Note that New Outlook is not supported at this time, only old Outlook.
Additionally all of your licenses are in use, please make sure the computer you are testing on has a valid endpoint license.

Thank you,

Hi Alin - I appreciate the detail, however I followed the instructions exactly and we are still experiencing the same issue. A sharescreen session would be helpful to fix this issue, as it is setting off multiple false positives within our organization.

Hi George,

Please try to create an email domain allowlist from server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists - Email domain, and add 'Exchange Administrative Group' value as can be seen here :
[cid:image002.png@01DACA4A.77EECBA0]

Then make sure you include/ check this allowlist inside a content aware policy which targets your machine, in order to take affect.
For example, under policy allowlists section :
[cid:image003.png@01DACA4A.77EECBA0]



Save all changes in server UI and then manually refresh policies from the client machine side.
Then you should be able to send emails to the @omimanagement.com domain.
Let us know the results. Afterwards if any issue persists we can schedule a remote session using Zoom.


Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hello,

Please add the following string in the email domain allowlist : Exchange Administrative Group.
Make sure the allowlist is included in a CAP policy which targets the client machines. Also make sure DPI (Deep packet inspection) is enabled from Device Control > global/ groups/ computer settings.
Afterwards the email whitelist should work. Let us know the results.

We would like to allow the emails. We have the policies set up so if the email is being sent internally (to another user with an @omimanagement.com email address) it should be whitelisted. We are not attempting to whitelist individual email addresses.

Currently the user is able to email me this document (I have an @omimanagement.com email address), but not other people within our organization.

I have our company domain whitelisted on the allow list, however this is being blocked. I have a feeling this has to do with the ""Exchange"" destination rather than just showing the email address as the destination (as shown in the example below) Can someone please help me troubleshoot?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.
Please clarify what you want to achieve. Do you want to allow the emails ?
If so, since you are using Microsoft Exchange email server, please note the exchange domain list needs to be whitelisted (Exchange Administrative Group) in the email domain whitelist from epp server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists.
In this scenario with Exchange domains, you can only whitelist the whole domain, and NOT individual email addresses like user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>.
You will have to include/ check the email domain whitelist inside a content aware policy which targets the client machines, in order to take effect.
This whitelist feature requires ""Deep Packet Inspection"" setting to be enabled from Device Control > Global settings page.

Alin

Hello,

Are you sure that ""Deep Packet Inspection"" setting is enabled from Device Control > Global settings page ? along with the settings I provided.
If the issue persists let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session using Zoom for next Wednesday or later next week.

Thank you,
Alin

Hi Alin – I appreciate the detail, however I followed the instructions exactly and we are still experiencing the same issue. A sharescreen session would be helpful to fix this issue, as it is setting off multiple false positives within our organization.



Thanks

Hi George,

Please try to create an email domain allowlist from server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists - Email domain, and add 'Exchange Administrative Group' value as can be seen here :
[cid:6232d5ab-8502-4797-917f-fa864970bd9e@Image_2_]

Then make sure you include/ check this allowlist inside a content aware policy which targets your machine, in order to take affect.
For example, under policy allowlists section :
[cid:596c467f-71e8-4c8b-8135-987f107e069d@Image_3_]



Save all changes in server UI and then manually refresh policies from the client machine side.
Then you should be able to send emails to the @omimanagement.com domain.
Let us know the results. Afterwards if any issue persists we can schedule a remote session using Zoom.


Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hello,

Please add the following string in the email domain allowlist : Exchange Administrative Group.
Make sure the allowlist is included in a CAP policy which targets the client machines. Also make sure DPI (Deep packet inspection) is enabled from Device Control > global/ groups/ computer settings.
Afterwards the email whitelist should work. Let us know the results.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BfbDN:ref



We would like to allow the emails. We have the policies set up so if the email is being sent internally (to another user with an @omimanagement.com email address) it should be whitelisted. We are not attempting to whitelist individual email addresses.



Currently the user is able to email me this document (I have an @omimanagement.com email address), but not other people within our organization.



I have our company domain whitelisted on the allow list, however this is being blocked. I have a feeling this has to do with the “Exchange” destination rather than just showing the email address as the destination (as shown in the example below) Can someone please help me troubleshoot?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.
Please clarify what you want to achieve. Do you want to allow the emails ?
If so, since you are using Microsoft Exchange email server, please note the exchange domain list needs to be whitelisted (Exchange Administrative Group) in the email domain whitelist from epp server UI > Denylists and Allowlists - Allowlists.
In this scenario with Exchange domains, you can only whitelist the whole domain, and NOT individual email addresses like user@domain.com<mailto:user@domain.com>.
You will have to include/ check the email domain whitelist inside a content aware policy which targets the client machines, in order to take effect.
This whitelist feature requires ""Deep Packet Inspection"" setting to be enabled from Device Control > Global settings page.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hello,

 

I am writing because our version of Endpoint Protector is still on v5.9.2.0. It was my understanding from the recent security notice that our hosted server would be updated to mitigate the vulnerability on 6/28/2024 at 2pm EST.  Please advise on status and if anything is needed on our end. Thank you

Hi Alin,

 

Based on the security incident that we were notified of yesterday, I want to confirm that Netwrix/Endpoint Protector will be updating our server on our behalf since we are a hosted environment by Endpoint Protector. Based on the guidance, it was recommended that we be on at least version 5.9.3, and we are currently running on 5.9.2.

 

I am unable to change the server version on my own due to the instance being hosted by you. Please advise if there is anything needed on my end. I have pushed out an update to the endpoints to update the client to 6.2.1.2.

 

Thank you

Hello,

As discussed during the meeting, please upgrade to the latest server and client versions.
Note that New Outlook is not supported at this time, only old Outlook.
Additionally all of your licenses are in use, please make sure the computer you are testing on has a valid endpoint license.

Thank you,
Alin
