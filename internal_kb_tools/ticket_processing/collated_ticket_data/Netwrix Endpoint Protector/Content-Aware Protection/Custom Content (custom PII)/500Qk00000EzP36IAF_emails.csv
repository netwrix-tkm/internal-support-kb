Hello Roque,

Here is a test build that you can install on one of the computers and test if the issue can be still reproduced:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1001.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25102024/EPPClient_v6.2.4.1001.zip

Please let me know the outcome once you have the chance to test if the issue can be reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Emil, good morning:

 

On Friday October 4th, we collected some logs from the client ( COOPERATIVA JULIAN LORENTE )  because some policies didn´t work on some computers.

 

Do you have any updates on this issue ?

 

Please let us know ASAP.

 

Saludos cordiales,
