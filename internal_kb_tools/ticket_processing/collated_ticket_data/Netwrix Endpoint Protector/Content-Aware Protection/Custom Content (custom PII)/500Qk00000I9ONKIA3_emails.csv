Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We have received an update from our engineering team, that after they did some more investigations and tests, the reason why the issue is happening is because for those specific files where we don't block the word, we detect a different character encoding than in the other cases.

The character encoding detection uses a probabilistic method. So for text files specifically, other character encoding might be sometimes determined if the text is too short (as in this case where there is only one word in those files).

Generally, this should not happen when there is a larger text in the file.

Please try to redo the tests, by adding more text in the text files, not solely the word that should be blocked. In such situation, the files should be blocked as expected, as the character encoding would be correctly determined.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel,

Previously, I only performed tests using TXT files. Additionally, I tested the same content using PDF, Word, and Excel files.

In TXT files, blocking only occurs when all letters are written in uppercase. However, in PDF, Word, and Excel files, it detected and blocked everything.

I’m also sharing the sample files, screenshot and the screen recording.

Hello Daniel,

As you mentioned, I conducted the tests by adding more data. Currently, the detections are working, and no issues are observed.

It has been a long case. Thank you for all your support throughout the process.
