A few users have reported ERR_connection_closed error while accessing websites for different websites.
The issue disappears when the agent is reloaded.

NOTE: I created a separate ticket from 00415365, because in that case the error in the browser was err_timed_out, and also the error messages in the <a href='https://eppsplit.log' target='_blank'>eppsplit.log</a> file was not the same.

Attaching the logs.","","EPP is causing this error: ""ERR_connection_closed error"" while accessing websites","A test build was provided to the customer and I'm waiting for the confirmation if the issue is addressed.","Solved in 5941","","Emil Podar","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","","","241.8","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Serhat Demir","2024-07-25T15:31:10.000Z","2025-03-24T10:47:26.000Z"
