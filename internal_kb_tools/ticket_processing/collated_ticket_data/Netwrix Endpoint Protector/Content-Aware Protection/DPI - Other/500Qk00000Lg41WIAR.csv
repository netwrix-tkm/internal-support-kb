"500Qk00000Lg41WIAR","00435199","Support Ticket","Unable to enable DPI on client side with MDM","We have successfully downloaded the DPI certificate from the control panel, and deployed with ultimate trust to the certificate using our own MDM solution. However, the user in the ""Certificate added to Keychain/store"" column still shows ""N/A"", and unable to filter by DPI rules.","","","","Currently we do not support customers having custom FQDN names for our Hosted Instances. This is done in order to protect both the anonymity of the customers and also to prevent targeted DDoS attacks. We do not let customers use their own Provided CA certificate as we manage the DNS records for the hosted instances and there is no way on our side to validate those custom domains when needing to reissue these certificates.","","Andrei Pop","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","NONE","","16.4","Closed - Resolved","PremiaLab","Ivan Ip","2025-02-10T01:39:44.000Z","2025-02-26T12:24:42.000Z"
