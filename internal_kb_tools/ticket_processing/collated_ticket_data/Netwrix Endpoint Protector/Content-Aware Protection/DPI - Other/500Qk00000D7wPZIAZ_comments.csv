I am able to connect to Amazon Workspaces in my repro environment.  I have DPI enabled.  However, I also have Stealthy DPI enabled.

The first thing we need to do is understand if enabling stealthy DPI solves the problem.  If not then we need to understand other configuration differences.

The customer requested to update the documentation and specify clearly that the Stealthy DPI Driver is a feature for Windows machines, as we specified for the Intercept VPN Traffic that it is a feature for the Macs.
