Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #415365 - Browsing issue when DPI is enabled [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0DEaAb:ref ]

Hello Serhat,

I received a cumulative test build for the following issues:
00416233 - EPP writes every ~10 seconds a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory
00416109 - ERR_connection_closed error while accessing websites
00416619 - ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error while accessing websites
00415365 - Browsing issue when DPI is enabled
00414948 - Client DPI Enables support for deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites


Here are the download links for the agents (Windows+Mac):
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0057.zip
Mac: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPMac3.0.3.0024.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if any of the issues can be still reproduced on your environment using the latest test build.

Thank you and Best regards,
Emil

Hello Serhat,

Here is a download link for the test build which should address this issue:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp26082024/EPPMac3.0.3.0022.Notarized.tar
As my colleague suggested, the issue can be reproduced by overloading the tasks in the web browser. For example you can open multiple tabs in the web browser and then to switch between them frequently.

If the issue can be reproduced, please collect a set of logs and send them over in order to investigate this further.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Emil,
The web access issue happened again in my endpoint.
Slack was not accessible either.
