We recently starting rolling out the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to our employees and we're seeing the EppClient process slowing down workstations...

Most of our staff are software engineers (myself included) and we can see the EppClient spike to using 100~150% CPU when doing disk ""heavy"" operations.
These aren't super disk heavy operations, just fairly standard things with tools like our version control (git) or code editors (VsCode / InteliJ).

Sometimes it's just hogging up CPU, but at other times it also seems to be slowing down the actions we're doing along the way!

Do you have any suggestions on how to reduce this pain?

Are there ways to exclude specific processes, paths, or files from being scanned by Netwrix?

Regards,

Ruben de Vries

Recommended them to try to deselect from the CAP policy > Exit Point > Github Client, and to select under Policy Denylist > Source Code > Restricted Apps > Git
Another scenario that they may try is to add the file path under Allowlist > File Location and see if the performances improves in this way.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-02-12T16:01:22.000Z"

- wait for a confirmation from them if the issue is resolved","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-02-12T16:02:02.000Z"
