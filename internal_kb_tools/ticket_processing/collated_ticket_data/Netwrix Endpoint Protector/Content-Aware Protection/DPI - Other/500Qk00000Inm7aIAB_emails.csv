Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

We are aware of this issue and our Product team confirmed that the fix will be included in the next EPP Server release, version 5.9.4.1.  We are in the final stages of testing version 5.9.4.1 and will release it soon in December.

I would also like to highlight that this does not affect the wellbeing of the product or its ability to apply the desired policies and setting correctly - but its much more a matter on how the settings are displayed. In the meanwhile you can use the following workaround:

	If you make a change to one of the CAP policies then you need to select the DPI Allowlist dictionaries again before saving.

I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards
