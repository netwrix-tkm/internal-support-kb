Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our Engineering team, regarding the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)
Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #424664 - - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HKZUT:ref ]

Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

 1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
 2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
 3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
 4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team
We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category
Scenario 1:
DPI – Enabled
Intercept VPN – Enabled
Upload – Allowed

Scenario 2:
               DPI – Enabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – Allowed

Scenario 3:
               DPI – Disabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – blocked

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.
DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.


 1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
 2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
 3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
 4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
 5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)


I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.
We cannot function like this.

Importance: High

Hi Stefania/Natalia,

MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.
We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.

This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:~WRD0001.jpg]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:~WRD0001.jpg]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[cid:~WRD0001.jpg]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[cid:~WRD0001.jpg]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,

As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Thank you for getting back to us. 

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations. 

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello, 

Thank you all for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working. 

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected. 

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not. 

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

 

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked 

 

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

 

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

 

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not. 

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,

 

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.

 

Intermittent Internet issue (browser)MS Teams not allowing uploads.Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.Android Studio (ADB) not workingUploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)

 

 

I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted. 

We cannot function like this.

Hi Stefania/Natalia,

 

MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.

 

This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps: 

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0001.jpg]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0001.jpg]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0001.jpg]

9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[Inline image name : ~WRD0001.jpg]

Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support/Daniel,

 

As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)
Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

  1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
  2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
  3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
  4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team
We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category
Scenario 1:
DPI – Enabled
Intercept VPN – Enabled
Upload – Allowed

Scenario 2:
               DPI – Enabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – Allowed

Scenario 3:
               DPI – Disabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – blocked

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.
DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.


  1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
  2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
  3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
  4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
  5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)


I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.
We cannot function like this.

Importance: High

Hi Stefania/Natalia,

MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.
We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.

This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[Image removed by sender.]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,

As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hello Naveen,
 

Thank you for getting back to us. 

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations. 

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello, 

Thank you all for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working. 

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected. 

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not. 

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

 

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked 

 

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

 

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

 

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not. 

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,

 

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.

 

Intermittent Internet issue (browser)MS Teams not allowing uploads.Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.Android Studio (ADB) not workingUploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)

 

 

I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted. 

We cannot function like this.

Importance: High

 

Hi Stefania/Natalia,

 

MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.

 

This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps: 

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0000.jpg]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0000.jpg]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[Inline image name : ~WRD0000.jpg]

9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support/Daniel,

 

As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

ESCALATION !!

Hi @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa <Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com><mailto:Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com>, @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com<mailto:stefania.oltean@netwrix.com>, @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:natalia.ticu@netwrix.com>

It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.
We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.

We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.

We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)
Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

 1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
 2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
 3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
 4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team
We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category
Scenario 1:
DPI – Enabled
Intercept VPN – Enabled
Upload – Allowed

Scenario 2:
               DPI – Enabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – Allowed

Scenario 3:
               DPI – Disabled
               Intercept VPN – Disabled
               Upload – blocked

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HKZUT:ref


Hi All,

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.
DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.


 1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
 2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
 3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
 4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
 5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)


I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.
We cannot function like this.

Importance: High

Hi Stefania/Natalia,

MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.
We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.

This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:~WRD1475.jpg]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:~WRD1475.jpg]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[cid:~WRD1475.jpg]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[cid:~WRD1475.jpg]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,

As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hi Shashank,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for bringing this case to our attention.

We checked the support case 424664 - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI and we noticed that our Support Team informed you on 28th  October,  related to the DPI for application, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Can you please confirm the receipt of this email and if this support case number 424664 can be closed?

Moreover, can you please let us know if the case related to DPI that you are referring to, it is case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files?

If that is the case, I would like to inform you that this ticket is already escalated with our Engineering team. Our team is currently working to investigate this reported issue. Once we have an update, we'll definitely let you know.

We are going to continue to follow up on this case in order to make sure next steps will be provided soon.

Thank you for your understanding,
Alexandra

ESCALATION !!

Hi @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa <Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com><mailto:Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com>, @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com<mailto:stefania.oltean@netwrix.com>, @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:natalia.ticu@netwrix.com>



It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.

We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.



We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.



We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,



One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

  1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
  2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
  3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
  4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.



Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed



Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed



Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked



The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.



Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.



Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HKZUT:ref



Hi All,



Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.



  1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
  2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
  3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
  4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
  5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)





I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.

We cannot function like this.





Best Regards,

Importance: High



Hi Stefania/Natalia,



MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.



This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[Image removed by sender.]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[Image removed by sender.]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,



As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hi Alexandra,

Yes, we are talking about the case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files.

I understand that this has been escalated to engineering, but what about timelines on the resolution ?
DPI functionality is highly important and almost all policies/use-cases we want to achieve are dependent on this.

Subject: Re: Netwrix Support Ticket #424664 - - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HKZUT:ref ]


You don't often get email from alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com>. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>

Hi Shashank,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for bringing this case to our attention.

We checked the support case 424664 - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI and we noticed that our Support Team informed you on 28th  October,  related to the DPI for application, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Can you please confirm the receipt of this email and if this support case number 424664 can be closed?

Moreover, can you please let us know if the case related to DPI that you are referring to, it is case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files?

If that is the case, I would like to inform you that this ticket is already escalated with our Engineering team. Our team is currently working to investigate this reported issue. Once we have an update, we'll definitely let you know.

We are going to continue to follow up on this case in order to make sure next steps will be provided soon.

Thank you for your understanding,
Alexandra

ESCALATION !!

Hi @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa <Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com><mailto:Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com>, @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com<mailto:stefania.oltean@netwrix.com>, @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:natalia.ticu@netwrix.com>



It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.

We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.



We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.



We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,



One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #424664 - - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HKZUT:ref ]



Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

 1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
 2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
 3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
 4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.



Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed



Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed



Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked



The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.



Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.



Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi All,



Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.



 1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
 2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
 3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
 4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
 5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)





I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.

We cannot function like this.





Best Regards,

Importance: High



Hi Stefania/Natalia,



MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.



This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:image009.jpg@01DB35BF.0FF769E0]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:image009.jpg@01DB35BF.0FF769E0]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[cid:image009.jpg@01DB35BF.0FF769E0]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[cid:image009.jpg@01DB35BF.0FF769E0]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,



As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hi Alexandra,



Yes, we are talking about the case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files.

I understand that this has been escalated to engineering, but what about timelines on the resolution ?

DPI functionality is highly important and almost all policies/use-cases we want to achieve are dependent on this.

You don't often get email from alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com>. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>

Hi Shashank,



Thank you for reaching out to us and for bringing this case to our attention.



We checked the support case 424664 - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI and we noticed that our Support Team informed you on 28th  October,  related to the DPI for application, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.



Can you please confirm the receipt of this email and if this support case number 424664 can be closed?



Moreover, can you please let us know if the case related to DPI that you are referring to, it is case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files?



If that is the case, I would like to inform you that this ticket is already escalated with our Engineering team. Our team is currently working to investigate this reported issue. Once we have an update, we'll definitely let you know.



We are going to continue to follow up on this case in order to make sure next steps will be provided soon.



Thank you for your understanding,

Alexandra

ESCALATION !!

It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.

We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.



We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.



We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our Engineering team, regarding the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,



One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #424664 - - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HKZUT:ref ]



Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

  1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
  2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
  3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
  4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.



Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed



Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed



Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked



The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.



Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.



Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,



Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.



  1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
  2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
  3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
  4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
  5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)





I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.

We cannot function like this.

Hi Stefania/Natalia,



MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.



This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[Image removed by sender.]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[Image removed by sender.]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[Image removed by sender.]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,



As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hi Alexandra,



Yes, we are talking about the case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files.

I understand that this has been escalated to engineering, but what about timelines on the resolution ?

DPI functionality is highly important and almost all policies/use-cases we want to achieve are dependent on this.

You don't often get email from alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com<mailto:alexandra.bolfa@netwrix.com>. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>


Hi Shashank,



Thank you for reaching out to us and for bringing this case to our attention.



We checked the support case 424664 - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI and we noticed that our Support Team informed you on 28th  October,  related to the DPI for application, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.



Can you please confirm the receipt of this email and if this support case number 424664 can be closed?



Moreover, can you please let us know if the case related to DPI that you are referring to, it is case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files?



If that is the case, I would like to inform you that this ticket is already escalated with our Engineering team. Our team is currently working to investigate this reported issue. Once we have an update, we'll definitely let you know.



We are going to continue to follow up on this case in order to make sure next steps will be provided soon.



Thank you for your understanding,

Alexandra

ESCALATION !!

Hi @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa <Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com><mailto:Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com>, @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com<mailto:stefania.oltean@netwrix.com>, @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com<mailto:natalia.ticu@netwrix.com>



It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.

We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.



We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.



We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,


Thank you for getting back to us.

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations.

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,



One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #424664 - - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HKZUT:ref ]



Hello,

Thank you all for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working.

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

 1.  00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI
 2.  00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday
 3.  00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team
 4.  00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected.

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not.

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.



Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed



Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed



Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked



The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.



Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.



Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not.

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed.

Have a nice day ahead!

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HKZUT:ref



Hi All,



Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.



 1.  Intermittent Internet issue (browser)
 2.  MS Teams not allowing uploads.
 3.  Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.
 4.  Android Studio (ADB) not working
 5.  Uploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)





I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.

We cannot function like this.

Hi Stefania/Natalia,



MS Teams is a day-to-day application widely used within our environment and this upload issue due to DPI of Netwrix is affecting a lot of people randomly.

We already disabled DPI for the MS Teams application globally (snippet below), but still this doesn’t Help.

Unless we manually disable the DPI at the User level (considering global right is selected for User) it doesn’t work.



This was not the case during our POC and now in production this is really becoming a problem and needs immediate attention.

Hello Navneet,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed about new Teams issue, that we are aware of it and we are working on a fix, that will be added in the 5.9.5 version.
For the moment we do not have an ETA when the version will be released.

Until that, can you please gather a set of logs from the affected machine while you are reproducing the issue, using the following steps:

1. Download our Support Tool here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .ZIP archive in a new folder.
3. Run the executable file ""SupportTool_x64.exe"" with administrator privileges.
4. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:image006.jpg@01DB35D7.A78BF650]

5. Click on the the drop down menu and select ""Create DPI Log File"" and then click on ""Execute""

[cid:image006.jpg@01DB35D7.A78BF650]

6. Leave the support tool open and running in background
7. Reproduce the issue or retest scenario of issue.
8. After the issue was reproduced / retested, return to our EPP Support Tool and click on ""Export Files""

[cid:image006.jpg@01DB35D7.A78BF650]



9. In the same folder of which you extracted the Support Tool files please make a selection of all the files exported by the tool and put them in a .ZIP archive as shown in the below screenshot.  The next step would be to send the .ZIP archive to us.

[cid:image006.jpg@01DB35D7.A78BF650]


Regarding the issue with the notifications, Tamper mode is affecting the notifications. Can you please verify under your operating system if the EPP notifications are blocked or stopped.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi @Netwrix Support<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>/Daniel,



As shown in the snippet below, the DPI feature for Microsoft team has been specifically disabled. However, the end users are still experiencing upload issues. The issue is only resolved when the DPI feature is disabled for the individual user through the User settings.

Hi Alexandra,

 

Yes, we are talking about the case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files.

I understand that this has been escalated to engineering, but what about timelines on the resolution ? 

DPI functionality is highly important and almost all policies/use-cases we want to achieve are dependent on this.

Hi Shashank, 

 

Thank you for reaching out to us and for bringing this case to our attention. 

 

We checked the support case 424664 - User Facing Issue with Teams Upload due to DPI and we noticed that our Support Team informed you on 28th  October,  related to the DPI for application, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

 

Can you please confirm the receipt of this email and if this support case number 424664 can be closed?

 

Moreover, can you please let us know if the case related to DPI that you are referring to, it is case number 00423648, DPI Blocking the required files?

 

If that is the case, I would like to inform you that this ticket is already escalated with our Engineering team. Our team is currently working to investigate this reported issue. Once we have an update, we'll definitely let you know. 

 

We are going to continue to follow up on this case in order to make sure next steps will be provided soon. 

 

Thank you for your understanding,

Alexandra

ESCALATION !!

Hi @Alexandra-Diana Bolfa <Alexandra.Bolfa@netwrix.com>, @stefania.oltean@netwrix.com, @natalia.ticu@netwrix.com

 

It’s been 3+ weeks now with no resolution.

We are losing trust on the product as the most important functionality of the product is not behaving the way it should.

 

We have not pushed any policies organization wide due to this misbehaviour of DPI functionality and thus we have no controls on the DLP as such.

I hope you understand the importance of DLP in place and such gap can lead to unforeseen circumstances.

 

We need a resolution at the earliest.

Hello Naveen,
 

Thank you for getting back to us. 

On the 28 October, we have informed you about  the DPI for application question, that if you disable DPI for that application, it will not monitor using DPI that application.
It will still monitor it using regular (no DPI) CAP. So EPP will monitor it when it accesses files, and block/report access if needed, and not when the files are actually transferred.

Regarding the other issue that you have, the cases are still under our Engineering team investigations. 

As soon as we receive an update regarding them, we will inform you accordingly.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

One more point to clarify is :

Whether disabling DPI globally blocks uploads to any destination from any exit points or vice-versa if a policy is applied to user. (Policy based on selected exit points/policy denylist/DPI monitored URL categories)

Asking this because in the DPI Applications ‘Disable’ option is also there. So, if this DPI application option works same like the above statement, then all User’s shouldn’t be able to share over teams currently as per our current setup.

Hello, 

Thank you all for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have investigated the situations encountered, tested several scenarios that were not working. 

Regarding the cases you have raised with us, here are their statuses:

00424664 – User Facing Issue with the Teams Upload due to DPI | fixed after we enabled the Intercept VPN / Stealthy DPI00424934 – Users Unable to Access Key Application | for Monday00423648 – DPI Blocking the required files | - Pending response from our Engineering team00422679 – Upload is not denied in MS Teams | - Pending response from our Engineering team

We will also add the Scenario where the Gmail – Only sometimes are the uploads blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely. If I disconnect and reconnect the Internet, then again, the policy starts blocking the uploads, and after some time, it allows them.

Beside this, I will create an internal investigations for the pop ups that are not showing while the threat is detected. 

Also, this case will be forwarded to our Engineering team to investigate if we disable the DPI on the Application side, are the transfers still going or not. 

For the situation when you are switching the network from network 1 to network 2, please when it will happen again, collect a set of logs with the support tool and sent them to us.

Please let us know if you didn't mention any points so we can added to the investigation side. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note that, on the same mac machine where we tested by enabling the DPI and Intercept VPN (teams upload stuck issue was resolved), we tested the other policy and it didn’t work as intended, see below.

 

Policy: To block uploads on WhatsApp (mac) – whatsapp domain is added to the DPI URL Category

Scenario 1:

DPI – Enabled

Intercept VPN – Enabled

Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 2:

               DPI – Enabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – Allowed

 

Scenario 3:

               DPI – Disabled

               Intercept VPN – Disabled

               Upload – blocked

 

The above-mentioned issue is similar to the other issue with ticket 00423648 where we tested on the virsutotal website and recorded the issue.

 

Kindly assist in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

 

Thanks

Hello Shashank,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have discussed the encountered issues and solved two of them after we enabled Intercept VPN function.

Also, I will raise an internal case regarding your question with DPI applications if they are bypassed or not. 

Please check the users and let us know if you receive any complains about upload speed. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi All,

 

Please note that the problem is not only with MS Teams, rather with all such apps that can be controlled by the DPI functionality.

DPI is really misbehaving and has choked multiple users on their day-to-day work.

 

Intermittent Internet issue (browser)MS Teams not allowing uploads.Apps like Apache Jmeter (Java dependent) getting blocked.Android Studio (ADB) not workingUploads if working is really really slow (.06 MB)

 

 

I need a TAM or an SME on the DPI to connect at the earliest with us over a call and get things sorted.

We cannot function like this.
