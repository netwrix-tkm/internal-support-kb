Thank you for your email.
Can you please let us know their server version?
Where are the hosted? Prem/cloud/by us?
Also very important question- Did they applied the ""hotfix"" update from either the console or the offline update patch?

Thank you for your email.
Yes, we should have a call in this case.
Do you have root access on the server as well? Also, upon checking, I do not see a customer named ""Aeon Bank"" hosted by us,
what is their exact name?
Because if you are missing root access, I will need to request access from my end, but I would need their exact name to identify them correctly.

Thank you for your time today!
As mentioned, I will list here the summary of our discussion.

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
We are currently as mentioned aware of this issue,and are actively working on a fix to address the logs missing.
We do not have an exact date when this will be applied, but it is our top priority and the  patch for the hotfix should become available soon.
