I'm creating current ticket on behalf of Directi team that reported that the CAP policy is not applying for email subject and email body although under Content Aware Protection > Deep Packet Inspection:
Monitor webmail - is turned ON
Outlook is selected from the ""Select Parser:"" dropdown
DPI is enabled for the Windows computer where tests were performed

EPP Server version: 5.9.4.1.
