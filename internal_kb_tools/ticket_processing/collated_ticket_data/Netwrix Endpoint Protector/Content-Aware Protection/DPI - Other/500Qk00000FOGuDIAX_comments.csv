@WaitingOnEngineer I managed to reproduce this once on Windows but not on Mac. 
Chrome browser recently had an update and we are not ruling out that as the possible problem on Windows. Does the problem persist on other browsers?
On Mac side however there seems to be a problem related to the certificates. Is the certificate added to the browser?
Also the cause could be the Falcon client that seems to be attempting to start every minute. Have you tried the scenario without Falcon and Fortinet clients?
The log is long but there are only some requests at the end. Have tested more scenarios? Is adobe an isolated case? Does the detection work on other websites like https://dlptest.endpointprotector.com?
As the scenarios were tried in July please retry them with newer agents as there were a lot of fixes since then and collect logs as they will provide the details of the problem more accurately. You can find mac and windows clients here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_11_04
Thank you.
