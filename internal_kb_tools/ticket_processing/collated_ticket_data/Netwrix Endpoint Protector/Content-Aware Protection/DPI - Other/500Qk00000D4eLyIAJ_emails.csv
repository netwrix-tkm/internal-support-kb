Below you can find the download links for a test build for both Win and Mac where the OpenSSL library was updated to version 3.0 LTS. This will remove some deprecated ciphers.

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EppClient_v6.2.4.1004.zip
Mac: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19112024/EPPMac3.0.4.1004.Notarized.tar

This change will also be applied to the EPP Clients from the 5.9.4.1 Server version.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil & Adrian,
 

I tested with EPP Agent v3.0.3.0024.

 

I attached the supported TLS cipher suites in the client side in Chrome and Firefox when DPI is enabled and disabled.

I can confirm that now deprecated TLS versions are disabled when DPI is enabled. Good, thanks.

Though, still, when DPI is enabled, the client supports many more weak cipher suites compared to the default behaviour as can be seen in the attached results. There is still room for improvement on that side for you to evaluate and consider.

 

Thanks,

-serhat

Hello Serhat,

I received a cumulative test build for the following issues:
00416233 - EPP writes every ~10 seconds a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory
00416109 - ERR_connection_closed error while accessing websites
00416619 - ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error while accessing websites
00415365 - Browsing issue when DPI is enabled
00414948 - Client DPI Enables support for deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites


Here are the download links for the agents (Windows+Mac):
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0057.zip
Mac: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPMac3.0.3.0024.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if any of the issues can be still reproduced on your environment using the latest test build.

Thank you and Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,
 

What is the solution? Is it to copy the default behaviour of the client or MitM will have a new limited set of TLS versions and cipher suites?

 

Thanks,
