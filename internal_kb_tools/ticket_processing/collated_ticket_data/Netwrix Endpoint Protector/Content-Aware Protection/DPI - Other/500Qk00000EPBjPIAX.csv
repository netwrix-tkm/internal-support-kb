Our customer is using the Forti ZTNA product. They are monitoring several resource web addresses in ZTNA, and these addresses are only accessible when ZTNA is active.

There are no issues when the DPI feature is disabled. However, when DPI is enabled, they are unable to access the websites specified in ZTNA.

We conducted various tests. When DPI is active and no exit points are selected in the CAP, there is no problem. But when DPI is active and any exit point is selected, the specified websites cannot be accessed (even when the policy action is set to only reporting mode).

Debug mode was enabled, and the issue was replicated. I’m sharing the log in the attachment.

The issue is occurring on Windows operating systems.

I look forward to your response regarding this matter.","","","","Stealthy DPI needed to be activated on that computer","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","","","8.1","Closed - Resolved","Roof Stacks Yazılım","Faruk Sarı","2024-08-14T10:35:57.000Z","2024-08-22T12:08:29.000Z"
