Can I have an update on this ticket?
Also, would it possible to have someone from the Server team in a meeting with the customer so they can investigate more exactly what is causing the slowness when DPI is enabled?

@WaitingOnEngineer

This looks like a server issue. Did you collect any EPP client logs so that we can take a look to see what the agents are doing? Maybe sending a lot of logs? Even though I doubt that could happen with DPI enabled.

@WaitingOnEngineer

I've checked the two sets of logs received. Nothing suspicious on the client side. In the first set of logs, there was only one threat generated in half an hour. For the second set of logs, no threats at all. So I don't see anything on the client side that could trigger load on the server (such as multiple logs generated in a short period of time). So I think this should be checked on the server side as well. 

I have a question, are we sure that only with DPI enabled the issue is reproduced?

Hi, 



Please try to monitor on the server the number of logs received from the agent, when DPI is disabled and enabled. (provide some screenshots)

1. Disable the DPI, and restart the services;
> service mysql restart
> service nginx restart
> service php-fpm restart

2. Check the htop(provide some printscreens)

check the quicklogs directory:
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/*
du -sh /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/*

find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/logs/ -type f | wc -l
find /var/eppfiles/quicklogs/worker/* -type f | wc -l


 3. wait ~ 10 min and run again the above commands


4. Enable DPI:
- run again the above commands
- allow time for the CPU utilization to rise
- run again the commands

5. login into MySQL and check the processes that are running (run the command multiple times):
 - SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;


Check on the UI the CAP logs that were added when DPI was enabled.

Please if it's possible organize them.

Hi Emil,

Could you please check if there are duplicated devices?

If so, please try to apply the procedure to remove them.

Also, I  noticed one user (id = 404) who tried multiple times to update device information.

check the user name: 
SELECT id, username FROM clientuser WHERE id = 404;

that user is connected to the machine with id 242. 
SELECT id, name FROM clientmachine WHERE id = 242;

Collect the logs from that machine. (When DPI is enabled)

Additionally, please provide the rights set on devices for that user and machine. On the Clientmachine page, search for the machine and select the 'Manage Rights' action.
Do the same with the user rights. ( provide some screenshots )

Please try to clean the rights cache tables. Once the agent communicates with the server, this data will be regenerated.

delete from rights_machine;
delete from rights_group;
delete from rights_user;


Regards,
Augustina
