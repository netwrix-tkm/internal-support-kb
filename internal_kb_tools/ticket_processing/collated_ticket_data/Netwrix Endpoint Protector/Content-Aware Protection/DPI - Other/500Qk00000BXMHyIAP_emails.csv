Eduard .

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don't get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0.
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

Thank you,

Morning Guys ,

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine ( D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to ""Block and Report  ""  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don't generate any Alert as well .

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled...

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed:

[cid:image006.png@01DB2EAF.F360BF40]

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it's not in Applications and I can't find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it's uninstalled? Haha

What are next steps?

It might have been a certificate issue due to the wrong expected version of Chrome. It's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah, just let me know if you see this happening again even on another computer.

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Thank you,

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hey Eduard! <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I'm just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don't have either EPP option in this my settings. I'm guessing it's specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting.

Hey Eduard!

I'm not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn't think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I'm just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says ""Transparent Proxy"".

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Thank you,

Thank you for testing the agent. The next step is to gather a new set of logs and ask a different question from engineering: if text inspection is possible on the apps based on what the logs contain?
Can we set up a short session tomorrow to gather the logs?

Eduard .

 

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don’t get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

 

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

 

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0. 
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

Thank you,

Morning Guys ,

 

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine (  D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

 

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

 

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to “Block and Report  “  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

 

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don’t generate any Alert as well .

 

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

 

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled…

 

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed: 
 



 

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it’s not in Applications and I can’t find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it’s uninstalled? Haha

 

What are next steps?

It might have been a certificate issue due to the wrong expected version of Chrome. It's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah, just let me know if you see this happening again even on another computer.

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Hi Eduard – Unfortunately, I am seeing EPP issues where I am no longer able to connect to web sockets. So for me Asana and Figma are failing right now. I am unsure if the web socket allow toggle got flipped again or not.

 

Here are my current VPN and filter settings:



Best,
Daniel

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hey Eduard! 

 

Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I’m just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don’t have either EPP option in this my settings. I’m guessing it’s specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting. 
 

Ryan’s settings:

Hey Eduard!

I’m not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. 

 

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn’t think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I’m just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says “Transparent Proxy”.
 


 

Thanks!

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Hi Imran,

Thank you for testing the agent. The next step is to gather a new set of logs and ask a different question from engineering: if text inspection is possible on the apps based on what the logs contain?
Can we set up a short session tomorrow to gather the logs?

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

It don't Block the user incase just entering sensitive Text on those Apps and NO alert is generating on EPP,    whereas works  fine in case of File Upload with Sensitive Information . So now how you want us to procced on this issue ?  Thanks

Eduard .

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don't get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0.
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

Thank you,

Morning Guys ,

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine ( D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to ""Block and Report  ""  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don't generate any Alert as well .

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled...

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed:

[cid:image007.png@01DB2EB4.BAA10F70]

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it's not in Applications and I can't find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it's uninstalled? Haha

What are next steps?

It might have been a certificate issue due to the wrong expected version of Chrome. It's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah, just let me know if you see this happening again even on another computer.

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Thank you,

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Eduard! <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I'm just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don't have either EPP option in this my settings. I'm guessing it's specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting.

Hey Eduard!

I'm not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn't think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I'm just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says ""Transparent Proxy"".

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Thank you,

Hi Imran,

Thank you for testing the agent. The next step is to gather a new set of logs and ask a different question from engineering: if text inspection is possible on the apps based on what the logs contain?
Can we set up a short session tomorrow to gather the logs?

Thank you,

It don’t Block the user incase just entering sensitive Text on those Apps and NO alert is generating on EPP,    whereas works  fine in case of File Upload with Sensitive Information . So now how you want us to procced on this issue ?  Thanks

Eduard .

 

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don’t get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

 

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

 

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0. 
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

Thank you,

Morning Guys ,

 

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine (  D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

 

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

 

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to “Block and Report  “  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

 

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don’t generate any Alert as well .

 

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

 

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled…

 

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed: 
 



 

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it’s not in Applications and I can’t find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it’s uninstalled? Haha

 

What are next steps?

It might have been a certificate issue due to the wrong expected version of Chrome. It's the only thing I can think of.

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Hi Eduard – Unfortunately, I am seeing EPP issues where I am no longer able to connect to web sockets. So for me Asana and Figma are failing right now. I am unsure if the web socket allow toggle got flipped again or not.

 

Here are my current VPN and filter settings:



Best,
Daniel

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hey Eduard! 

 

Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I’m just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don’t have either EPP option in this my settings. I’m guessing it’s specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting.

I’m not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. 

 

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn’t think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I’m just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says “Transparent Proxy”.
 


 

Thanks!

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Thank you,

Hi Imran,

Thank you for testing the agent. The next step is to gather a new set of logs and ask a different question from engineering: if text inspection is possible on the apps based on what the logs contain?
Can we set up a short session tomorrow to gather the logs?

Eduard .

 

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don’t get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

 

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

 

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0. 
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

Morning Guys ,

 

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine (  D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

 

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

 

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to “Block and Report  “  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

 

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don’t generate any Alert as well .

 

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

 

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled…

 

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed: 
 



 

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it’s not in Applications and I can’t find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it’s uninstalled? Haha

 

What are next steps?

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Hi Eduard – Unfortunately, I am seeing EPP issues where I am no longer able to connect to web sockets. So for me Asana and Figma are failing right now. I am unsure if the web socket allow toggle got flipped again or not.

 

Here are my current VPN and filter settings:

Daniel

Thank you, Lucinda,

Sounds good. Let's wait until next week and if everything is still okay then we will see about closing the issue.

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Eduard! 

 

Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I’m just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don’t have either EPP option in this my settings. I’m guessing it’s specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting.

Hey Eduard!

I’m not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. 

 

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn’t think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I’m just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says “Transparent Proxy”.
 


 

Thanks!

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Hi Imran,

Thank you for testing the agent. The next step is to gather a new set of logs and ask a different question from engineering: if text inspection is possible on the apps based on what the logs contain?
Can we set up a short session tomorrow to gather the logs?

Eduard .

Poonum has the latest version, and she is also facing the same issue .   Means   when they try to enter some sensitive information on any those 3 apps ( Web + Desktop both )   they don't get any pop-up block message notification   and also no Alert creates at EPP console .

But when they use any file upload on same 3 apps ,  Yes they got pop up block message notification   and also Alert creates at EPP console .

Regarding the New build you just sent , I can work with Lucinda to get it install on Daniel machine and try one more time .

Hey Imran,

It seems that Daniel is using an older agent version than the one provided in 5.9.4.0.
Can you try with the latest agent?
It might also be worth checking with a test build I received on another case regarding DPI functionality.
Please download this client and just install it for test purposes on a computer or two: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp15102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1000.Notarized.tar
Please let me know if any works with text inspecting.

I just checked ,  did test with Daniel Machine ( D3R4NLKQHV ) .      And nothing is showing up on EPP side  , means  in case of just writing sensitive content upload on the applications   ( not the file upload )     to  any of the those 3  Apps ,   no policy Alert generates  and  not even blocking the user .

@ Eduard , can we have remote session , I can  bring Lucinda and TRIM user on the call . Thanks

Hey Imran,

The only thing that might have changed is that ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" is enabled. Please make sure it is disabled for the Trim group and let me know if that changes the outcome.

Eduard ,

There is something wrong with TRIM policy ,  as of now we have set it to ""Block and Report  ""  and if a user Try to upload any file containing sensitive information get block and user is getting Pop message on their screen  ( see pic below )  while using those 3 apps . It is also reporting on EPP console as an Alert .

But when they just simply type the sensitive content on their Browser ( chrome )  and process it ( like comment box )  ,  they able to do it  and EPP console don't generate any Alert as well .

I have tested with Poonum and Daniel , both having same issue .

Just a reminder that Poonum just  got Fresh copy of Client installed  on her Laptop .  Please reply with your remote session availability if needed or Suggest if we need to do additional configurations on the console side . Thanks

Hey! I think we got it uninstalled...

I remoted in and executed the script and this is what it showed:

[cid:image007.png@01DB3677.0662ADA0]

But the app was still in Applications. We ran it again and same thing. So, then I had Poonum drag/drop to trash and that seemed to remove the app, like it's not in Applications and I can't find it when searching from Spotlight. So I think it's uninstalled? Haha

What are next steps?

Thanks,

It might have been a certificate issue due to the wrong expected version of Chrome. It's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah, just let me know if you see this happening again even on another computer.

Hey Daniel,

I would check the setting on your computer and see if something changed there since you were on custom rights.
If it work on all the rest of the computers that are part of the group, I would just restore the global settings for your computer and see how it goes.
If you manage the settings for you computer in the console, the last option in the page is restore global settings.
Let me know if that fixes the access issue.

Thank you,

Hey Lucinda,

The transparent proxy is exactly that, a local proxy that is used by the dpi function to check packets for restricted content. This way we catch restricted content even before they try to leave the computer.
As for the VPN connection, that is something we had to introduce since Sonoma changed the way security is handled and that was the only workaround to be able to set the proxy. This has no actual use once the proxy is enabled, and it might even be disabled under regular work conditions.
If you are not part of a group that enabled DPI, this is not needed or set.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Eduard! <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>
Just for my own knowledge, what do the VPN and the Transparent Proxy do? I'm just noticing that the Trim users have both, but I don't have either EPP option in this my settings. I'm guessing it's specifically for the Trim DLP policies, but I just thought it would be useful to know for future troubleshooting.

Hey Lucinda,

Sure thing, just let me know your availability and I can set up a teams meeting. Just let me know who needs to be invited, or just set it up and send me the invite after I confirm the timeslot.

Thank you,

Hey Eduard!

I'm not sure where you and Imran left off, but I do have some users seeing issues with being able to access a few Trim sites (Confluence, Figma, Slab, Notion, Asana). It does seem related to EPP, because one of the affected users disabled the Filter in Mac Settings > Network > Filters, and then he was able to access the sites. <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

 <https://try.netwrix.com/netwrix_connect_us_2024>

Could we try to hop on a call about this tomorrow? I didn't think I had access, but turns out I can sign in to the EPP portal, so I think I can update what we need to. I'm just not sure what the setting is. haha

Reference: To fix, the user disabled the part at the bottom that says ""Transparent Proxy"".

Hey Imran,

As a quick update here, we managed to get everything working for Daniel. We had to install the latest EPP agent, and we also managed to find the domain used by Asana and add that to the list.
Let me know after you manage to test with another colleague using the same configuration.
For anything else, please feel free to send me an email and I will try to do my best to be available.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
