Item will be covered by doc task #362935

RAW input:

Download the archived certificates from the EPP server.
Unzip the certificates: unzip ClientCerts.zip
We will use cacert.pem from the archive

For debian based (like ubuntu)
Copy the certificate: sudo cp cacert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
(Important to make it .crt)
Update the certificate store: sudo update-ca-certificates

For redhat based (like rhel/fedora)
Copy the certificate: sudo cp cacert.pem etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
Update the certificate store: sudo update-ca-trust


Some reference links:
https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install-a-root-ca-certificate-in-the-trust-store
https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/configure-ca-trust-list

In future all DOC related task should be raised by helpcenter portal.
