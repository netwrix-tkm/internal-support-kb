We are facing a strange behavior where the excel process get slower, like changing cells and using clipboard when a specific policy is enabled. When its disable, works properly. The excell file is on the computer, so no issues with network sharing, and the policy doesnt show any report, so we cant troubleshoot normally. Let me know if you can join a meeting today 14h BRT or another time of your availability this week.

Best regards,","","4/23/2025
