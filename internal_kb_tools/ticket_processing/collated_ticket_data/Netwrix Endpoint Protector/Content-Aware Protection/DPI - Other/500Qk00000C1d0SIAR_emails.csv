Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We would recommend that you also upgrade the EPP client to the latest version ""v6.2.2.1"" which contains DPI improvements.

In addition to upgrading the EPP client please also turn on ""Peer Certificate Validation"" and ""DPI Bypass"" under ""DPI Configuration"". See below screenshot as example.





You can also add the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Allowlists"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" and then select it also under ""Policy Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"" of an active Content Aware Policy.

Please do let us know if this help to resolve the issue which you are experiencing.

Yes you can also collect the diagnostics (logs) remotely.  Please follow the instructions on the attached PDF guide ""Collect diagnostics.pdf"".     After step 3 in the attached guide where you enabled debug logging and saved the settings.  Please update the polices on the endpoint mac machine and then reproduce the issue before proceeding with step 4 where you collect the diagnostics.   

Please also download the following zip archive 'https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip' and extract the contents into a new folder.   There are two scripts that you can run, for Windows machines please run ""epp_collect_dpi_info.bat"" with administrator privileges.

Hello Manikandan,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We would recommend that you also upgrade the EPP client to the latest version ""v6.2.2.1"" which contains DPI improvements.

In addition to upgrading the EPP client please also turn on ""Peer Certificate Validation"" and ""DPI Bypass"" under ""DPI Configuration"". See below screenshot as example.





You can also add the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Allowlists"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" and then select it also under ""Policy Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"" of an active Content Aware Policy.

Please do let us know if this help to resolve the issue which you are experiencing.

Hi Manikandan,

Yes you can also collect the diagnostics (logs) remotely.  Please follow the instructions on the attached PDF guide ""Collect diagnostics.pdf"".     After step 3 in the attached guide where you enabled debug logging and saved the settings.  Please update the polices on the endpoint mac machine and then reproduce the issue before proceeding with step 4 where you collect the diagnostics.   

Please also download the following zip archive 'https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip' and extract the contents into a new folder.   There are two scripts that you can run, for Windows machines please run ""epp_collect_dpi_info.bat"" with administrator privileges.

Hello Manikandan,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We would recommend that you also upgrade the EPP client to the latest version ""v6.2.2.1"" which contains DPI improvements.

In addition to upgrading the EPP client please also turn on ""Peer Certificate Validation"" and ""DPI Bypass"" under ""DPI Configuration"". See below screenshot as example.





You can also add the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Allowlists"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" and then select it also under ""Policy Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"" of an active Content Aware Policy.

Please do let us know if this help to resolve the issue which you are experiencing.

Hello Manikandan,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

We would recommend that you also upgrade the EPP client to the latest version ""v6.2.2.1"" which contains DPI improvements.

In addition to upgrading the EPP client please also turn on ""Peer Certificate Validation"" and ""DPI Bypass"" under ""DPI Configuration"". See below screenshot as example.





You can also add the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Allowlists"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" and then select it also under ""Policy Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"" of an active Content Aware Policy.

Please do let us know if this help to resolve the issue which you are experiencing.

In addition to upgrading the EPP client please also turn on ""Peer Certificate Validation"" and ""DPI Bypass"" under ""DPI Configuration"". See below screenshot as example.





You can also add the domain 'public.cyber.mil' to the allowed list under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Allowlists"" > ""Deep Packet Inspection"" and then select it also under ""Policy Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"" of an active Content Aware Policy.

Please do let us know if this help to resolve the issue which you are experiencing.


Kind regards
