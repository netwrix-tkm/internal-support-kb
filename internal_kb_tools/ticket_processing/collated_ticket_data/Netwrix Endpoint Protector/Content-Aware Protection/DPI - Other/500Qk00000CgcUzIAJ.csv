We have noticed a large amount of 'DPI Bypassed Traffic' events in our environment and we would like to inquire on more details relating to this event.

I've attempted to look it up on the EPP user manual. Unfortunately, there was no description or details provided.","","","","Answered this question.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","","","3.1","Closed - Resolved","Cobo","Kenneth Lee","2024-07-05T02:14:29.000Z","2024-07-08T04:13:38.000Z"
