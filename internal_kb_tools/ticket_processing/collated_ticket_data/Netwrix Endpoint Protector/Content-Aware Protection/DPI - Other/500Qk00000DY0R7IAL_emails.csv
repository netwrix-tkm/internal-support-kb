Hello Serhat,

I received a cumulative test build for the following issues:
00416233 - EPP writes every ~10 seconds a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory
00416109 - ERR_connection_closed error while accessing websites
00416619 - ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error while accessing websites
00415365 - Browsing issue when DPI is enabled
00414948 - Client DPI Enables support for deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites


Here are the download links for the agents (Windows+Mac):
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0057.zip
Mac: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPMac3.0.3.0024.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if any of the issues can be still reproduced on your environment using the latest test build.

Thank you and Best regards,
Emil

Hello Henrique,

For the case reported for okta.booking.com, we would like to retest it using the test client provided for the ticket #00415365 (Browsing issue when DPI is enabled) for which the download link is available below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp26082024/EPPMac3.0.3.0022.Notarized.tar

Also, let me know if the user is able to access dban.org with the same test build.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Henrique,

As specified in ticket #00416619 ERR_CONNECTION_RESET/Closed errors showing up in case of certificate validation errors is expected behavior when Stealthy DPI is enabled, as based on current design the connection is dropped when encountering a certificate validation error.
Certificate for website dban.org was renewed recently. May we have the confirmation that the user is now able to access it without errors?

Thank you,
Emil

Thank you for your feedback.
I will forward your feedback to the team and I will get back to you with an update.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000DY0R7:ref

Hi  Emil,
Thanks for the update.

Please find my considerations below;

""We saw that you have Peer Certificate Validation enabled (but you have not checked any option under Peer Certificate Validation) and it does not bypass invalid certificates. We saw that DPI bypass is enabled and you bypass all, except for invalid certificates."" 

That is indeed a fact. The whole idea behind it is to perform SSL inspections regardless if the certificate is valid or not, otherwise it would be simple for an attacker to just create a webserver to receive files with an invalid SSL certificate to fully bypass any DLP content scanning.

Ideally once a invalid cert was observed, the ssl inspection would happen normally as EPP should be generating the inspection certificate with the parameters of the original certificate.

 

""You can do any of the following in order to address this issue: 
     -     bypass invalid peer certificates
     -     check ""Ignore Trust"" under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors you have right now should be gone this way
     -     use URL allowlist for destinations that are safe to access (such as okta.booking.com)  ""

 

""     -     bypass invalid peer certificates"" 

As explained, this would create an extremely easy exfiltration channel, and this is not the goal for our DLP implementation.

 

"" -     check ""Ignore Trust"" under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors you have right now should be gone this way""

By Ignoring Trust I, we will be removing one of the most important aspects of SSL, which is to confirm and verify the connection.

Once enabled EPP will issue ""valid"" certificates for ANY cert, and not allowing the browser to alert the user about certificate issues, as also commented before, ideally once a invalid cert was observed, the ssl inspection would happen normally as EPP should be generating the inspection certificate with the parameters of the original certificate.

Here is an example of EPP with the proposed configuration, working as a Proxy to generate valid certs even for certificates that should warn the user:

https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/


 

 

https://self-signed.badssl.com/



 

 

"" -     use URL allowlist for destinations that are safe to access (such as okta.booking.com)  """"

 

The last ""solution"" proposed was already inplace:





 

 

I am willing to have a deeper technical discussion for the proposals which are going to pose as a security risk, and looking for proper secure options.

If EPP can not fulfil Booking.com security requirements, that is also OK, we just need a written confirmation on this ticket, that the product can not be setup in the way we want.

Hello Henrique,

We tried to reproduce the issue, accessing both ""netwrix.okta.com"" & ""dban.org"" and browsed these websites. Obviously, we could not check on okta booking, that's why we tested with netwrix. But we did not encounter any problems when accessing the websites. 

The logs were checked and we could see a lot of errors related to invalid certificates.
We saw that you have Peer Certificate Validation enabled (but you have not checked any option under Peer Certificate Validation) and it does not bypass invalid certificates. We saw that DPI bypass is enabled and you bypass all, except for invalid certificates.

You can do any of the following in order to address this issue: 
     -     bypass invalid peer certificates
     -     check ""Ignore Trust"" under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors you have right now should be gone this way
     -     use URL allowlist for destinations that are safe to access (such as okta.booking.com)  
 
As a side note, related to dban.org. We have checked the certificate of the website and it says this:
Issued On
Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at 6:14:52?PM
Expires On
Monday, November 4, 2024 at 5:14:51?PM

So, the certificate was renewed recently, a week ago. The issue was reported at the end of July (as we can see on the logs, from 26th and 30th of July). It might be that at the time the issue reproduced, the certificate was not valid. But this is just a supposition. 

Please, let me know if any of the suggested options works for you in order to access the websites and not to receive the connection closed errors.

Thank you and Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil, 

The user was browsing dban[.]org website when observed the issue, subsequently any website the user tried to access had the error message.

User was using chrome
