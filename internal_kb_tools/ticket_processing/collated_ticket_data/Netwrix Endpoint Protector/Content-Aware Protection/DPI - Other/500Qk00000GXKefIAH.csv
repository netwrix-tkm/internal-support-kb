"500Qk00000GXKefIAH","00422664","Support Ticket","DPI CA Certificate in Ubuntu","Hello Support Team,

We are piloting Ubuntu endpoints for EPP, and I'd like to understand how DPI CA certificates should be installed in Ubuntu (certificate store)?

We have ""Deep Packet Inspection - Auto-refresh Certificate"" set as ""Manually"". 
For Mac endpoints we  add the DPI certificate to keychain store and trust it as described in the User Manual.
For Windows as far as I understand the agent pulls the CA certificate and automatically trusts it, is this correct?
For Linux, I could not find any information in the EPP documentation. Can you share a document about how to get Ubuntu endpoints ready for DPI enabling?

Also according to the documentation, in Linux, even if the certificate is available and trusted, in the server it is reported as N/A. Why is this, how can we make sure centrally an Ubuntu endpoint certificate is available and trusted for DPI enabling?

Thanks
