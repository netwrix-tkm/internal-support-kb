@WaitingOnEngineer indeed the customer's claim is true. Testing with this website: https://browserleaks.com/tls we can tell that due to DPI, connection to deprecated TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 websites is possible.

We can disable support for deprecated TLS versions from our DPI feature. However, we have to be aware that this will prevent access to websites that use these old TLS versions.

I propose that we remove support for TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 which are deprecated. I will also check which weak cipher suites we should disable.

@WaitingOnEngineer

I did some tests and made sure that Endpoint Protector DPI doesn't enable any more weak cipher suites than a typcal web browser.

Anyway, we will disable all weak cipher suites when we will upgrade the OpenSSL library to version 3.x as part of this task: ESCALATION 342967

As for disabling the weak TLS protocols, I can provide a test-build on request.

As part of request I confirm this test builds cover all 3 Booking requests, based on RN:

Notes

- test build for support using the 5.9.4.0 product update as base
- made from the ""testbuild/#347188-disable-weak-tls"" branch, commit 865d5d4c551
- cherry picked commit: ""update libevent x64"" from branch:
  ""support/ADO-348124_libevent_issues"" for #348124 ""EPP writes every ~10 seconds
  a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory""
What's New
- Disable weak/deprecated TLS protocols TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in DPI. Enabling DPI
  would allow weak TLS protocols, even if the browser of OS disallows them.

I can confirm that now deprecated TLS versions are disabled when DPI is enabled. Good, thanks.

@WaitingOnEngineer we did not touch the enabled cipher suites because we were about to upgrade the OpenSSL library from version 1.1.1w to version 3.0 LTS and that would already remove some deprecated ciphers. We could revisit this with the upgraded OpenSSL library and see if there are any cipher suites that we should remove.

The OpenSSL upgrade is included in the 5.9.4.1 product release. FYI @WaitingOnEngineer

It would be good if we could send a test build to the customer so they can see that some of the deprecated ciphers are removed.

Also, would it be possible to remove all the deprecated ciphers for the client build which will be released in the 5.9.4.1 or 5.9.5.0 server version?
