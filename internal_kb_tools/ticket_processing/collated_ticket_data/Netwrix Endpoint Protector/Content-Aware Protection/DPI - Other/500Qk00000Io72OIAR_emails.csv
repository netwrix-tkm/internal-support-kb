Dear Daniel,

As we have noticed, people were trying to upload PDF files on Outlook, and they were blocked, but the PDF file option was selected in a different policy for social media.

Once we disabled that PDF in the Social Media policy, we noticed that the issue was fixed. Though the issue was fixed, it is ambiguous because the policy is different.

Hence, please reopen the case and please proceed further to rectify.

Thanks!

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Can you please let us know what is ambiguous ? 

In the meeting we have verified and solved the situation, after we removed the pdf extension from the exit points. 

Why this was happening is because you are part of multiple policies, so the EPP searched and analysed them until it reached the policy where the pdf was added as exit point and the policy action was set to block.

Does the situation reappeared after the meeting? 
IS there any other user affected by this? We have checked with another person yesterday and the issue was fixed.

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Daniel,

Please note, that the issue is fixed after unchecking the PDF and no users faced the issue.

The ambiguity is why a PDF file blocked in a different policy is blocking the uploads on the exit points apart from that intended policy created for SM.

Thank you for getting back to us.

As I mentioned in my previous response, when a user is part in multiple policies, the EPP is scanning the file transfer and applies the policy action. 

When you have 10 policies applied, 9 with policy action : Report Only and 1 with Block & Report, when EPP reach that policy ( Block&Report)  the file transfer will be blocked. 

As we demonstrated in the meeting after you removed the exit point the issue was fixed. 

Please let us know if there is anything else that we can assist you with, or we can close this case.

Have a nice day ahead!

Why this was happening is because you are part of multiple policies, so the EPP searched and analysed them until it reached the policy where the pdf was added as exit point and the policy action was set to block.

Does the situation reappeared after the meeting? 
IS there any other user affected by this? We have checked with another person yesterday and the issue was fixed.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

As we have noticed, people were trying to upload PDF files on Outlook, and they were blocked, but the PDF file option was selected in a different policy for social media.

Once we disabled that PDF in the Social Media policy, we noticed that the issue was fixed. Though the issue was fixed, it is ambiguous because the policy is different.

 

Hence, please reopen the case and please proceed further to rectify.

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As I mentioned in my previous response, when a user is part in multiple policies, the EPP is scanning the file transfer and applies the policy action.

When you have 10 policies applied, 9 with policy action : Report Only and 1 with Block & Report, when EPP reach that policy ( Block&Report)  the file transfer will be blocked.

As we demonstrated in the meeting after you removed the exit point the issue was fixed.

Please let us know if there is anything else that we can assist you with, or we can close this case.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note, that the issue is fixed after unchecking the PDF and no users faced the issue.

The ambiguity is why a PDF file blocked in a different policy is blocking the uploads on the exit points apart from that intended policy created for SM.

Thanks!

Dear Daniel,

Firstly, apologies for the confusion. Since, we were testing multiple scenarios I forgot to mention the reason clearly when I asked to reopen the case.

We still have concerns about the way the policy is being applied.

If you remember, for the policy “SM Instagram” the exit points were only browsers and not the Outlook application (E-mail Client). Since the exit points are only browsers and it will block uploads in every website (browsers), this is understood that it is working the way it should be.

But, why the uploads are blocked only on the New Version Outlook Application (Upload allowed on the old Outlook) when the Outlook (E-Mail Client) is not selected? However, this is tested with the test build provided, where it is not blocking the uploads on the New Version Outlook though the exit points are only browsers in the “SM Instagram” policy.

Logically, we consider this to be a bug with the EPP agent (6.2.3.1010).

The concern is that we will create multiple policies depending on our business needs and this kind of bug existing somewhere else (other exit points) should not block us from applying new policies in the future.

Hence, please ensure the same is validated with the test build provided.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As I mentioned in my previous response, when a user is part in multiple policies, the EPP is scanning the file transfer and applies the policy action.

When you have 10 policies applied, 9 with policy action : Report Only and 1 with Block & Report, when EPP reach that policy ( Block&Report)  the file transfer will be blocked.

As we demonstrated in the meeting after you removed the exit point the issue was fixed.

Please let us know if there is anything else that we can assist you with, or we can close this case.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note, that the issue is fixed after unchecking the PDF and no users faced the issue.

The ambiguity is why a PDF file blocked in a different policy is blocking the uploads on the exit points apart from that intended policy created for SM.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Can you please let us know what is ambiguous ?

In the meeting we have verified and solved the situation, after we removed the pdf extension from the exit points.

Why this was happening is because you are part of multiple policies, so the EPP searched and analysed them until it reached the policy where the pdf was added as exit point and the policy action was set to block.

Does the situation reappeared after the meeting?
IS there any other user affected by this? We have checked with another person yesterday and the issue was fixed.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Io72O:ref


Dear Daniel,

As we have noticed, people were trying to upload PDF files on Outlook, and they were blocked, but the PDF file option was selected in a different policy for social media.

Once we disabled that PDF in the Social Media policy, we noticed that the issue was fixed. Though the issue was fixed, it is ambiguous because the policy is different.

Hence, please reopen the case and please proceed further to rectify.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Can you please let us know what is ambiguous ? 

In the meeting we have verified and solved the situation, after we removed the pdf extension from the exit points. 

Why this was happening is because you are part of multiple policies, so the EPP searched and analysed them until it reached the policy where the pdf was added as exit point and the policy action was set to block.

Does the situation reappeared after the meeting? 
IS there any other user affected by this? We have checked with another person yesterday and the issue was fixed.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

As we have noticed, people were trying to upload PDF files on Outlook, and they were blocked, but the PDF file option was selected in a different policy for social media.

Once we disabled that PDF in the Social Media policy, we noticed that the issue was fixed. Though the issue was fixed, it is ambiguous because the policy is different.

 

Hence, please reopen the case and please proceed further to rectify.

 

Thanks!

Dear Daniel,

Firstly, apologies for the confusion. Since, we were testing multiple scenarios I forgot to mention the reason clearly when I asked to reopen the case.

We still have concerns about the way the policy is being applied.

If you remember, for the policy “SM Instagram” the exit points were only browsers and not the Outlook application (E-mail Client). Since the exit points are only browsers and it will block uploads in every website (browsers), this is understood that it is working the way it should be.

But, why the uploads are blocked only on the New Version Outlook Application (Upload allowed on the old Outlook) when the Outlook (E-Mail Client) is not selected? However, this is tested with the test build provided, where it is not blocking the uploads on the New Version Outlook though the exit points are only browsers in the “SM Instagram” policy.

Logically, we consider this to be a bug with the EPP agent (6.2.3.1010).

The concern is that we will create multiple policies depending on our business needs and this kind of bug existing somewhere else (other exit points) should not block us from applying new policies in the future.

Hence, please ensure the same is validated with the test build provided.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As I mentioned in my previous response, when a user is part in multiple policies, the EPP is scanning the file transfer and applies the policy action.

When you have 10 policies applied, 9 with policy action : Report Only and 1 with Block & Report, when EPP reach that policy ( Block&Report)  the file transfer will be blocked.

As we demonstrated in the meeting after you removed the exit point the issue was fixed.

Please let us know if there is anything else that we can assist you with, or we can close this case.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note, that the issue is fixed after unchecking the PDF and no users faced the issue.

The ambiguity is why a PDF file blocked in a different policy is blocking the uploads on the exit points apart from that intended policy created for SM.

Thanks!

Dear Daniel, 
 

Firstly, apologies for the confusion. Since, we were testing multiple scenarios I forgot to mention the reason clearly when I asked to reopen the case.

 

We still have concerns about the way the policy is being applied.

 

If you remember, for the policy “SM Instagram” the exit points were only browsers and not the Outlook application (E-mail Client). Since the exit points are only browsers and it will block uploads in every website (browsers), this is understood that it is working the way it should be. 

 

But, why the uploads are blocked only on the New Version Outlook Application (Upload allowed on the old Outlook) when the Outlook (E-Mail Client) is not selected? However, this is tested with the test build provided, where it is not blocking the uploads on the New Version Outlook though the exit points are only browsers in the “SM Instagram” policy.

 

Logically, we consider this to be a bug with the EPP agent (6.2.3.1010).

 

The concern is that we will create multiple policies depending on our business needs and this kind of bug existing somewhere else (other exit points) should not block us from applying new policies in the future.

 

Hence, please ensure the same is validated with the test build provided.

 

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As I mentioned in my previous response, when a user is part in multiple policies, the EPP is scanning the file transfer and applies the policy action. 

When you have 10 policies applied, 9 with policy action : Report Only and 1 with Block & Report, when EPP reach that policy ( Block&Report)  the file transfer will be blocked. 

As we demonstrated in the meeting after you removed the exit point the issue was fixed. 

Please let us know if there is anything else that we can assist you with, or we can close this case.

Have a nice day ahead! 

Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

Please note, that the issue is fixed after unchecking the PDF and no users faced the issue. 

 

The ambiguity is why a PDF file blocked in a different policy is blocking the uploads on the exit points apart from that intended policy created for SM.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Can you please let us know what is ambiguous ? 

In the meeting we have verified and solved the situation, after we removed the pdf extension from the exit points. 

Why this was happening is because you are part of multiple policies, so the EPP searched and analysed them until it reached the policy where the pdf was added as exit point and the policy action was set to block.

Does the situation reappeared after the meeting? 
IS there any other user affected by this? We have checked with another person yesterday and the issue was fixed.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Io72O:ref

 


Dear Daniel,

As we have noticed, people were trying to upload PDF files on Outlook, and they were blocked, but the PDF file option was selected in a different policy for social media.

Once we disabled that PDF in the Social Media policy, we noticed that the issue was fixed. Though the issue was fixed, it is ambiguous because the policy is different.

 

Hence, please reopen the case and please proceed further to rectify.

 

Thanks!
