"500Qk00000LbGbFIAV","00435056","Support Ticket","Poor performance with EPP Client","Hello,

We recently starting rolling out the Netwrix Endpoint Protector to our employees and we're seeing the EppClient process slowing down workstations...

Most of our staff are software engineers (myself included) and we can see the EppClient spike to using 100~150% CPU when doing disk ""heavy"" operations.
These aren't super disk heavy operations, just fairly standard things with tools like our version control (git) or code editors (VsCode / InteliJ).

Sometimes it's just hogging up CPU, but at other times it also seems to be slowing down the actions we're doing along the way!

Do you have any suggestions on how to reduce this pain?

Are there ways to exclude specific processes, paths, or files from being scanned by Netwrix?

Regards,
