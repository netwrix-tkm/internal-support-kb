@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hello,
We've noticed from the logs that the system has a Kaspersky product installed and it has some sort of DPI feature active.
EPP is not compatible with other DPI-like products.
Please suggest to the customer to disable the Kaspersky DPI feature (traffic scanner/analyzer) or uninstall Kaspersky and try again.

We couldn't find any reference to a previous fix 8 months ago, if the customer can provide any additional information that could help, we would appreciate it.
Also, on the logs provided we can see a Kaspersky service that redirects traffic to itself, it is visible in the firewall rules and in open ports of the ""ksel"" running executable.

That is right yes, yesterday I sent the partner and customer the email below.  There is an old Support case and jira which I found.  Jira link below.

The email I sent to them:

""Hi Sai, Amir, 

Thank you for the reference.  The previous case ID is: 00025680
I have looked at the internal case with our Dev team and don't see that a test build EPP client was provided.  The last correspondence from my colleague was on 17th January with the message below.

""Hi Sattar,

I do have an update for the CAP policy disabling the connection issue.

We've managed to reproduce the issue.
It seems to be an incompatibility in the interaction with KESL (Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux).
KESL has at least a module (Web Threat Protection - WTP) that uses a local proxy to intercept web traffic, a solution similar to EPP DPI.
Unfortunately these WTP and DPI are not compatible.
We are still investigating if we can make them work together, although this might impact functionality.
An option to make DPI work would be to disable KESL WTP. This worked on a standard installation of KESL 12.0.0-6672

As suggested, please try to disable KESL/WTP functionality and let us know how it goes.
As for the DPI/WTP working together, I will revert with updates once there are any recorded.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca""

After the above message we have not received any further feedback / updates on whether disabling KESL/WTP functionality helped to solve the issue.""

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Maybe there is another feature of KESL that needs to proxy traffic through it's process. I see from the screenshot that there is also ""Network Traffic Protection"". The only sure thing I can say is that KESL is acting as a proxy for the traffic, and this is the reason EPP DPI and KESL can not be compatible.
Did the customer try EPP DPI without KESL installed, so we can rule out any problem with EPP?

The customer claims that there are other Linux machines where the issue does not produce even when Network Threat Protection is enabled concurrently with EPP DPI enabled.  They also say that they are not using Web Threat Protection but only Network Threat Protection.  Considering this claim I asked of them to provide us with logs taken from the Linux machines where there are no issues and to take new logs from the Linux machines where the issue produces.  We tried to take this in a remote session yetster4dy but the customer was not prepared.  The Linux machine where the issue does not produce had an older EPP client installed. v2.2.0.60000.  I told the customer that everything needs to be identical between the two Linux machines, the configurations, KESL settings, EPP settings and client versions.

Anyway, they have now submitted logs from one of the affected Linux machines and logs from one of the non-affected machines where the issue does not produce. They claim that both EPP DPI and KESL NTP is enabled on the Linux machine with v2.2.0.6000 installed.

Could it be that the incompatibility between EPP DPI and KESL NTP only started occurring after some changes were implemented in the EPP clients since v2.2.0.60000?

Would it be worthwhile to review these logs and see the possible cause?

I have attached the logs submitted today, they are labeled:
* 2024.10.09 - Affected - Issue Produces.zip
* 2024.10.09 - Not Affected - Issue does not Produce.zip

Please give us your advice regarding this, would it be possible to fix this and make EPP DPI work concurrently with KESL NTP?


This was my email to them yesterday:

Hi Amir,

In the previous case it was stated that WTP was enabled.  Regardless, both WTP and NTP functions the same as both of these features proxy traffic through it's process.  Please follow the steps by collecting logs from the Ubuntu machine that is not producing the issue and from the Ubuntu machine that is producing the issue both of them having EPP DPI enabled and KESL NTP enabled.

This is the last feedback given from our Dev team regarding this matter.

""We can confirm that KESL is acting as a proxy for the traffic, and this is the reason EPP DPI and KESL can not be compatible.  Did the customer try EPP DPI without KESL installed, so we can rule out any problem with EPP?""

These logs are not very helpful.
It would be much more helpful to collect the logs using the Troubleshooting tab of the EPP Notifier. It collects more information about the system.
It would help to compare these extended logs both for the affected and the unaffected machine.

@WaitingOnEngineer

The issue seems to be due to an incompatibility between Kaspersky (some feature(s) that activate a proxy service) and Endpoint Protector's ""Deep Packet Inspection"" feature (that is also based on a proxy service).

There are differences between the unaffected and affected systems. The affected machine has a newer version of Kaspersky installed (12.0), the unaffected machine had (11.3).

We noticed that the Kaspersky product changed its firewall rules between versions, having a dynamically changing products causes a challenge for interoperability also for Endpoint Protector as it can't always keep up with all the changes in conflicting products.

As a workaround we suggest turning off the incompatible features in Kaspersky. We also suggest reaching out to Kaspersky to get their stance on the issue.

We also suggest testing Endpoint Protector without Kaspersky installed, to rule out a problem on our side.

We will continue to try to find a solution on this issue, but we can not guarantee a solution is available from our side.
