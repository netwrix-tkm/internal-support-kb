The costumer has another ticket, but the main point here is to activate DPI to the entire company. When they activate it on the global rights, the servers slows down a lot to the point is not acessible. He suggested a meeting Friday 14h BRT, let me know if you can join or another timeframe close to this.

Best regards,","","When DPI is enabled the EPP Server is using the CPUs at 100%.
After investigations, it seems that there is just one machine who is causing this issue.","The customer is facing some issues when trying to install the new agent.
I asked for a remote session.","The customer had to use a newer EPP Client in order to fix this issue.","Product defect","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","","","267.1","Closed - Resolved","Delta Sucroenergia","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-08-14T12:06:42.000Z","2025-05-08T14:31:57.000Z"
