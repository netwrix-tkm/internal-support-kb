Dear Daniel,

Here what I've done to troubleshoot
I go to Device Control -> Global Settings -> DPI Configuration and make sure ""Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements"" is active.
Then I go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection tab
I add apps.pertamina.com and *.pertamina.com in ""Default DPI Bypass List""
[cid:image001.png@01DBB4F7.94B5DD30]

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now
Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor
Capctha still not appear.
[cid:image002.png@01DBB4F7.94B5DD30]
I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor
Capctha appear.
[cid:image003.png@01DBB4F7.94B5DD30]

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010
Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

I think the client log is gone with the client uninstallation. Can I gather the log from the server?

Dear Daniel,

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.
[cid:image004.png@01DBB5C9.0CD63360]
[cid:image005.png@01DBB5C9.0CD63360]

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.
[cid:image006.png@01DBB5C9.0CD63360]
[cid:image007.png@01DBB5C9.0CD63360]

Also, the support tool is not working.
[cid:image008.png@01DBB5C9.0CD63360]

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

My colleague Daniel is out of office today but I would like to help with this ticket.
As I can see the client 6.2.4.2 is not available in your appliance, I am providing you an offline patch that will inject that version of the client in the server:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz

The offline patch needs to be uploaded under Live Update menu  > Offline Patch  - choose the file downloaded from the link above without extracting the arvhive.
Wait 10 minutes then refresh the entire page - the new client should be available under System Configuration menu.

Dear Daniel,

 

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.





 

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.





 

Also, the support tool is not working.



 

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

 

Best regards,


Robby Sirwaturai

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000OMK2H:ref

 


Dear Daniel,

 

Here what I’ve done to troubleshoot

I go to Device Control -> Global Settings -> DPI Configuration and make sure “Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements” is active.

Then I go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection tab

I add apps.pertamina.com and *.pertamina.com in “Default DPI Bypass List”



 

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now

Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha still not appear. 



I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha appear.



 

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

 

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010

Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

 

I think the client log is gone with the client uninstallation. Can I gather the log from the server?

Robby Sirwaturai

Dear Daniel,

 

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.





 

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.





 

Also, the support tool is not working.



 

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

 

Best regards,


Robby Sirwaturai

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000OMK2H:ref

 


Dear Daniel,

 

Here what I’ve done to troubleshoot

I go to Device Control -> Global Settings -> DPI Configuration and make sure “Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements” is active.

Then I go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection tab

I add apps.pertamina.com and *.pertamina.com in “Default DPI Bypass List”



 

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now

Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha still not appear. 



I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha appear.



 

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

 

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010

Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

 

I think the client log is gone with the client uninstallation. Can I gather the log from the server?

Dear Adrian & Daniel,

I hope you're both doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I'm encountering after installing agent version 6.2.4.2. Unfortunately, the icon does not appear in the system tray, which is quite puzzling.
[cid:image001.png@01DBB929.1A45A090]

Additionally, I've noticed that there is no Cososys folder in the C:Program Files directory. When I attempted to modify the installed application, the same error appeared, which is quite frustrating.
[cid:image002.png@01DBB929.1A45A090]
[cid:image003.png@01DBB929.1A45A090]
I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can offer to resolve this matter. Thank you for your support!

Hi Robby,

My colleague Daniel is out of office today but I would like to help with this ticket.
As I can see the client 6.2.4.2 is not available in your appliance, I am providing you an offline patch that will inject that version of the client in the server:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz

The offline patch needs to be uploaded under Live Update menu  > Offline Patch  - choose the file downloaded from the link above without extracting the arvhive.
Wait 10 minutes then refresh the entire page - the new client should be available under System Configuration menu.

Dear Adrian & Daniel,

 

I hope you're both doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I'm encountering after installing agent version 6.2.4.2. Unfortunately, the icon does not appear in the system tray, which is quite puzzling.



 

Additionally, I've noticed that there is no Cososys folder in the C:Program Files directory. When I attempted to modify the installed application, the same error appeared, which is quite frustrating.





I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can offer to resolve this matter. Thank you for your support!

 

Best regards,

Hi Robby,

My colleague Daniel is out of office today but I would like to help with this ticket.
As I can see the client 6.2.4.2 is not available in your appliance, I am providing you an offline patch that will inject that version of the client in the server:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz

The offline patch needs to be uploaded under Live Update menu  > Offline Patch  - choose the file downloaded from the link above without extracting the arvhive.
Wait 10 minutes then refresh the entire page - the new client should be available under System Configuration menu.

Dear Daniel,

 

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.





 

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.





 

Also, the support tool is not working.



 

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now

Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha still not appear. 



I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha appear.



 

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

 

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010

Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

Dear Adrian & Daniel,

I hope you're both doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I'm encountering after installing agent version 6.2.4.2. Unfortunately, the icon does not appear in the system tray, which is quite puzzling.
[cid:image001.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

Additionally, I've noticed that there is no Cososys folder in the C:Program Files directory. When I attempted to modify the installed application, the same error appeared, which is quite frustrating.
[cid:image002.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]
[cid:image003.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]
I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can offer to resolve this matter. Thank you for your support!

Hi Robby,

My colleague Daniel is out of office today but I would like to help with this ticket.
As I can see the client 6.2.4.2 is not available in your appliance, I am providing you an offline patch that will inject that version of the client in the server:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz

The offline patch needs to be uploaded under Live Update menu  > Offline Patch  - choose the file downloaded from the link above without extracting the arvhive.
Wait 10 minutes then refresh the entire page - the new client should be available under System Configuration menu.


Best regards,

Dear Daniel,

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.
[cid:image004.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]
[cid:image005.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.
[cid:image006.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]
[cid:image007.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

Also, the support tool is not working.
[cid:image008.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000OMK2H:ref


Dear Daniel,

Here what I've done to troubleshoot
I go to Device Control -> Global Settings -> DPI Configuration and make sure ""Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements"" is active.
Then I go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection tab
I add apps.pertamina.com and *.pertamina.com in ""Default DPI Bypass List""
[cid:image009.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now
Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor
Capctha still not appear.
[cid:image010.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]
I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor
Capctha appear.
[cid:image011.png@01DBB9A3.8F5D0F10]

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010
Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

I think the client log is gone with the client uninstallation. Can I gather the log from the server?

Dear Adrian & Daniel,

 

I hope you're both doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I'm encountering after installing agent version 6.2.4.2. Unfortunately, the icon does not appear in the system tray, which is quite puzzling.



 

Additionally, I've noticed that there is no Cososys folder in the C:Program Files directory. When I attempted to modify the installed application, the same error appeared, which is quite frustrating.





I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can offer to resolve this matter. Thank you for your support!

 

Best regards,


Robby Sirwaturai

Hi Robby,

My colleague Daniel is out of office today but I would like to help with this ticket.
As I can see the client 6.2.4.2 is not available in your appliance, I am providing you an offline patch that will inject that version of the client in the server:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz

The offline patch needs to be uploaded under Live Update menu  > Offline Patch  - choose the file downloaded from the link above without extracting the arvhive.
Wait 10 minutes then refresh the entire page - the new client should be available under System Configuration menu.

Dear Daniel,

 

I wanted to give you a quick update on the situation. Unfortunately, the client version 6.2.4.2 is not available on our end. Instead, I proceeded with downloading and installing version 6.2.4.1006. Following a system restart, I noticed that the EPP is not running in the system tray.





 

Moreover, I am unable to modify or repair the installation through Windows Apps, nor can I re-run the MSI installer to repair the EPP.





 

Also, the support tool is not working.



 

Looking forward to your guidance on how to proceed from here.

 

Best regards,


Robby Sirwaturai

Dear Daniel,

 

Here what I’ve done to troubleshoot

I go to Device Control -> Global Settings -> DPI Configuration and make sure “Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirements” is active.

Then I go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection tab

I add apps.pertamina.com and *.pertamina.com in “Default DPI Bypass List”



 

I go to the client to update the agent by right click on the icon located in system tray -> Update Policies Now

Close all browser, wait couple of seconds, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha still not appear. 



I uninstall EPP in affected client, close all browser, open browser and open https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

Capctha appear.



 

The issue is start yesterday. It is the 1st time the user attempting to access https://apps.pertamina.com/ivendor

 

Client: Windows 11 24H2, agent version: 6.2.3.1010

Server: EPP hosted, version: 5.9.4.1

 

I think the client log is gone with the client uninstallation. Can I gather the log from the server?

Robby Sirwaturai
