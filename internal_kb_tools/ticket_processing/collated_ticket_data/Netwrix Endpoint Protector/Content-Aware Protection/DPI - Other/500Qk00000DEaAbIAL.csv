I realized I was not able to browse any website in my browser, tested with Safari, Chrome, Firefox, all same. In the Developer tools in the Network tab it did not even show the request.
In <a href='https://eppsplit.log' target='_blank'>eppsplit.log</a> the error below keeps repeating:
----------------------------------

When we disabled DPI for this agent, the issue was fixed and I was able to browse again.
