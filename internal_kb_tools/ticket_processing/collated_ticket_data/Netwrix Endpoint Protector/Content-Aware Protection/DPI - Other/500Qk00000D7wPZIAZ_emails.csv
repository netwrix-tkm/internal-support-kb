Hi Emil,
Can you please check internally and provide more details about the current
status of the analysis?
Have the engineers had time to review the logs provided ?
Have the engineers successfully reproduced the issue ?
Are the provided logs enough or there is a need for a more detailed report?

The logs and the video should be enough in order to investigate this issue.

Unfortunately, I have no news from the engineers regarding the collected logs or if the issue could be reproduced in our environment yet.

I asked internally for any details regarding the investigation. I will get back to you tomorrow and I will let you know which is the current status of the investigation.

Best regards,
Emil
