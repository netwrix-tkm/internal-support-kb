"500Qk00000MZxF6IAL","00437764","Support Ticket","DPI and Mozilla","Hello! The client wants to integrate DPI feature into EPP. They have noticed that when using the Mozilla browser with DPI enabled, users are unable to access any resources at all. Other browsers are OK.

The issue is that Mozilla is the primary browser in their environment. The question is whether this is expected behavior or if there is a way to bypass or resolve this issue?
Thank you!","","In our remote session today. 
The partner confirmed that the issue with Mozilla Firefox was resolved internally (customer side).
Today we discussed the behavior of Content Aware Protection ""Report Only"" policies with DPI denied lists, we tested and observed that the denied web domains will still be blocked on a Report Only CAP Policy.  As a workaround for visibility of content being transferred you can create a CAP Report Only policy with relevant file types selected, this way the users will still be allowed to send / share documents while these actions are logged under Content Aware Report.

As requested on our call this case will be closed.","The partner requested that case be closed.","Partner requested on our call that this case be closed.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","NONE","","2.1","Closed - Resolved","IPRO SIA","Elena Revzina","2025-03-05T10:54:32.000Z","2025-03-07T12:51:07.000Z"
