Hello Sai,
I am reaching out to seek assistance with a persistent issue we are
encountering. After installing End Point Protector (EPP) on our systems,
internet connectivity is completely disrupted. Despite multiple attempts to
troubleshoot, the problem remains unresolved.

Hi Sai,

My colleague Andre is out today on medical leave, but as we received a feedback from R&D, I would like to share it with you:

The issue seems to be due to an incompatibility between Kaspersky (some feature(s) that activate a proxy service) and Endpoint Protector's ""Deep Packet Inspection"" feature (that is also based on a proxy service).
There are differences between the unaffected and affected systems. The affected machine has a newer version of Kaspersky installed (12.0), the unaffected machine had (11.3).
We noticed that the Kaspersky product changed its firewall rules between versions, having a dynamically changing products causes a challenge for interoperability also for Endpoint Protector as it can't always keep up with all the changes in conflicting products.
As a workaround we suggest turning off the incompatible features in Kaspersky. We also suggest reaching out to Kaspersky to get their stance on the issue.
We also suggest testing Endpoint Protector without Kaspersky installed, to rule out a problem on our side.

Hello Sai,
I am reaching out to seek assistance with a persistent issue we are encountering. After installing End Point Protector (EPP) on our systems, internet connectivity is completely disrupted. Despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot, the problem remains unresolved.

Hi Sai,

Please see the feedback from the developer assigned to your case:

""These logs are not very helpful.  It would be much more helpful to collect the logs using the Troubleshooting tab of the EPP Notifier. It collects more information about the system.  It would help to compare these extended logs both for the affected and the unaffected machine.""

I have also confirmed with our developer, for this particular situation please send us the logs taken from the older client v2.2.0.60000 where the issue does not produce. Also send us the logs from the latest client where the issue does produce so that we can compare the two.

I have attached a step by step guide on how to collect the logs / ""Artifact"" by uploading it from the Endpoint Protector client.  Please see the attached guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.2.pdf""
Please note you will have to wait at least 20-30 minutes before the artifact is able to download from the EPP server.  Attempting to download too soon will give you the error ""File not found. File artifact upload is in progress. Please retry later.""

Hi Sai,

No, this is what the customer claims.  We have been consistent in our feedback to you.  What we are saying is that EPP with DPI and KESL with NTP cannot work together, when both DPI and NTP are enabled they are clashing.  Both DPI and NTP will try to proxy the traffic through it's process, it is like two applications fighting over the control of TCP traffic.  Our Dev team have been saying that the two are not compatible to run concurrently.

The customer claims that EPP with DPI and KESL with NTP works on some Linux machines, if this is true we would like the logs from those machines with the latest EPP client, not with an old EPP client.

I have submitted the customer's feedback with the logs submitted to our Dev team anyway, so I am waiting on their feedback.  But to let you know we only analyze logs with the latest client in order to work on improvements.  But let's wait on a response from our dev team on yesterday's logs.

I hope this is clear now, please let me know if you have any questions or if something is still not clear.

Dear Andre, 

  

According to your statement, the EPP does not cause the issue on Linux machines, am I right? 

Have you tested both affected and non-affected device logs?

Hi Sai,

Thank you for the logs but I would like to point out that the epp client taken from the machine where the issue does not produce is EPP Client v2.2.0.60000, an older client.   We need everything to be identical between the two machines when collecting the logs, the EPP client version, the EPP settings, configurations and policies as well as the KESL NTP configurations.

I have asked our Dev team for their advice regarding the fact that the issue is not produced on the Linux machine with EPP Client v2.2.0.60000.



Kind regards
