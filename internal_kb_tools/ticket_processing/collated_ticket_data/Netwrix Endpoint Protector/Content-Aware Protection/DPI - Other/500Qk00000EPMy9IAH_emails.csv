Engineering did not find anything resembling multiple logs, in fact only one log for the first set of logs, and none for the second set.
This might be a server issue so they asked if this issue is only happening with DPI enabled, or does it also happen with DPI disabled. And is stealthy DPI driver enabled?
It might be worth testing without DPI too, and with and without stealthy DPI when DPI is enabled..
Can these tests be performed? If needed we can set up a remote session to confirm.

Hello Flaviu,

Before continuing, i have a feedback for the way the support tickets are
being handled right now: I understand that this ticket was on another team
member hands, but i keep re-explaining the issue to the engineering every
time we get a new investigation. I think it would be good to have notes
about what is being worked on the ticket to avoid the need of re-doing any
step we already took.
- The issue only happens with the DPI, thats the main point, we need DPI
for the resources the costumer needs.
- The slow slightly improves when we enable the stealth DPI, but i can
still see some lag for a server that has so much resources.

Best regards,

Let me first mention that I completely agree with your assessment and I apologize for how everything is handled. On the bright side of things, we are still improving this and I will forward your complaint and advice to my manager.
I provided the confirmation regarding the DPI status to engineering and will also add the new logs, maybe they show something different this time.

Hello Lucas, 

We will need the customer to enable logging for 2 computers which are reporting lots of events in Reports and Analysis - Content Aware Report.
Once the log files are created, wait for 30 minutes with DPI enabled on the EPP Server side. Since the server will be slowed, I think that 30 minutes is enough time to collect some useful logs.
Then the customer can collect the logs and send them over to us.

Once the logs are collected the DPI can be turned off.


Thank you,
Emil

My colleagues asked me to provide a set of logs in order to identify what is being send by the EPP Clients to the server.
This might not be a server issue, if all the EPP Clients are sending too many false positive logs to the server.

Hello Lucas,

Here is a link from where the customers can download the latest EPP VM:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Prior to the server migration the customers should import the vm and assign it a temporary IP and to update both the appliances to the same version (5.9.3.0 or 5.9.4.0).
Once the servers are both on the same version we can schedule the meeting to migrate the database from one server to another.

Hello Lucas,

If the customer can let us know his availability we can ask to enable DPI starting today so by the time we have the remote session the server will be slow.
This way, the engineer might be able to identify if there is something wrong.

Also a workaround would be to import a new EPP VM and to migrate the database to the new VM.

Thank you Eduard,
 
We appreciate the urgency you are giving to this case.

We are going to wait to hear from the engineering, as fast as possible.

 

Best regards,

Hey Lucas,

Let me first mention that I completely agree with your assessment and I apologize for how everything is handled. On the bright side of things, we are still improving this and I will forward your complaint and advice to my manager.
I provided the confirmation regarding the DPI status to engineering and will also add the new logs, maybe they show something different this time.

Thank you,

Hello Emil,
 

We generated the logs as asked, in attachment.

Hello Lucas, 

We will need the customer to enable logging for 2 computers which are reporting lots of events in Reports and Analysis - Content Aware Report.
Once the log files are created, wait for 30 minutes with DPI enabled on the EPP Server side. Since the server will be slowed, I think that 30 minutes is enough time to collect some useful logs.
Then the customer can collect the logs and send them over to us.

Once the logs are collected the DPI can be turned off.


Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil,
 

Sure, what logs do you need? Can we just let it sit for the entire day? Let me know.

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Can we ask the customer to collect a set of logs from one of the computer while DPI is enabled?
My colleagues asked me to provide a set of logs in order to identify what is being send by the EPP Clients to the server.
This might not be a server issue, if all the EPP Clients are sending too many false positive logs to the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Activating the DPI makes the server slow again. The customer needs to solve this issue ASAP, as the management is already pressuring them.

Hello Lucas,

Here is a link from where the customers can download the latest EPP VM:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Prior to the server migration the customers should import the vm and assign it a temporary IP and to update both the appliances to the same version (5.9.3.0 or 5.9.4.0).
Once the servers are both on the same version we can schedule the meeting to migrate the database from one server to another.

Hello Lucas,

If the customer can let us know his availability we can ask to enable DPI starting today so by the time we have the remote session the server will be slow.
This way, the engineer might be able to identify if there is something wrong.

Also a workaround would be to import a new EPP VM and to migrate the database to the new VM.

Best regards,
Emil

Ok, i will talk to the costumer, but we have any idea on why this is happening? We dont have any evidence on this until now and the costumer is worried about the stability of the solution when DPI is used.

Hey Lucas,

Let me first mention that I completely agree with your assessment and I apologize for how everything is handled. On the bright side of things, we are still improving this and I will forward your complaint and advice to my manager.
I provided the confirmation regarding the DPI status to engineering and will also add the new logs, maybe they show something different this time.

Thank you,

Hello Lucas, 

We will need the customer to enable logging for 2 computers which are reporting lots of events in Reports and Analysis - Content Aware Report.
Once the log files are created, wait for 30 minutes with DPI enabled on the EPP Server side. Since the server will be slowed, I think that 30 minutes is enough time to collect some useful logs.
Then the customer can collect the logs and send them over to us.

Once the logs are collected the DPI can be turned off.


Thank you,
Emil

Hello Lucas,

Can we ask the customer to collect a set of logs from one of the computer while DPI is enabled?
My colleagues asked me to provide a set of logs in order to identify what is being send by the EPP Clients to the server.
This might not be a server issue, if all the EPP Clients are sending too many false positive logs to the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Activating the DPI makes the server slow again. The customer needs to solve this issue ASAP, as the management is already pressuring them.

Hello Emil,

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Here is a link from where the customers can download the latest EPP VM:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Prior to the server migration the customers should import the vm and assign it a temporary IP and to update both the appliances to the same version (5.9.3.0 or 5.9.4.0).
Once the servers are both on the same version we can schedule the meeting to migrate the database from one server to another.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
 

The costumer agreed to a meeting Thursday monday, any time you prefer.

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

If the customer can let us know his availability we can ask to enable DPI starting today so by the time we have the remote session the server will be slow.
This way, the engineer might be able to identify if there is something wrong.

Also a workaround would be to import a new EPP VM and to migrate the database to the new VM.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
 

Ok, i will talk to the costumer, but we have any idea on why this is happening? We dont have any evidence on this until now and the costumer is worried about the stability of the solution when DPI is used.

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Let me know the customer's availability for Thursday or Friday morning in order to investigate this again.
I will try to invite to someone from the devops team to the meeting in order to double check the server's resources and optimizations.

Thank you,

Hey Lucas,

Let me first mention that I completely agree with your assessment and I apologize for how everything is handled. On the bright side of things, we are still improving this and I will forward your complaint and advice to my manager.
I provided the confirmation regarding the DPI status to engineering and will also add the new logs, maybe they show something different this time.

Thank you,

Hello Lucas, 

We will need the customer to enable logging for 2 computers which are reporting lots of events in Reports and Analysis - Content Aware Report.
Once the log files are created, wait for 30 minutes with DPI enabled on the EPP Server side. Since the server will be slowed, I think that 30 minutes is enough time to collect some useful logs.
Then the customer can collect the logs and send them over to us.

Once the logs are collected the DPI can be turned off.


Thank you,
Emil

Hello Lucas,

Can we ask the customer to collect a set of logs from one of the computer while DPI is enabled?
My colleagues asked me to provide a set of logs in order to identify what is being send by the EPP Clients to the server.
This might not be a server issue, if all the EPP Clients are sending too many false positive logs to the server.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil,
 

Activating the DPI makes the server slow again. The customer needs to solve this issue ASAP, as the management is already pressuring them.

 

Best regards,

Hello Emil,
 

We have both server ready with snapshots, can we do this migration tomorrow? maybe 15h BRT or 9h BRT, let me know your availability.

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Here is a link from where the customers can download the latest EPP VM:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

Prior to the server migration the customers should import the vm and assign it a temporary IP and to update both the appliances to the same version (5.9.3.0 or 5.9.4.0).
Once the servers are both on the same version we can schedule the meeting to migrate the database from one server to another.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Lucas,

If the customer can let us know his availability we can ask to enable DPI starting today so by the time we have the remote session the server will be slow.
This way, the engineer might be able to identify if there is something wrong.

Also a workaround would be to import a new EPP VM and to migrate the database to the new VM.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
 

Ok, i will talk to the costumer, but we have any idea on why this is happening? We dont have any evidence on this until now and the costumer is worried about the stability of the solution when DPI is used.

 

Best regards,
