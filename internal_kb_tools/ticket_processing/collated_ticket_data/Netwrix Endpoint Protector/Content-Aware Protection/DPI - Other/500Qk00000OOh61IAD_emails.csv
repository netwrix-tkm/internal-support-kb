I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

We appreciate your patience!

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up with us.

We will wait for your clients response in regards of the replacement.

Also, in regards of the inquiry:


Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.

Thank you for informing me on this one. I will get in it internally to double check and get back to you in regards of the certificate stack.

Hello!

I've sent the clarification question regarding the DPI certificates to the customer in case if it started to be replacing.
Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

We appreciate your patience!

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""
What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.
I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.
As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.
But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:


I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:
 
On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:


	
	Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.
	
	
	VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.
	
	
	Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.
	
	
	Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Server – localhost.
	
	
	Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Provider Type – select App-proxy type.
	
	
	Select the Include All Networks check-box.
	
	
	Provider Designated Requirement
	


anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.


	Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



 




Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""

What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?


Best regards,

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:
[Image_2025-04-29_18-19-43.png]

I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Configuration.htm>

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:


On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:

  *   Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.

  *   VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.

  *   Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.

  *   Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Server – localhost.

  *   Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Provider Type – select App-proxy type.

  *   Select the Include All Networks check-box.

  *   Provider Designated Requirement

anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.

  *   Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""
What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.
I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.
As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.
But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

We appreciate your patience!

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:
[Image_2025-04-29_18-19-43.png]

I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Configuration.htm>

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:


On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:

  *   Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.

  *   VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.

  *   Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.

  *   Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Server – localhost.

  *   Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Provider Type – select App-proxy type.

  *   Select the Include All Networks check-box.

  *   Provider Designated Requirement

anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.

  *   Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



[Image_2025-04-29_18-22-26.png]

[Image_2025-04-29_18-22-34.png]

Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""
What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

We will wait for your clients response in regards of the replacement.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:


I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:
 
On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:


	
	Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.
	
	
	VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.
	
	
	Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.
	
	
	Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Server – localhost.
	
	
	Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Provider Type – select App-proxy type.
	
	
	Select the Include All Networks check-box.
	
	
	Provider Designated Requirement
	


anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.


	Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



 




Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""

What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello!

I've sent the clarification question regarding the DPI certificates to the customer in case if it started to be replacing.
Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

We appreciate your patience!

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""
What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

We appreciate your patience!

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.
I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.
As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.
But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:


I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:
 
On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:


	
	Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.
	
	
	VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.
	
	
	Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.
	
	
	Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Server – localhost.
	
	
	Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Provider Type – select App-proxy type.
	
	
	Select the Include All Networks check-box.
	
	
	Provider Designated Requirement
	


anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.


	Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



 




Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.

Hello!

I have uploaded logs under the ticket on the support portal.
Please confirm if you got this.
Logs were collected with the VPN turn ON.
Also then we tried to enable the Intercept VPN traffic option, but it did not help.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:
[Image_2025-04-29_18-19-43.png]

I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Configuration.htm>

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:


On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:

  *   Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.

  *   VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.

  *   Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.

  *   Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Server – localhost.

  *   Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.

  *   Provider Type – select App-proxy type.

  *   Select the Include All Networks check-box.

  *   Provider Designated Requirement

anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.

  *   Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



[Image_2025-04-29_18-22-26.png]

[Image_2025-04-29_18-22-34.png]

Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""
What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Hello!

I have uploaded logs under the ticket on the support portal.

Please confirm if you got this.

Logs were collected with the VPN turn ON.

Also then we tried to enable the Intercept VPN traffic option, but it did not help.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Would you have some time today at 2 PM EEST for a quick remote session?

If yes, let me know so I can send you the details, otherwise please provide me 2-3 available timeframes for Friday.

Also, in regards of your second inquiry:

And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

We need to use the pem one for deployment as per the official manual but as I understand from the current problem, even the crt one that you have pushed was uploaded to the computers from the office and used but to be sure, when we will test, we will use .pem.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Thank you for the information.
Would it be possible to schedule a remote session with the customer to configure a new JAMF profile by using your best practices?
I think it would be the most accurate way.
And also, please clarify what certificate extension should we use in the profile to be pushed? .pem or .crt?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for following up on this. As I recall during our remote session, the initial deployment of the certificates were done through JAMF:


I've checked  a bit the JAMF documentation that we have:

Creating the Configuration Profile

And it looks like if you are using VPN, there are some configuration settings that need to be adjusted accordingly according to the documentation:
 
On the VPN section, click Configure and then enter the following information:


	
	Connection Name – enter a connection name that will be displayed on the device.
	
	
	VPN Type – select Per-App VPN type.
	
	
	Per-App VPN Connection Type – select Custom SSL connection type.
	
	
	Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Server – localhost.
	
	
	Provider Bundle Identifier – com.cososys.eppclient.daemon.
	
	
	Provider Type – select App-proxy type.
	
	
	Select the Include All Networks check-box.
	
	
	Provider Designated Requirement
	


anchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13] /* exists */ and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = TV3T7A76P4

NOTE: Use the Terminal Editor to verify there are no formatting alterations before executing this command line.


	Select the Prohibit users from disabling on-demand VPN settings check-box.



 




Would you be able to take a look at this and make sure everything is in place and try again on a couple of devices?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello!

Customer provided some tests on two macOS PCs.
They are reporting that behavior is unstable:
""Certificates were replacing only if PC is connected to the corporate network directly (no VPN). When switching to a non-corporate network, certificates are no longer replaced. When I returned to the corporate network, certificate replacement was not enabled again. Last time I had a similar behavior, I waited more than half an hour for it to update the policies, this time even more time has passed and there are no changes.""

What would be our next step?
We should not leave this ticket for to long; it is important to have the EPP client working properly on macOS.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience.

I am following up in regards of the FQDN inquiry:

Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.


It is correct, the FQDN should be the same on the new EPP instance, therefore it should not be changed.
NOTE: Please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).


Let me know if the certificates were deployed over the weekend or over the course of today. If you will still not see any changes, try to redeploy first the DPI certificate.

Looking forward to your resp

Thank you for following up with us.

We will wait for your clients response in regards of the replacement.

Also, in regards of the inquiry:


Also, I would like to confirm that FQDN of the new EPP instance if the same as the previous instant and has the same IP address.

Thank you for informing me on this one. I will get in it internally to double check and get back to you in regards of the certificate stack.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

We have analyzed the case, and we would like to ask if it's possible to allow it at least 24 more hours(or until Monday if you don't work during weekend) until the registration of the certificates could go through accordingly.

If, even after that, for the remote users that are having this issue, we would recommend to try and re-deploy the DPI certificate.

Also, in regards of the other certificates that you have in place from CISCO, we have concluded that they have no part in causing this problem as it could be a simple delay in updating the DPI certs caused by the deployment.

There could also be a possibility that if you have a server certificate stack in place and you regenerate it, the DPI Cert will also need to be changed and the new FQDN of your sever needs to be used. NOTE: This is just a simple heads up to make you aware of this possibility, please do not perform any changes for the server certificate stack yet as this would be a last solution(if applicable).

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I apologize for the late response. I checked the logs and they were received yesterday successfully.

As of right now, I am consulting with a senior on this case to see what could be the cause and what it needs to be done and I will get back to you with a prompt answer.

Hello!

Thank you for your time today.

I've added the logs to a ticket on the support portal, please confirm if you received it.

As we discovered today, if the PC is connected to the corporate internal network - the DPI certificate is replacing fine.

But if the user is working remotely and using the VPN - DPI certificate is not replacing.
