We hope you are doing well.

The blocklist for personal emails and shared drives should normally not cause visible/significant upload speed issues for the end users.

Can you please check to see if DPI(Deep Packet Inspection) is enabled? This may cause a small reduction in upload speed. The reason why this may cause slower upload speeds is that DPI inspects content at a more granular level.

Please let me know if DPI is enabled for the affected end users and if also Intercept VPN Traffic is turned ON or OFF for them.

Hi Flaviu.

We understand the issue, but our users have experienced a significant
decrease in upload speed, as shown in the screenshots below. The problem
occurs not when we activate DPI, but when it is activated together with
certain rules. In these cases, the upload speed dropped from 600 Mbps to
less than 1 Mbps, which caused significant impact to our users.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we have enabled Intercept VPN and after that the Upload speed was normal again. Activating the Intercept VPN Traffic option while Deep Packet Inspection is ON, will intercept the VPN traffic on macOS using the network extension framework.

This setting can be made at a group level for all the users that have that CAP policy enabled.


You may receive a notification to allow the extension in the future, please allow it.

We are closing this ticket.
