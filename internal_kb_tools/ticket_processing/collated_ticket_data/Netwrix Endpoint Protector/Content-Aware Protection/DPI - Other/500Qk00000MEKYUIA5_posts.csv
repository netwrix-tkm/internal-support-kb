Customer name is PrivatBank.
They have encountered the issue when the Destination Details field is empty even if the DPI is turned ON.
The EPP client is Ubuntu 24.04 version 2.4.4.1. When the CAP policy is triggered, the Destination Details field in the Reports and Analysis menu is empty.
Could you please clarify what could cause this issue?
Attaching screenshots.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-24T11:50:39.000Z"
