Please note, that some of our users are not able to upload PDF on outlook and a few other sites (when the DPI is enabled globally).
We also tested few scenarios from our end, but we still feel we are missing something. Hence, I request you to connect on a call tomorrow anytime when you are available.

Our available slots 11:00 AM to 01:00 PM (GMT) and 03:00 PM to 05:00 PM (GMT).

Thanks!","","","","fixed inn 5.9.4.1","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI - Other","","5.9.4.1","22.9","Closed - Resolved","Avrioc Technologies","Naveen Kumar","2024-11-26T13:28:03.000Z","2024-12-19T11:28:34.000Z"
