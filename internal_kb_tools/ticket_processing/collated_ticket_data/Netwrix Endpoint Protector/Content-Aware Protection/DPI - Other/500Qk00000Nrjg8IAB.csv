"500Qk00000Nrjg8IAB","00441472","Support Ticket","Ignore Trust - when checked, certificates will not be validated against the Root Certificate.","We are currently trying to implement the DPI for ourselves. This is active on selected computers. Now the problem is that websites with an invalid certificate (expired, DNS missmatch etc.) are no longer displayed as such. I have deactivated the following options:
Ignore Expiration Date
Ignore Trust
Ignore Hostname

Now I have the problem with the option: Ignore Trust

As soon as this is deactivated, external websites no longer work. Only internal websites can be resolved. 

We would need support here","","The customer is facing some issues when trying to enable DPI for machines.

- Had a call with the customer in which I explained to him how the Ignore Trust option works related to the configuration that they have on their network (they are using Cisco proxy)
- The fact is that when we generate our certificate, we are performing a MITM(Man-In-The-Middle), and we are checking the certificate from the server side, so the one that is showing up in the browser. If they are using another product for this (zscaler, cisco etc) we cannot validate their certificate and that is why the Ignore Trust option has been added, to skip that certificate verification.
As an example, if they are using proxy and this option is not enabled, their internet will not work.","A remote session will be schedule in order to investigate","- Had a call with the customer in which I explained to him how the Ignore Trust option works related to the configuration that they have on their network (they are using Cisco proxy)
