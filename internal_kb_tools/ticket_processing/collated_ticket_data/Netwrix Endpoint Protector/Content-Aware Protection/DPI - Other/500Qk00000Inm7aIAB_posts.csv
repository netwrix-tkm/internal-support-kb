Please note, we wanted to add some of our business domains under the DPI Bypass list and call that dictionary (list) under the allow list in a CAP policy. 

But, when we add the dictionary under the CAP allow list, it is not being saved. When we try editing the policy, we couldn't see that dictionary selected.

This is similar to the other Bug (Email Domain Dictionary) we reported already.

Attaching the recording for your reference.

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-26T09:19:33.000Z"
