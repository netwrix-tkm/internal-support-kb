The Epp agent is not able to block the user from deleting a file.
It can use file tracing to monitor this action.
File Tracing – this feature allows you to monitor data traffic between protected
endpoints and removable devices, internal eSATA HDDs, and Network Shares. It also
shows other actions that took place, such as files named, deleted, accessed,
modified, etc

Kind regards
