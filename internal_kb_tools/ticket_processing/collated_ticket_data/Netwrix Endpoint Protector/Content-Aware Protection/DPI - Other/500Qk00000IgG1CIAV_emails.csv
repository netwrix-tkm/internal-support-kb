Thank you for the details.
I will connect to the server in order to investigate the disk space issue and what is causing it.
I will get back to you with an update as soon as I will discover what is filling up the disk space.

Best regards,
Emil

Currently the disk space of the EPP Server is looking good, I believe that the server should be accessible.
One thing that I noticed on one of the partitions was the presence of an nginx log file, which kept increasing in size. I edited the nginx config and I removed the log file to prevent it from filling up the partition in the future.

Let me know if there is something else that I can help you with regarding this ticket.

Best regards,
Emil
