@WaitingOnEngineer

What is happened exactly when started to NOT work?

(from logs everything works fine and after that something is changed? what was changed?)

From logs a lot of interface up/down event is intercepted.
(more than 350 up/down on interfaces, this is not normal)

Our network extension appears connected in network preferences -> filters?
They uses MDM profile to deployt he mac agents?


If I am not wrong I observed they uses Palo alto and Crowdstrike (this can causes other problems which were mentioned many times, so please don’t mentioned this part
Probably with Palo Alto and EPP together will not work as expected, if multiple network extension are installed, we know about the problems)

If until now worked as expected, what was changed?
After restarts the PC works as expected?

@WaitingOnEngineer we believe the issue is caused by the instability of our network extension for macOS. We are working on a fix, and we will provide a test build soon.

@WaitingOnEngineer

the test build with a fix is available at this location:
_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_08_26/EppMac_v3.0.3.0022


The SSLsplit to the network extension communication relied on a timing assumption (that the network extension had a port to connection info mapping set-up by the time SSLsplit would ask for this information). This assumption was not always true and the situation would cause the network extension to become unresponsive and cause internet outage. The fix makes no timing assumptions and should work all the time.

@WaitingOnEngineer 

Test build: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp26082024/EPPMac3.0.3.0022.Notarized.tar -> it was not yet QA tested, but has been raised to validate proposed solution based on @Robert Zavalczki analyses. 
It shouldn't be mass deployed on production, just on one or few affected machines for observation and confirmation if issue has been resolved.

@WaitingOnEngineer I've just realized that there's a known issue that the network extension version is not changed when doing the builds, so it can happen that if the customer does an upgrade the old macOS network extension will still be loaded.

Usually this is not an issue because the network extension does not change that often.

To be able to properly test this out customer must uninstall the old EPP agent for macOS before installing the test build!
