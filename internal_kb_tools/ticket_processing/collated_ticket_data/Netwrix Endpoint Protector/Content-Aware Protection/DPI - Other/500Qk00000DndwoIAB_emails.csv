Hello Serhat,

I received a cumulative test build for the following issues:
00416233 - EPP writes every ~10 seconds a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory
00416109 - ERR_connection_closed error while accessing websites
00416619 - ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error while accessing websites
00415365 - Browsing issue when DPI is enabled
00414948 - Client DPI Enables support for deprecated TLS versions and weak cipher suites


Here are the download links for the agents (Windows+Mac):
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0057.zip
Mac: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp09092024/EPPMac3.0.3.0024.Notarized.tar

Please let me know if any of the issues can be still reproduced on your environment using the latest test build.

Thank you and Best regards,
Emil

Hello Serhat,

As Robert clarified during Monday's meeting ERR_CONNECTION_RESET/Closed errors showing up in case of certificate validation errors is expected behavior when Stealthy DPI is enabled as based on current design the connection is dropped when encountering a certificate validation error.
If users should be allowed to access websites presenting certificate errors ""Bypass Invalid Peer Certificates"" option under DPI Bypass would help here continue their work while Content Aware Report will specify the bypassed websites.
May we have the confirmation that as certificate for website kayak.pl was updated recently, the user is able to access both kayak.pl and kayak.nl?

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Emil,
Similar to the discussion in ticket: 416109

The recommended workaround (""Ignore Trust"" option) will decrease the security of the user and trust chain in the TLS.

Is this issue considered as a bug that you are going to address in the lates releases?

Thanks,
