@WaitingOnEngineer 

I've tried to reproduce the issue, accessed both ""netwrix.okta.com"" & ""dban.org"" and browsed these websites. Obviously I could not log on okta booking, that's why I tested with netwrix. I did not encounter any problems. 

I checked the logs. I see a lot of errors related to invalid certificates. I see that the customer has Peer Certificate Validation enabled (and doesn't ignore any option under Peer Certificate Validation) and it does not bypass invalid certificates. I see that DPI bypass is enabled and they bypass all, except for invalid certificates. They can do any of the following: 

	 - 	bypass invalid peer certificates
 
	 - 	check Ignore Trust under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors they have right now should be gone
 
	 - 	use URL whitelist for destinations that are safe to whitelist (such as okta.booking.com)  
 
As a side note, related to dban.org. I have checked right now, the certificate of that site. It says this:

Issued On
Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at 6:14:52 PM

Expires On
Monday, November 4, 2024 at 5:14:51 PM


So, the certificate was renewed recently, a week ago. The issue was reported at the end of July (I see logs from 26th and 30th of July). It might be that at the time the issue reproduced, the certificate was not valid. This is just a supposition.

"00aQk000008WPDBIA4","500Qk00000DY0R7IAL","Hello,

Booking got back to us with the following:

""Please find my considerations below;

""We saw that you have Peer Certificate Validation enabled (but you have not checked any option under Peer Certificate Validation) and it does not bypass invalid certificates. We saw that DPI bypass is enabled and you bypass all, except for invalid certificates."" 
That is indeed a fact. The whole idea behind it is to perform SSL inspections regardless if the certificate is valid or not, otherwise it would be simple for an attacker to just create a webserver to receive files with an invalid SSL certificate to fully bypass any DLP content scanning.
Ideally once a invalid cert was observed, the ssl inspection would happen normally as EPP should be generating the inspection certificate with the parameters of the original certificate.

""You can do any of the following in order to address this issue: 
     -     bypass invalid peer certificates
     -     check ""Ignore Trust"" under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors you have right now should be gone this way
     -     use URL allowlist for destinations that are safe to access (such as okta.booking.com)  ""

""     -     bypass invalid peer certificates"" 
As explained, this would create an extremely easy exfiltration channel, and this is not the goal for our DLP implementation.

"" -     check ""Ignore Trust"" under Peer Certificate Validation. Most of the certificate related errors you have right now should be gone this way""
By Ignoring Trust I, we will be removing one of the most important aspects of SSL, which is to confirm and verify the connection.
Once enabled EPP will issue ""valid"" certificates for ANY cert, and not allowing the browser to alert the user about certificate issues, as also commented before, ideally once a invalid cert was observed, the ssl inspection would happen normally as EPP should be generating the inspection certificate with the parameters of the original certificate.
Here is an example of EPP with the proposed configuration, working as a Proxy to generate valid certs even for certificates that should warn the user:
https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/




https://self-signed.badssl.com/



"" -     use URL allowlist for destinations that are safe to access (such as okta.booking.com)  """"

The last ""solution"" proposed was already inplace:





I am willing to have a deeper technical discussion for the proposals which are going to pose as a security risk, and looking for proper secure options.
If EPP can not fulfil Booking.com security requirements, that is also OK, we just need a written confirmation on this ticket, that the product can not be setup in the way we want.""


They are not pleased with the proposed solutions..

Let me know if there is something we can do about these issues that the customers are facing, or if further investigations are needed in order to help them.
