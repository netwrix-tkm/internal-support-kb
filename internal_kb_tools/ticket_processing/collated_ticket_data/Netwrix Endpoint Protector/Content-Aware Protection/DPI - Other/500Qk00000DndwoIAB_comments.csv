@WaitingOnEngineer 

The issue does not reproduce on our side, I checked in Chrome and Edge also. I see in the logs that kayak.pl is not working because of an untrusted certificate. It is really strange that, according to the settings, this should be bypassed and it should work. Anyway, I see that the website had the certificate changed recently, so can we ask the customer to test one more time? And get a new set of logs if the issue still reproduces. 

At the same time, as a workaround if it still doesn't work, the customer can try two different approaches. One is to whitelist entirely kayak.pl. Or to have Peer certificate validation enabled, but to check also the ""Ignore Trust"" option. Either way I expect this to work. 

If new logs are collected, please make sure they collect them without the above workarounds in place. Thanks!

The customer got back to me and asked the following :
""The recommended workaround (""Ignore Trust"" option) will decrease the security of the user and trust chain in the TLS.
Is this issue considered as a bug that you are going to address in the lates releases?""
What should I tell to the customer, as this might not be an actual issue.

@WaitingOnEngineer as response to their feedback:



""The recommended workaround (""Ignore Trust"" option) will decrease the security of the user and trust chain in the TLS. Is this issue considered as a bug that you are going to address in the latest releases?""



we should tell them that:


They are correct and indeed they should not check ""Ignore Trust"" in the ""Peer Certificate Validation"" settings. 


The ERR_CONNECTION_RESET error they received for the kayak.pl website was because briefly (for a few days) the certificate of that website was expired. This is a known and expected behavior when Stealthy DPI is used. The connection is dropped when encountering a certificate validation error.


Alternatively, if they don't care about scanning network traffic to websites with invalid certificates they can use the ""DPI Bypass"" option with the ""Bypass Invalid Peer Certificates"" checked. In this case their browser's policy will take care of handling the invalid certificate. They will also get reports in Endpoint Protector about the bypassed websites.
