@WaitingOnEngineer , 

Please use the following link to download a test build with Windows native OCR (which should have better performance):
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp29012025/EPPClient_v6.2.4.0054.zip

Additionally, you might want to test with DPI disabled for Outlook (on the ""Deep Packet Inspection"" server settings page) and with the add-in enabled.

Thank you for the test build.

After asking the customer to add the process ""Outlook"" to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"", they reported that now they are rarely facing outlook slowness issue while ocr is scanning in outlook.

Would you still like the customer to test with the build with Outlook removed from advanced system scanning?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-06T07:52:46.000Z","2025-02-06T07:52:46.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Andre,

If the customer is happy with his current solution, I don't see any reason to use the test build, unless any other issues arise with the OCR.
Thanks,
Iuri
