Customer name is PrivatBank.
They are testing the Print blocking CAP policy.
If they try to print, for example confidential file just from C: drive, it's successfully blocking by CAP.
But if they open this document in the Browser, for example Google Docs or just in the Browser contextual menu, this file goes to the printer with no block.
Would it be possible to block files printing from Browser with EPP?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-31T09:39:21.000Z"
