Thank you for reaching out to us.
Please check if the MTP Advanced Scanning and Printing is enabled under Global Settings. If not, please activate it, Save and then restart the PC as this feature requires a service restart in order to work.
Let us know if afterward the File traces events appear.

Best regards,
Alin Anca

Hello,
Thank you for your response. We enabled the suggested feature, are there any other changes that need to be made for the printed files to be traced properly. And also regarding restart, should we restart the server or the client where the print is expected to happen?

Thank you for your reply.
You would need to restart the target computer in order for the changes to take place.
Please let us know the result after that.

Have a nice day,

Hello,
The print tracing is working now, but we have one more question. What different ways does EPP support to dynamically export data to third party tools, such as SNMP or Syslog?

Thank you for your reply.
We have a SIEM integration section available in the UI that sends Syslog type logs towards an external configurable service.
For more informations about this, please see the section in the user manual for SIEM integration, I will add it also below:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/Appliance/Overview.htm#siem_integration

As you confirmed that the query for which you raised the current ticket is resolved, I will close this ticket now and ask you if additional queries arise, to please raise a new ticket.

Have a nice day,
