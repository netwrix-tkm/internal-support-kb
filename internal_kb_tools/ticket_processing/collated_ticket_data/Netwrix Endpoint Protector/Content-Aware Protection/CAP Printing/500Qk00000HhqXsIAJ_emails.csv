Hello,

It seems like extension works. CAP  blocked print work from the browser.
Did you have chance to clarify if it is possible to block print job for the Linux and MacOS PC as well?


Best regards,

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As specified in our User Manual:

  *   Block Print from Browsers – Enable this setting to prevent users from printing web pages from any supported browser on Windows.

NOTE: The Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature is available only for Chrome and Edge via a dedicated extension. For other browsers, this setting will block print functionality.

  *   Block Print if CAP Cannot Process File – This setting determines the action if CAP cannot access the file content. By default, printing is allowed. This option applies only to Chrome and Edge with the browser extension on Windows.

Regarding the network printers, could you please provide us a set of logs from the affected machine?

Looking forward for your response

Best regards,

Meanwhile, customer shared a kind of bug in the report section, attaching a screenshot.
If they try to print a file with Network printer and CAP Remediation policy type, in CAP report the Destination Type first shows like ""Network Printer"" and after Remediation was canceled the Destination Type is ""Local Printers"" for some reason.

Could you please clarify about the CAP browser extension to make a CAP work with browser print?
How to install and use it? If you have a link to instruction from the manual, please send it.
Also, if this feature is Windows only, is it possible to block print from browser for Linux and MacOS?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As specified in our User Manual:

  *   Block Print from Browsers – Enable this setting to prevent users from printing web pages from any supported browser on Windows.

NOTE: The Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature is available only for Chrome and Edge via a dedicated extension. For other browsers, this setting will block print functionality.

  *   Block Print if CAP Cannot Process File – This setting determines the action if CAP cannot access the file content. By default, printing is allowed. This option applies only to Chrome and Edge with the browser extension on Windows.

Regarding the network printers, could you please provide us a set of logs from the affected machine?

Looking forward for your response

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HhqXs:ref

Hello,

Thank you for your recommendation, we proposed customer to enable these settings.
Will it just block all the print from browser or just confidential files?
Also, if this feature is Windows only, is it possible to block print from browser for Linux and MacOS?

Meanwhile, customer shared a kind of bug in the report section, attaching a screenshot.
If they try to print a file with Network printer and CAP Remediation policy type, in CAP report the Destination Type first shows like ""Network Printer"" and after Remediation was canceled the Destination Type is ""Local Printers"" for some reason.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for reaching out!

In the Device Control menu, under the Global Settings, you will have an option that will need to be enabled block print from browsers.

Also, please enable the Advanced printers option and then save.

Please restart the endpoint where you want to test, then let us know if the printing from browser is working.

Looking forward for your response.

It seems like extension works. CAP  blocked print work from the browser.


Did you have chance to clarify if it is possible to block print job for the Linux and MacOS PC as well?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HhqXs:ref

Hello,

Thank you for your recommendation, we proposed customer to enable these settings.
Will it just block all the print from browser or just confidential files?
Also, if this feature is Windows only, is it possible to block print from browser for Linux and MacOS?

Meanwhile, customer shared a kind of bug in the report section, attaching a screenshot.
If they try to print a file with Network printer and CAP Remediation policy type, in CAP report the Destination Type first shows like ""Network Printer"" and after Remediation was canceled the Destination Type is ""Local Printers"" for some reason.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We do not have any workaround for this situation, since for the Linux and MacOS is a technical limitation.

We can proceed with the closure of this case and open a new case in which we can submit this as a feature request for the other OSs . 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello,

So, currently it is not possible to control the print job sent from the browser for Linux and MacOS endpoints, right?
Could you please give some recommendations for the customer how to workaround this?

Hello,

It seems like extension works. CAP  blocked print work from the browser.


Did you have chance to clarify if it is possible to block print job for the Linux and MacOS PC as well?

Hello,

Thank you.

Could you please clarify about the CAP browser extension to make a CAP work with browser print?


How to install and use it? If you have a link to instruction from the manual, please send it.

Also, if this feature is Windows only, is it possible to block print from browser for Linux and MacOS?

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for getting back to us.

As specified in our User Manual: 

	
	Block Print from Browsers – Enable this setting to prevent users from printing web pages from any supported browser on Windows.

	NOTE: The Content-Aware Protection (CAP) feature is available only for Chrome and Edge via a dedicated extension. For other browsers, this setting will block print functionality.
	
	
	Block Print if CAP Cannot Process File – This setting determines the action if CAP cannot access the file content. By default, printing is allowed. This option applies only to Chrome and Edge with the browser extension on Windows.
	

Regarding the network printers, could you please provide us a set of logs from the affected machine? 

Looking forward for your response
