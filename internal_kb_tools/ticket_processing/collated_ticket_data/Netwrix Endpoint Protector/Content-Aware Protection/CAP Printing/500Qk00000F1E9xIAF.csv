We have a user unable to print out Outlook contents to network printers or print to PDF file, but email attachment is ok. I checked the CAP logs and found the jobs have blocked by a policy ""Browser Policy"", but we don't have the policy and she is the only user got the issue. Please help to check.

Thanks

Tony Hsieh","","","","Closing as resolved after applying the following workaround.

Workaround:
- add to the exception the “Outlook” process (this means the Outlook will NOT be detoured, so the user will be able to print the files).
System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions -> “Outlook” (add to content) -> check the process (generate)","","Zachary Roy","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Printing","","","7.8","Closed - Resolved","CTBC Bank Corp.
