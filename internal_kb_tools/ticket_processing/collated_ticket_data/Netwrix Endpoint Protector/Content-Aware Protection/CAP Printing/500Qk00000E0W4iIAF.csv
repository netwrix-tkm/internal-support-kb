since we updated EPP to the newest version (Server 5.9.4.0 and Client 6.2.3.1010) we have the problem, that we can't print via Outlook anymore. It just blocks it. 
Via all other programs it is still possible to print smth. 
I just reinstalled the previous client version (6.2.2.2005) and it worked again.
So there must be a bug in the new version?
How long does such a fix take?

After trying to print it states the following In the console under ""Content Aware Report"":
Event: Content Threat Blocked
Source: Outlook -> //
Destination Type: Network Printers
File Size: 0.00B
Justification: N/A

Under log details it says:
