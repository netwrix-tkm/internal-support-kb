Starting from 594 a new functionality was implemented to monitor/scan printing from Outlook.

This new functionality is automatically applied if:
1. there is a CAP policy with Outlook exit point
2. the printing is checked in CAP policy
3. MTP/detour is enabled for computer



Workaround:

- add to exception the “Outlook” process (this means the outlook will NOT be detoured, so the user will be able to print the files).

System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions -> “Outlook” (add to content) -> check the process  (generate)


To respond also for questions:

1. Up to version 6.2.2.2005, printing from Outlook worked without the corresponding Outlook AddIn.

So the AddIn has only been required since the latest version.

2. What is the Outlook AddIn actually good for? So what does the AddIn do in general?


No, it is not required to install the add-on.
If the customer doesn’t want to monitor the email subject, body and recipients list, it is not necessary.
This add-on is helpful when DPI is NOT enabled (or in other situations where the DPI cannot extract these informations)


3. If the functionality is not a bug, but intended, then we now have to install the Outlook AddIn on all clients in the company.

Is there a way to reinstall the AddIn without completely uninstalling EPP and then reinstalling it with the new AddIn?

Please use the latest build with the mentioned workaround.
If the customer uses any MDM to install/run scripts in mass, we can deliver a script/executable to install the add-on.
