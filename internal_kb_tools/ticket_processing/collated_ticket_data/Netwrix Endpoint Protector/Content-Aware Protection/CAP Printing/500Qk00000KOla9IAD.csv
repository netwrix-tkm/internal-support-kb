"500Qk00000KOla9IAD","00431542","Support Ticket","Print block not working for image files, OCR taking more time to scan files","1.OCR sacnning not detecting the images properly
2.OCR scanning takes too long to scan the mail and its delaying the process even if it is validate content.
3.Kindly do connect on remote to check on this issue","","""India1 Payments Limited"" was having an issue where EPP OCR in MS Outlook is causing ""Not responding"" for a few seconds when they attach images to an email that is being composed.
We had a remotes session to observe this behavior however it seems like it could be the EPP MS Outlook Ad-in that is causing lag and performance Issues on MS Outlook.
We tested a scenario where we uploaded images via the web browser and observed that EPP OCR immediately detects the sensitive content and EPP then blocks the upload without delay however
when the images are being uploaded to MS Outlook email then the notification ""OCR scanning pops up and either stays there indefinitely or it shows for 10+ seconds, when this happens then the user needs to click on ""Send"" a few more times before the email is sent.
In the event that the image being uploaded contains sensitive information then the customer needs to wait for the ""Not responding"" message to go away and then they need to click more than twice on the send button before EPP blocks the email.

We tested without the Ad-in and the issue does not produce, also without the Ad-in no CAP Policies are enforced.

The issue seems mostly related to the MS Outlook Ad-in as a whole as opposed to only EPP OCR.


After asking the customer to add the process ""Outlook"" to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"", they reported that now they are rarely facing outlook slowness issue while ocr is scanning in outlook.

Would you still like the customer to test with the build with Outlook removed from advanced system scanning?","Feedback of better performance after asking the customer to add the process ""Outlook"" to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"" relayed to R&D","After asking the customer to add the process ""Outlook"" to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"", they reported that now they are rarely facing outlook slowness issue while ocr is scanning in outlook.","","Andre Le Roux","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Printing","NONE","","28.0","Closed - Resolved","India1 Payments Limited","Lokesh N","2025-01-09T07:01:39.000Z","2025-02-06T08:05:21.000Z"
