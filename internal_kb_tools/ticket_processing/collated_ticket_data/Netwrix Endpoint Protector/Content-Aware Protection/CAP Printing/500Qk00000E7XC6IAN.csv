"500Qk00000E7XC6IAN","00417392","Support Ticket","""Print"" function blocked","Hello,

We performed the Netwrix Endpoint Protector server 5.9.4.0 update and client 6.2.3.1010 update. After these updates it is no longer possible to print e-mails from Microsoft Outlook. We receive the following notification ""The print action was blocked for Microsoft Outlook"", no extra configuration was made and all the CAP policies are set to ""Report only"". Could you please provide a fix/solution for this problem?

Kind regards,
Rudolfs","","","","The customer confirmed that the workaround of adding the Outlook process name under Advance printers MTP scanning exceptions fixed the situation and we can close this ticket.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Printing","","5940","21.9","Closed - Resolved","Squalio","Rudolfs Bauers","2024-08-07T12:20:10.000Z","2024-08-29T11:02:05.000Z"
