Thank you for contacting us.
Please make sure you enabled File Shadowing for CAP from Device Control > Computer Settings, as seen here :


If you are using the default internal file shadow repository, then please note it's not recommended to enable File Shadowing globally, only for small groups of computers. An alternative is to configure an external file shadow repository.
Since you are using your dev/ test server then it's safe to test.
Let us know the results. If you encounter any issue we can schedule a remote session using Zoom.
