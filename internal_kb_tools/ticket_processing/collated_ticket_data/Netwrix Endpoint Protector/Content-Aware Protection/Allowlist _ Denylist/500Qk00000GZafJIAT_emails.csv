Hi Tony,

Please let me know if we can schedule a remote session for this week, or next week so we can test again with the affected end user and generate some logs, while using the new EPP clients.

We would need access to the end user's computer that is affected by this.

Please turn “Use Stealthy DPI Driver” on for a few computers that experience the issue after installing the new EPP agent.

Hi Tony,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

They have prepared a client build for this.

Please test this build on a few computers(it is the 5941 release build) and see if the issue persists. If you would like we can schedule a remote session in order to test this together next week. Please also try to turn on Stealth DPI from Device Control -> Computer -> Manage Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection before testing.

Please let us know the outcome.

We will wait to see if the issue reproduces itself again. We have generated appended log files and this should catch the behavior.

Please let me know if the issue comes back and we will try to schedule another remote session then and reproduce it, or gather the logs that we generated.

Hi Tony,

Please let me know if we can schedule a remote session for this week, or next week so we can test again with the affected end user and generate some logs, while using the new EPP clients.

We would need access to the end user's computer that is affected by this.

Hi Tony,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

They have prepared a client build for this.

Please test this build on a few computers(it is the 5941 release build) and see if the issue persists. If you would like we can schedule a remote session in order to test this together next week. Please also try to turn on Stealth DPI from Device Control -> Computer -> Manage Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection before testing.

Please let us know the outcome.

Hi Tony,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we added 1 more item to the email domain Allowlist and removed + re-added it to the policy.

We will wait to see if the issue reproduces itself again. We have generated appended log files and this should catch the behavior.

Please let me know if the issue comes back and we will try to schedule another remote session then and reproduce it, or gather the logs that we generated.

Hi Tony,

Please let me know if we can schedule a remote session for this week, or next week so we can test again with the affected end user and generate some logs, while using the new EPP clients.

We would need access to the end user's computer that is affected by this.

Hi Flaviu,

 

Apology for the delay, as it was end of the year, users are very busy for yearend reports, I am checking with users for available time. I will update to you next week.

Hi Tony,

Please turn “Use Stealthy DPI Driver” on for a few computers that experience the issue after installing the new EPP agent.

Please let us know if the issue still persists afterwards for those computers.

Hi Flaviu,

 

The Deep Packet Inspection is on by default, please advise if “Use Stealthy DPI Driver” needs to be turned on.

Hi Tony,

We have just received an update from our colleagues.

They have prepared a client build for this.

Please test this build on a few computers(it is the 5941 release build) and see if the issue persists. If you would like we can schedule a remote session in order to test this together next week. Please also try to turn on Stealth DPI from Device Control -> Computer -> Manage Settings -> Deep Packet Inspection before testing.

Please let us know the outcome.

Hi Flaviu.

Please help to check if any update on the issue, we would like to deploy the policies as soon as possible, but don't want to impact the daily businesses.

Thanks
