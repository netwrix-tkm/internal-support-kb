"500Qk00000NwSmgIAF","00441704","Support Ticket","In Whatsapp App file blocking not working properly at the time of POC it was working fine.","In Whatsapp app when we are trying to block excel and Documents files they are not getting block but blocking  .exe file type  is working fine.","","Connected remote with Vikas to take a look at the issue.

Seems like he had a problem with uploading XSLX and DOCX documents through WhatsApp desktop, even though the CAP policy was properly adjusted to block those file types and as exit points he selected both WhatsApp apps.

Also for entities he selected the computer properly as he had computer only as higherarchy.

After some tests, I figured the problem was with MTP scanning that was disabled and asked him to restart and concluded that was the actual problem which was not enabled.

After doing that and testing again, the files were blocked successfully.
Agreed to close the case.","Closing ticket as resolved.","Issue solved after enabling the MTP Scanning.","","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","NONE","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Bright Life Care Limited","Vikas Kataria","2025-04-11T07:49:14.000Z","2025-04-11T13:07:28.000Z"
