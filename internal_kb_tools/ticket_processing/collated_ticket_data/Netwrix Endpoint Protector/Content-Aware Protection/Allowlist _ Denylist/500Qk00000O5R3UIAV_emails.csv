I would like to request a Zoom meeting for 30 min. I want to go over the
www.facebook.com spam. I've noticed if I visit forkable, sometimes on our
CAP logs it triggers www.facebook.com and sometimes it does not. We also
fixed our contextual detection rule last week with Flaviu with an update.
Now the contextual list is not applying anymore today and we are getting
false positives again.
