@WaitingOnEngineer I cannot reproduce this on my end using the latest client version. Could you please test on clients' end with 5.9.4.1 corresponding client release?

Also, I can see in the logs that DPI is enabled (but without the stealthy setting), but the eppsslsplit.log log file in attachment folder is empty. Would you please share that log file also?
