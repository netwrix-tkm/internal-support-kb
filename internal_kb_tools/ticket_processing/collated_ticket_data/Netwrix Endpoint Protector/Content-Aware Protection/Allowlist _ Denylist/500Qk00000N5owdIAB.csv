Thank you for your time on our call today.  We were able to resolve the issue by adding the Amazon aws S3 domain to the DPI domain / URL allowed list, after adding the domain the user tested to see if their uploads were allowed and confirmed that it was working.  As agreed on our call this case will be closed.
