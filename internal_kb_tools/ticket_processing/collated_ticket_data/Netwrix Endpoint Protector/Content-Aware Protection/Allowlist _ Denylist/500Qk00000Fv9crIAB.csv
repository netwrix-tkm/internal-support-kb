We have added several potentially malicious domain names to our denylist. However, one of the domains is a 302 redirect, and we noticed that the client can still access the blocked domain and obtain the redirect link.

Could you explain how the EPP handles blocking domains on the denylist? From my understanding, the EPP client should prevent access to the blocked domain entirely, without retrieving the redirect link.","","","","Closed - By Client","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","NONE","","112.9","Closed - Resolved","Cobo","Kenneth Lee","2024-09-18T09:52:28.000Z","2025-01-09T07:51:40.000Z"
