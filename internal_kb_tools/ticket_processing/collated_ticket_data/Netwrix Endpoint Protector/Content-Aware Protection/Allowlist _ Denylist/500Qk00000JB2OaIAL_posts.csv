We are currently conducting a Proof of Concept (PoC) with our customer, who has outlined the following requirements:
- Block passowrd-protected/encrypted PDF files from being sent through all exit points.
- Prevent confidential and highly confidential classified files (using metadata) from being sent to external domains, while allowing them within the internal domain via the Outlook desktop application.

For the first requirement, we have set up the CAP policy with the following configuration:
Action: Block & Report
Exit point : Web Application, Email Application
Policy Denylist: File type -> Office2003+/Password
Result: Password-protected PDF files are not being blocked. 

For the second requirement, we configured the CAP Policy as follows:
Action: Block & Report
Exit point : Web Application, Email Application -> Outlook (Attachment)
Policy Denylist: Custom Content -> Classification (~HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL~)
Policy Allowlist: E-mail Domain -> internal (<a href='https://ctbcbank.co.id' target='_blank'>ctbcbank.co.id</a>)
When a classified file is sent to an internal domain recipient, the activity is blocked, and the destination details in the event is logged as: /o=ctbc/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=01e46e33b86941cab9bb1603f4a6baba-Adiprastowo Rustama

Could you please advise on how we can:
- Effectively block password-protected or encrypted PDF files transfer.
- Add the recipient as logged format to the e-mail allowlis to prevent internal classified file trasnsfer from being blocked.

Thank you.
