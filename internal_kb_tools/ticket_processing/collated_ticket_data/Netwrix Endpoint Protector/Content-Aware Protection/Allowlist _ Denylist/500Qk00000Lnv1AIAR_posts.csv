It has been working well without VPN, but if I connect to work VPN I start to have trouble when on the internet and receive ERR_Failing etc. messages. The VPN is set to not block stuff, and works fine normally. But when I turn on the Content Aware Policy, the deny-list I made starts blocking and I can't visit additional sites as well.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-12T17:00:14.000Z"

During the remote session, we enabled the DPI Smart Logging for Ismail's Mac and the issues seemed to be resolved, but after a computer reboot, all the websites, and the Zoom app were blocked.

We have sent the necessary steps for collecting the epp client logs.","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2025-02-12T21:40:32.000Z"
