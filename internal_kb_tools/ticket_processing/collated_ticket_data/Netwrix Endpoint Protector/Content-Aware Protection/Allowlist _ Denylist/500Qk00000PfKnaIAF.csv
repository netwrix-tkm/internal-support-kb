Client needs to allow specific mails to upload and block other mails and also wants to create custom alerts.

Connected remote with Sabeesh to take a  look at the case.
He wants to prevent users from accessing other domains than their business one using GMAIL.
Advised on how to use the CAP->DPI Allowed business accounts option and added their domain there.
We tested afterwards on a machine and it was blocking other domains without a problem.
Closing ticket.","28/05/2025
