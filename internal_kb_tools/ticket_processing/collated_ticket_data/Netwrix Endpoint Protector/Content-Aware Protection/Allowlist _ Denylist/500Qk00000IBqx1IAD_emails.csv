Hello Andre,
Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted “Exchange Administrator Group “ as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.
This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,
That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China.
We can discuss with the logs we see in the console.

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,
Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted ""Exchange Administrator Group "" as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.
This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China.

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,
Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted ""Exchange Administrator Group "" as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.
This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Hello Andre,

That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China. 

We can discuss with the logs we see in the console.

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,

Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted “Exchange Administrator Group “ as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.

This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Dear Sudipa,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Could you please confirm under which allowlist did you add the email domains?, were they added to ""Deep Packet Inspection"" or under ""E-mail Domain""?





Can you also confirm if ""Deep Packet Inspection"" is enabled please?  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".


Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for your time on our call today.  Today we tested the scenario on your machine and we were not able to reproduce the issue, Endpoint Protector worked as expected.

As discussed on our call, because the artifact does not download from the EPP Server appliance you have the option to collect the logs manually from the affected user's machine.

Could you please use the Support Tool to collect the logs and then upload it to the Netwrix support portal please?
Please follow the step by step guide in the attached ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf""

Dear Sudipa,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Could you please confirm under which allowlist did you add the email domains?, were they added to ""Deep Packet Inspection"" or under ""E-mail Domain""?





Can you also confirm if ""Deep Packet Inspection"" is enabled please?  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".


Looking forward to your response.

Hi Sudipa,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  Today we tested the scenario on your machine and we were not able to reproduce the issue, Endpoint Protector worked as expected.

As discussed on our call, because the artifact does not download from the EPP Server appliance you have the option to collect the logs manually from the affected user's machine.

Could you please use the Support Tool to collect the logs and then upload it to the Netwrix support portal please?
Please follow the step by step guide in the attached ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf""


Kind regards

Hi Sudipa,

Sure we can check the configurations on the EPP Server and when a user would be available we can schedule a call for that time.
The bridge on Zoom is open, will you join?

That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China.
We can discuss with the logs we see in the console.

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,
Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted “Exchange Administrator Group “ as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.
This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Hello Andre,

That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China. 

We can discuss with the logs we see in the console. 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,

Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted “Exchange Administrator Group “ as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.

This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Dear Sudipa,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Could you please confirm under which allowlist did you add the email domains?, were they added to ""Deep Packet Inspection"" or under ""E-mail Domain""?





Can you also confirm if ""Deep Packet Inspection"" is enabled please?  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".


Looking forward to your response.

Hi Sudipa,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  Today we tested the scenario on your machine and we were not able to reproduce the issue, Endpoint Protector worked as expected.

As discussed on our call, because the artifact does not download from the EPP Server appliance you have the option to collect the logs manually from the affected user's machine.

Could you please use the Support Tool to collect the logs and then upload it to the Netwrix support portal please?
Please follow the step by step guide in the attached ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf""


Kind regards

Hi Sudipa,

Sure we can check the configurations on the EPP Server and when a user would be available we can schedule a call for that time.
The bridge on Zoom is open, will you join?

Hi Sudipa,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  Today we tested the scenario on your machine and we were not able to reproduce the issue, Endpoint Protector worked as expected.

As discussed on our call, because the artifact does not download from the EPP Server appliance you have the option to collect the logs manually from the affected user's machine.

Could you please use the Support Tool to collect the logs and then upload it to the Netwrix support portal please?
Please follow the step by step guide in the attached ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf""


Kind regards

Hi Sudipa,

Sure we can check the configurations on the EPP Server and when a user would be available we can schedule a call for that time.
The bridge on Zoom is open, will you join?

Hello Andre,

That time works for me. But please note the users will not be there that time as they are from China. 

We can discuss with the logs we see in the console.

Hi Sudipa,

Can we look at this issue via a remote session tomorrow at 3 PM Amsterdam time?  I have pre-booked this slot and sent you the calendar invitation.  If this time does not suite you then please let me know so that we can re-schedule for an appropriate time.  We would need to have at least one affected user who will be able to reproduce the issue in the remote session.

Hello Andre,

Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted “Exchange Administrator Group “ as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.

This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Hi Sudipa,

Thank you for your time on our call today.  Today we tested the scenario on your machine and we were not able to reproduce the issue, Endpoint Protector worked as expected.

As discussed on our call, because the artifact does not download from the EPP Server appliance you have the option to collect the logs manually from the affected user's machine.

Could you please use the Support Tool to collect the logs and then upload it to the Netwrix support portal please?
Please follow the step by step guide in the attached ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf""


Kind regards

Hi Sudipa,

Sure we can check the configurations on the EPP Server and when a user would be available we can schedule a call for that time.
The bridge on Zoom is open, will you join?

Hello Andre,
Yes, all the domains are added in the email domains. These has happened quite sometime now in different users. We had previously whitelisted ""Exchange Administrator Group "" as well as it was getting picked as OU in CAP policy.
This time I saw Ou=External which is very strange to me.

Dear Sudipa,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Could you please confirm under which allowlist did you add the email domains?, were they added to ""Deep Packet Inspection"" or under ""E-mail Domain""?


[cid:image003.png@01DB3AA8.626710C0]


Can you also confirm if ""Deep Packet Inspection"" is enabled please?  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".


Looking forward to your response.

Dear Sudipa,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

Could you please confirm under which allowlist did you add the email domains?, were they added to ""Deep Packet Inspection"" or under ""E-mail Domain""?





Can you also confirm if ""Deep Packet Inspection"" is enabled please?  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".


Looking forward to your response.


Kind regards

The case is currently with our R&D team to review the logs.  I will inform you the moment I received feedback. 
In the meanwhile, I would recommend that you upgrade the EPP clients to the latest version which was released with Endpoint Protector 5.9.4.0, currently there is a small mismatch as the EPP clients currently installed ( v6.2.2.1006 ) are from Endpoint Protector Server version 5.9.3.0.
To ensure optimum performance please aligned the EPP Client version to the EPP Server version.

Please follow below steps to upgrade your Endpoint Protector clients to the latest software version currently available on your server:

	Click on ""System Configuration"" > ""Client Software Upgrade"".



 

	Select the computers that you wish to upgrade (Instead of selecting all, select about 100) and then click on ""Next""




 

	Confirm the upgrade job and click on ""Start Upgrade Job""




Could you give the above steps a try and let us know if the upgrade process was successful and also if another incident occurred on EPP Client version 6.2.3.1010 please?



Kind regards
