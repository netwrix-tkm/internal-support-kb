I created a feature request a long time ago - before the switch to the netwrix portal.
I am not sure if this feature request has ""survived"" the transission to Netwrix.
Therefore I would like to ask what the status of this feature request is?
Attached you will find my mail from May 2024.

Thank you in advance!","","Customer had a few questions regarding a case that they raised a couple of months ago.","We provided them the requested details.","Customer required details regarding a feature request","","Daniel Anton","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","3.2","Closed - Resolved","Geislinger GmbH","Panagiotis Dragatis","2025-02-28T10:50:04.000Z","2025-03-03T15:39:34.000Z"
