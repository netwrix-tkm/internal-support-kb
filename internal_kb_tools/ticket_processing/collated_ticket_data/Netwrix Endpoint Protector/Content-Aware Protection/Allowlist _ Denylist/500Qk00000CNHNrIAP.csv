One of our clients has blocked .dwg files in the Denylist section. However, they need to send a .dwg file via email to a specific domain. We have added the domain to the Allowlist section, but the file is still being blocked. According to the logs, the blockage is due to the ""Blocked File"" rule, but there is no policy named ""Blocked File"" in Content Aware Protection.

Best Regards.","","","","solved, by adding the file extension to the policy denylist.","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","3.8","Closed - Resolved","Laykon Distributor","Yağız Özkütük","2024-06-27T13:08:35.000Z","2024-07-01T07:36:41.000Z"
