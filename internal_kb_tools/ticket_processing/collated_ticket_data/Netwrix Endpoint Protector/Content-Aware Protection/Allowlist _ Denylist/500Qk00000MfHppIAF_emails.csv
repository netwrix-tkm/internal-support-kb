Ticket Number: 00438023
Ticket Subject: False positive URL blocking report
Ticket Details: Good afternoon,

Customer name is RubyPlay.
They faced a problem with a false positive URL blocking.
In the Content Aware Report (CAP) menu, we can see that URL was blocked, but it is not included in the URL Denylist.
Content Aware Report (CAP) shows that the policy was triggered on the URL: <a href='https://tunnel.googlezip.net' target='_blank'>tunnel.googlezip.net</a>, but it is not in the Denylists as you could see in the screenshots.
Screenshots are attached.

Thank you!

Botond Biro
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Nadiia,

I believe it could be a false positive, or one of the denied URLs was blocked and showed up incorrectly in the logs.
Is the customer using the latest server and client version?
Please also confirm this is happening on Windows.
