"500Qk00000DXTLWIA5","00416088","Support Ticket","Domain Allowlist for CAP doesn't appear to be working","We have a single allowlist containing the following URLs
*<a href='.schemeswriter.co.uk' target='_blank'>.schemeswriter.co.uk</a>
https://*<a href='.schemeswriter.co.uk' target='_blank'>.schemeswriter.co.uk</a>
<a href='https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk' target='_blank'>https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk</a>

We have added (ticked) this list in the Policy Allowlists > Deep Packet Inspection section of our only policy.
We have updated our clients to use this new policy.

When uploading a file to <a href='https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk/some/path' target='_blank'>https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk/some/path</a> we are still blocked from uploading it.

We would like to allow a set of sub-domains dictated by https://*<a href='.schemeswriter.co.uk' target='_blank'>.schemeswriter.co.uk</a> but this does not seem to work at all.

What are we doing wrong?","","DPI allowlist does not work as expected.","A remote session will be scheduled in order to further investigate.","Customer asked to close the ticket for the moment as this is not something important for them.
They will reopen the ticket when if needed.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","169.2","Closed - Resolved","Brokertech","Michael Smith","2024-07-25T13:21:35.000Z","2025-01-10T18:06:42.000Z"
