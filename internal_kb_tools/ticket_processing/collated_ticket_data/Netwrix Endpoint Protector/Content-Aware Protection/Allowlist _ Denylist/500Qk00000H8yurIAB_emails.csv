Hello Vipin,

Thank you for getting back to us.

To block the youtube.com for a single user , you will have to create a new policy to apply it to that specific user.

Once that policy is created, please go to the Denylist and under the Domain and URL, please add a new entry, add the name and in the content please add *.youtube.com

Return to the policy and in the policy denylist, go to the domain and url submenu and add the dictionary created.

Save and update the policies on the user machine.

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Vipin,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

To block the youtube.com for a single user , you will have to create a new policy to apply it to that specific user. 

Once that policy is created, please go to the Denylist and under the Domain and URL, please add a new entry, add the name and in the content please add *.youtube.com 

Return to the policy and in the policy denylist, go to the domain and url submenu and add the dictionary created.

Save and update the policies on the user machine. 

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Vipin,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

To block the youtube.com for a single user , you will have to create a new policy to apply it to that specific user. 

Once that policy is created, please go to the Denylist and under the Domain and URL, please add a new entry, add the name and in the content please add *.youtube.com 

Return to the policy and in the policy denylist, go to the domain and url submenu and add the dictionary created.

Dear Danial,

 

Thanks for sharing the procedure. I have followed this and  it is successful.

 

Could you please help me also to block desktop WhatsApp application. 

 

WhatsApp is blocked in web browser, but some users have installed the WhatsApp desktop app from Microsoft app store.  So please help for this case.

 

Screenshot is attached for your reference.

Hello Vipin,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

To block the youtube.com for a single user , you will have to create a new policy to apply it to that specific user. 

Once that policy is created, please go to the Denylist and under the Domain and URL, please add a new entry, add the name and in the content please add *.youtube.com 

Return to the policy and in the policy denylist, go to the domain and url submenu and add the dictionary created.

Save and update the policies on the user machine. 

Please check and let us know the outcome.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
