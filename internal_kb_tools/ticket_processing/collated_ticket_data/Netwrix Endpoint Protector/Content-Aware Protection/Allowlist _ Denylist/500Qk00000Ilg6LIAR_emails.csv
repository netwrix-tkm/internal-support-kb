Thanks for reaching out!
This bug will be fixed in the next release of EPP Server.
The current workaround is to re-check all desired ""Allowed Files"" and/or ""Deep Packet Inspection"" components before clicking the SAVE option. By doing so, these components will be included in the edited CAP policy.
