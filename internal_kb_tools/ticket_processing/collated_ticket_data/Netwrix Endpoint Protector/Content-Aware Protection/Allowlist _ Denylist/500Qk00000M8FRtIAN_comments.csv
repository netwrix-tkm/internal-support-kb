@WaitingOnEngineer

We will probably need some more details for this case. And more tests as well. Before redeploying the EPP client, Zoom and other apps were working fine? Does this issue happen on multiple machines or only one? The eppsslsplit.log file doesn't tell anything, it looks like traffic monitoring did not really start. Did you try to uninstall, restart the machine and manually install the client? Maybe test the same scenario with EPP client uninstalled. Or with DPI disabled. I would also enable Intercept VPN software and try again. Any mention about other products that might interfere with the EPP client? Maybe get a set of extended DPI logs, if you conclude that enabling DPI triggers the issue.
