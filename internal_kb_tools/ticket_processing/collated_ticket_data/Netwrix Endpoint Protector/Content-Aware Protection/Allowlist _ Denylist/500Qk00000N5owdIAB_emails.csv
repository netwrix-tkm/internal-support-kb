Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

Can you connect in a remote session now?


I noticed that you have set the severity for this ticket to ""Critical"", we will ask you to please consider using the ""Priority"" and ""Severity"" status appropriately so that we can correctly prioritize support tickets.  We only use ""Critical"" severity for critical issues and critical impacts on business like ""Server down"" or where multiple users are unable to connect or use their computers.  Critical Severity status applies where production within the business is severely affected for multiple users.

I have changed the severity from ""Critical"" to ""High"".



Kind regards

Thank you for your time on our call today.  We were able to resolve the issue by adding the Amazon aws S3 domain to the DPI domain / URL allowed list, after adding the domain the user tested to see if their uploads were allowed and confirmed that it was working.  As agreed on our call this case will be closed. 

After a ticket has been closed it can be reopened within 30 days after closure in case there are any updates from your side. If no update is received within 30 days after closure then a new ticket will need to be opened where you can use the previous ticket number as a reference.


Kind regards
