@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hi, Boti, 

This is still under investigation. In the meantime, besides the attached printscreens, could you please provide some logs for when the case is reproducing (along with the reprovision.db file). If the customer has DPI set to ON, could you attacht the DPI logs, too?


Thank you!

I have generated a new set of logs with Debug Mode to capture the issue. 
Issue: when setting policies with low thresholds uploads get picked up in emails that are not sent and have 0 kb. These are logged and create a lot of noise on the customers side.

The computer is a Terminal Server on which we collected the logs.

Hi Flaviu, 

I have conducted some more tests trying to figure out why this is happening. On my side this case is not reproducing. I have managed to simulate generating the logs by removing the AppData path from our default ignored paths in EPP. In that situation, a lot of logs are generated when the Outlook application is started. However, only in this way I cannot say for real that the case is reproducing. 

This might be related to the fact that there are more users on the Terminal Server. I am preparing a test build with some additional logs in order to try and figure out what is the exact cause for this. I will return when the build is ready. 

Thank you for the patience!

Hi,

I have prepared a test build. It contains some additional logs to better understand what the location allow list contains and what locations are ignored. The build is located at: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_09_11EPPClient_v6.2.3.0062

Please use this test build in order to reproduce the issue and then provide the log files. 

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan can you please provide a download link for this build?

Thank you!

Hello,

I managed to take a more detailed look into this issue. There are two aspects that have to be considered here. 

First, the way in which the whitelisted locations will not work for the blocked Outlook temp files. In order to whitelist the files and subfolders in that location, be sure that you set the location as follows (with a * at the end): C:Users*AppDataLocalTemp*DiagnosticsOUTLOOK* 

Secondly, I have prepared a test build with a fix for the way in which we manage the whitelisted file locations. The Outlook temp files cannot be opened by EPP at the first try as Outlook also accesses them. This makes EPP follow another flow in order to open those files. On this second flow, the files are however scanned and blocked. 


The test build containing the fix is located at: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_10_24EPPClient_v6.2.4.0014

@WaitingOnEngineer  please make sure that you do add the location to the whitelist as mentioned above, and then retest with the build provided. 

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan could you please provide a download link for this test build? 

Thank you!
