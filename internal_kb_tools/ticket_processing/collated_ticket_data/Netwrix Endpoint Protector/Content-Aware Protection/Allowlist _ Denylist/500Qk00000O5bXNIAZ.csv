I've been having this issue where I enable a CAP policy, but (for example) I need to send a mail and said mailo won't be sent because of the CAP policy. I've tried to configure an allowlist for this to be solved but I haven't been able to, so I would appreciate some help in this regard.","","We have sent the customer our documentation for the email domain allowlist and asked if they need further assistance.

We had a remote session for investigating the reported issue, and informed the customer on how to collect the logs from the affected computer.

We received the logs from the customer, and will follow up with T2

We found in the collected logs that an email address was not included in the E-mail Domain Allowlist, and that caused the e-mail to be blocked by EPP.","We are waiting for the customer's answer.
