Thank you for checking in. We’ve been reviewing the details and I will have an update for you soon.

Question, how many users require to use this API call to dropbox.com? Is there a way you could add these users to another policy which allows them to visit dropbox.com while leaving other policy for others who do not run this API call?

I will let you know as soon as I get an update from my DevOps team. 

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Thank you for reaching out. Our DevOps team reviewed your inquiry regarding blocking specific URL paths. Currently, our product can only block access based on the domain (e.g., www.dropbox.com) rather than the entire URL path (e.g., www.dropbox.com/login).

If you need finer-grained control to include blocking specific paths, we invite you to submit a feature request. Our team will review it and consider adding that functionality in a future update.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
