We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.","","","","005Qk000002lX5pIAE","2025-02-04T17:11:56.000Z"

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade. 
Asked customer if they still wanted to perform the upgrade today

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade. 
Asked customer if they still wanted to perform the upgrade today

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade. 
Asked customer if they still wanted to perform the upgrade today

- Downloaded the Endpoint Protector 5.8.1.0 virtual appliance from the designated website, establishing the base for server setup.

- Created a virtual machine using VMware with the OVF files from Action Plan step 1, initiating the configuration of the new server. A snapshot was created for rollback protection.

- Sequentially updated the appliance to EPP 5.9.2.0. A post-update snapshot was taken for version stability.

- Successfully performed a backup and database dump of the old server, which was at version 5.9.2.0, ensuring data preservation for migration.

- Transferred the backup/dump to the new server. The import process took considerable time due to the 60 GB database size, but it was successfully concluded.

- Updated the new EPP server to EPP 5.9.4.1. After changing the new server's IP to match the old one, connectivity with client computers was thoroughly verified.

- Customer took a final snapshot of the fully updated and operational EPP server to secure current configurations and settings.

- Customer requested further assistance in a new policy creation and assisted customer to enable DPI settings

- Customer requested further assistance in getting test machine EPP add-on installed on outlook

- Scheduled a remote session for 3/20/2025 at 8 AM CST to assist customer in adding add-on to Outlook

2/4/2025:

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade. 
Asked customer if they still wanted to perform the upgrade today

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade.
