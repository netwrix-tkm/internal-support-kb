"500Qk00000KXIvXIAX","00431828","Support Ticket","Request for Assistance: Issue with Content Aware Protection Policy and Default File Allowlist","I hope this email finds you well.

We are currently encountering an issue with the Content Aware Protection policy. Specifically, when we edit or modify the policy, the Default File Allowlist is not being accepted as expected. Consequently, this is leading to false positive logs being generated for files that have already been whitelisted or allowed.

We would appreciate it if you could arrange a call to review this issue in detail and provide us with a suitable solution at the earliest.","Issue not reproducible in 5.9.4.1 server version.","This was happening in 5940, but in 5941 this doesn't happen anymore.
After going in the CAP policy, adding the Allowlists and Saving, after a refresh or Log Out, the Allowlist remained as previously saved - works correctly.","Ronak and his colleague will monitor for the next few days if the issue is still present and after that get back to us.","We recreated the Allowlist, and add it again to CAP policy.","Product defect","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","53.0","Closed - Resolved","Catchpoint India","Indu Shekhar","2025-01-13T11:14:03.000Z","2025-03-07T11:31:44.000Z"
