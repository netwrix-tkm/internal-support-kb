Hi Ismail,

I have attached the Jamf and Intune deployment guides also here: 
- JAMF: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm
- Microsoft Intune: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/Intune/Overview.htm

If these guides didn't help you fix the deployment issue(the server IP not being set properly), please raise a separate support ticket, so we can track different issues individually.

Thank you!

Hi Iosif,
 

Also, last time we spoke, I mentioned how we are trying to push the Netwrix EPP agent for our employees through Hexnode. I mentioned we are able to install the agent on a device, but they do not pop up on EPP Console, I don't see their device. You mentioned I press: Command + Option + I, on the settings tab and I see 10.10.16.145:443. I asked the guy that his is not working right, and his shows NOT SET (attached in screen shot). I was wondering if you could help me troubleshoot this issue. I am free from 10:30am-12pm PST today Tuesday, February 18th. I am also free from 1pm PST and afterwards. On Wednesday, I am free anytime.

Regards,

Ismail Reyhanoglu

Hi Ismail,

Iosif is out of office today but will return on Monday and get back to you.
Until then, we cannot state a specific time for engineering to reply as it is based on priorities and the backlog. Rest assured that once we have an update we will let you know.

I wanted to follow up on how long I should expect to wait until I hear back from sending over the logs, so we can have another meeting to try to fix the issue. Thanks,

Here you go. When I turned on the content aware policy, zoom sign in did not work right away. Gmail does, but after a few minutes, it went down too. Google search worked after Gmail went down, but a few minutes later, it went down too. After I turned off the VPN and captured the logs, my internet doesn't load anymore so I restart my Macbook. Thank you for the help!

Hi Ismail, 

Thank you for the remote session.

Here is a summary of what we did in today's meeting:
- we have enabled the Smart DPI logging for your Mac -> Gmail started working
- after a reboot all the websites were blocked, even the Zoom app

Please use the following steps to collect the logs:

1. Open the terminal
2. use the following commands to create the log files:

	sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
	sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

3. Reproduce the issue
4. After the issue is reproduced, copy the log files to the Desktop using the commands:

	cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
	cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

5. Sent us the files (attach them to this ticket)

For the MDM solutions we have the following guides:

I solved this, u can close this ticket. The only thing i noticed is if the
user isnt connected to vpn which connects to EPP server, once or twice the
denylist stops applying even tho it was received from a previous policy
from last time it was connected, and i thought the latest policy recieved
supposed to remain even if it loses connection. it worked again once i
reconnected. but besides that, it has been working smooth

I solved this, u can close this ticket. The only thing i noticed is if the user isnt connected to vpn which connects to EPP server, once or twice the denylist stops applying even tho it was received from a previous policy from last time it was connected, and i thought the latest policy recieved supposed to remain even if it loses connection. it worked again once i reconnected. but besides that, it has been working smooth

Hi Ismail,

I have attached the Jamf and Intune deployment guides also here: 
- JAMF: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm
- Microsoft Intune: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/Intune/Overview.htm

If these guides didn't help you fix the deployment issue(the server IP not being set properly), please raise a separate support ticket, so we can track different issues individually.

Thank you!

Hi Iosif,
 

Also, last time we spoke, I mentioned how we are trying to push the Netwrix EPP agent for our employees through Hexnode. I mentioned we are able to install the agent on a device, but they do not pop up on EPP Console, I don't see their device. You mentioned I press: Command + Option + I, on the settings tab and I see 10.10.16.145:443. I asked the guy that his is not working right, and his shows NOT SET (attached in screen shot). I was wondering if you could help me troubleshoot this issue. I am free from 10:30am-12pm PST today Tuesday, February 18th. I am also free from 1pm PST and afterwards. On Wednesday, I am free anytime.

Regards,

Ismail Reyhanoglu

Until then, we cannot state a specific time for engineering to reply as it is based on priorities and the backlog. Rest assured that once we have an update we will let you know.

Hi Team,
 

I wanted to follow up on how long I should expect to wait until I hear back from sending over the logs, so we can have another meeting to try to fix the issue. Thanks,

Here you go. When I turned on the content aware policy, zoom sign in did not work right away. Gmail does, but after a few minutes, it went down too. Google search worked after Gmail went down, but a few minutes later, it went down too. After I turned off the VPN and captured the logs, my internet doesn't load anymore so I restart my Macbook. Thank you for the help!

Hi Ismail, 

Thank you for the remote session.

Here is a summary of what we did in today's meeting:
- we have enabled the Smart DPI logging for your Mac -> Gmail started working
- after a reboot all the websites were blocked, even the Zoom app

Please use the following steps to collect the logs:

1. Open the terminal
2. use the following commands to create the log files:

	sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
	sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
	sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

3. Reproduce the issue
4. After the issue is reproduced, copy the log files to the Desktop using the commands:

	cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
	cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
	cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

5. Sent us the files (attach them to this ticket)

For the MDM solutions we have the following guides:
- JAMF: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm
