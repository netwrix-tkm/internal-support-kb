Hi Adrian,

Details are like . We have created two different policies in our DLP one is
for allowed few tasks and the other is for restrict .
The Restrict is one the default and when we are moving any device from
restrict to the allowed list it shows the device moved but the policy is
still not applying.
Users are not able to do the tasks as per the allowed policy. Which is
blocking their daily work. Earlier this was working fine and it is working
for a few users on which we had applied this earlier. but suddenly stopped
working on any new device we are adding to the same group. This is quite
unusual as we haven't made any changes in policies. Please help us in
resolving this issue







Kind Regards,
Ashish Sharma

Thank you for your time on our call earlier today.  After amending your Content Aware Policy on our call today, please let me know if the issue which you experienced with print screen being blocked is now resolved.

You raised the following questions.

	How does Endpoint Protector recognize and detect the PII in documents, based on what information / algorithm does Endpoint Protector have this ability.
	What are the actions that could trigger ""Forced Uninstall Attempt"" and ""Uninstall Attempt""

I will get back to you soon with feedback.

Hi Adrian,

 

Details are like . We have created two different policies in our DLP one is for allowed few tasks and the other is for restrict .

The Restrict is one the default and when we are moving any device from restrict to the allowed list it shows the device moved but the policy is still not applying.
Users are not able to do the tasks as per the allowed policy. Which is blocking their daily work. Earlier this was working fine and it is working for a few users on which we had applied this earlier. but suddenly stopped working on any new device we are adding to the same group. This is quite unusual as we haven't made any changes in policies. Please help us in resolving this issue
