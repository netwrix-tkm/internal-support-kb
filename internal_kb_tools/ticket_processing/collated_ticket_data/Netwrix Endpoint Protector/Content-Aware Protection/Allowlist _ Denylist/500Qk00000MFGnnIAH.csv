"500Qk00000MFGnnIAH","00436791","Support Ticket","False Positive Issue","Hi Team,

I worked with a member of support at the beginning this month to address a false positive my users were receiving. We had set up the website <a href='https://segaldev.crm.dynamics.com' target='_blank'>segaldev.crm.dynamics.com</a>* to be on the allow list. Despite that, they are still getting these notifications. Can you advise how we can fix this on our instance please?","","We have scheduled a remote session for tomorrow(25.02.2025 22:30 RO time)

During today's meeting, we discussed the CAP - Deep Packet Inspection (Policy Allowlist) and Regular Expression(Policy Denylist) - where and how to use them.

The customer reopened the ticket and we scheduled a remote session in which we added more options to the Allowlist dictionary and also performed an EPP server upgrade + started the EPP client software upgrade job.","Investigate the issue during the remote session.","During today's meeting, we discussed the CAP - Deep Packet Inspection (Policy Allowlist) and Regular Expression(Policy Denylist) - where and how to use them.
