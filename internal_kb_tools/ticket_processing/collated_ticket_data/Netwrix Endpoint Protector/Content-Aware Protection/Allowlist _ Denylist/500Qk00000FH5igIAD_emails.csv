Hi Flavio,

I believe it is ok to close. When the visual fix comes out for the November deploy as you mentioned, I will confirm that as well.


Thank you.

Hi Ebenezer,

I believe the two are related as the Admin Action page reads from the CAP policy.

We should have a fix for this in the upcoming EPP server version 5.9.4.1. This is currently aimed for November this year.

Hi Flavio,

I was out of office when some of your earlier emails came in. From reports I searched, the DPI allowlists seem to be working. The visual bug issue is however not only on the CAP policy allowlist page, the admin actions page only indicate a policy was edited but does not show the specific change that took place.

Thanks.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

The issue with these allowlist dictionaries is that they don't remain checked when selected on the CAP page. It is not visible in the user interface, but you can find this information on the admin action page.
Based on this issue that the dictionaries are not remaining checked in the UI, we need to mention:

If you need to modify any information, you must always check ""Allowlist Files"" and/or ""Deep Packend Inspection"" for the Policy Allowlist.

If these dictionaries are not selected each time, they will not be included in the policy.

If you checked these dictionaries, the UI will remain the same(no selection), but you can verify on the Admin Action page if the policy reflects your preferences.

This is a visual bug that will be fixed in the next release.
