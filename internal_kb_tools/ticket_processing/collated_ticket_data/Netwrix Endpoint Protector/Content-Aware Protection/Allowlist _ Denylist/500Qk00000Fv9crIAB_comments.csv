@WaitingOnEngineer
I've tested this on my machine and it works fine. The EPP client blocks access to the mentioned URL (see image below). I've checked the logs as well, but I don't see that this destination should be blocked (I mean it is not found in the list of blocked URLs). Please advise the customer to apply the policies/settings and check one more time. If it doesn't work, do a recording of the scenario and send it to us together with the logs. Make sure you collect all the logs (for example retrovision.db would help).
