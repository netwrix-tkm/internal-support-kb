"500Qk00000GaLmLIAV","00422829","Support Ticket","CAP - DPI Allowlist not showing up in policies","Hello,

We have noticed a recent bug/issue with how the policies behave in relation to the DPI allowlists. 
It looks like there isnt any list/dictionary selected even though there actually is. Even if we select one, save and then look back into the policy nothing shows up. Even though the whitelist is being applied we would want it to show up, like it used to do, as things might get really confusing without the visibility.

I will upload a screenshot in order to clarify what I mean exactly.

Could you please verify and let us know how we can get this solved? From what we can remember this was not an issue previously.

Kind regards,
