I will answer to question number 2, as for question number 1 more input is better provided by @Alex PuskasÂ .

For question number 2:
""Uninstall attempt"" event is sent when there is any interaction with the Endpoint Protector uninstaller, either automatic or through user manual triggering.

""Force uninstall attempt"" is sent when the Endpoint Protector service was stopped incorrectly and any (or all) of the following conditions are true:
- Endpoint Protector driver registry keys are missing/corrupted
- Endpoint Protector general registry keys are missing/corrupted
- Endpoint Protector file components (any of the installed files) are missing, corrupted or access is denied when Endpoint Protector tries to open and protect them from modifications

@WaitingOnEngineer

1. How does Endpoint Protector recognize and detect the PII in 
documents, based on what information / algorithm does Endpoint Protector
 have this ability? 
The algorithm applied depends on the type of file being scanned. Each file type has distinct properties, and the method of extracting information is unique to each one.

Regarding PII, each one has a specific rule: some have stringent rules based on specific patterns (check digits are validated for PIIs that have them), while others are flagged as weak rules on the server side and are encouraged to be used with contextual information.
