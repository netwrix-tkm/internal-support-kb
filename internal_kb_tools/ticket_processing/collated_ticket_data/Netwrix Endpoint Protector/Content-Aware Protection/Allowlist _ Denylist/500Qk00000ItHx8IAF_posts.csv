We aim to block the incognito mode in the Chrome browser by utilizing the application deny list feature in content-aware policies.

Could you please share the steps required to achieve this? Additionally, it would be helpful if you could provide references or guidance on using CLI commands within the application deny list section.

Thank you for your support.

SUPPORT:
I have tested the scenario within my own test environment and I am able to reproduce the issue. Additionally I have also discovered that the EPP Client fails to stop the chrome.exe process from running when a secondary user is launching their Chrome profile.
I have collected the logs while demonstrating the behavior in a short video recording.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-07T11:15:43.000Z"
