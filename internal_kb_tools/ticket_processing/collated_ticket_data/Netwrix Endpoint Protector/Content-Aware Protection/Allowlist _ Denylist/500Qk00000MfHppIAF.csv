Customer name is RubyPlay.
They faced a problem with a false positive URL blocking.
In the Content Aware Report (CAP) menu, we can see that URL was blocked, but it is not included in the URL Denylist.
Content Aware Report (CAP) shows that the policy was triggered on the URL: <a href='https://tunnel.googlezip.net' target='_blank'>tunnel.googlezip.net</a>, but it is not in the Denylists as you could see in the screenshots.
Screenshots are attached.","","- They faced a problem with a false positive URL blocking.
