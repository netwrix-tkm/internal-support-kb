Dear Daniel,

Thank you for your response
Could you please let us know where the tests were performed? Have you used Outlook application, if yes does it have the outlook extension enabled?
--> I use both outlook new UI application and Gmail on web browser.

If you use browsers, does the DPI module is on ?
--> I enabled the DPI module for Chrome and Edge (I tested this case with those browsers).

So, if this is a malfunction, could you give me the alternative file for setting up again?
Thank you and Kind Regards,

Thank you for your responses.

I have tested internally this scenario and on my end I was able to send emails to a @gmail email account, after I added the allowlist in the CAP policy.


Can you please let us know if you added the allowed email accounts in the allowlist from the CAP policy ? 

Looking forward for your response.
