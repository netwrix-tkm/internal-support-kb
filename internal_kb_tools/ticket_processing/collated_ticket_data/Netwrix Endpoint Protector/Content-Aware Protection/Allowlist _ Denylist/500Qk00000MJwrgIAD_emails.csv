Hi Daniel,

It seems like the use case that we were trying to implement is not possible
with EPP, as you mentioned it only blocks the files leaving the system. You
can go ahead and close this request, we will check if there is a workaround
for this.

Hello Gaurav,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00437051
Ticket Subject: Need to block download from specific URLs
Ticket Details: Hi Team,

We need to block download of files or block the files once downloaded, from specific websites without blocking access to that website. Please suggest if there is a way to do this.

Thank you!
