We are looking to block email attachments to free emails like gmail and only whitelist in specific domain users within our company to be able to email attachments out that way.

When we went to do this via Denylists, in the email tab, it couldn't be added to CAP, it seems to be a global. Is the Denylists area the only place to do this? We are not looking to block attachments everywhere, only in places related to say like listed domains ex 'gmail', and only allow specific people, like that of HR.

Thank you kindly for time and consideration.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-12T17:48:45.000Z"
