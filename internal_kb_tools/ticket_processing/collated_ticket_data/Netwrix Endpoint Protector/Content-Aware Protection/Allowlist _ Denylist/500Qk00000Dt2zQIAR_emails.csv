Hi Flaviu,

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

Thanks

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

This issue has been successfully tested by the QA and marked as done in the latest release 5941. The EPP server upgrade 5941 is currently in drip release(25 upgrades/day).

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Hi Team,

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

It would be difficult to use the test build because:

  1.  The alerts are few now.
  2.  It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test build would be incorporated in your next EPP update which you mentioned is due somewhere in November? That way we can see if it removes all these types of alerts.

Thanks.

Hi Team,

Since adjusting the allowlist location setting, I am seeing very few alerts. I'm verifying whether this is coincidental or if those computers/users did not receive the allowlist location settings update.
This will allow me to know if that solution worked on its own or if the test build is needed. I'll update accordingly when I do.

Thanks

Hi Flavio,

I have applied the first suggestion and will observe subsequent logs after to see if it appears. I'll also apply the test build assuming the first suggestion does not solve this.

Hi Flaviu, 

 

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

 

Thanks

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

 

It would be difficult to use the test build because:


	The alerts are few now.
	It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.


 

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test build would be incorporated in your next EPP update which you mentioned is due somewhere in November? That way we can see if it removes all these types of alerts.

 

Thanks.

Hi Team,

 

Since adjusting the allowlist location setting, I am seeing very few alerts. I’m verifying whether this is coincidental or if those computers/users did not receive the allowlist location settings update.

This will allow me to know if that solution worked on its own or if the test build is needed. I’ll update accordingly when I do.

Hi Flaviu, 

 

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

 

Thanks

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Hi Team,

 

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

 

It would be difficult to use the test build because:

The alerts are few now.It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.

 

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test build would be incorporated in your next EPP update which you mentioned is due somewhere in November? That way we can see if it removes all these types of alerts.

 

Thanks.

Hi Team,

 

Since adjusting the allowlist location setting, I am seeing very few alerts. I’m verifying whether this is coincidental or if those computers/users did not receive the allowlist location settings update.

This will allow me to know if that solution worked on its own or if the test build is needed.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416871 -  - [EXTERNAL] Unable to exclude unnecessary and excessive report logs    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Dt2zQ:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","ebenezer.brew@hubinternational.com","kyle.vogley@netwrix.com; john.hilsher@netwrix.com","flaviu.moldovan@netwrix.com","true","2025-03-24T13:21:37.000Z","true"

Hi Flaviu,

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Hi Flaviu,

Thanks for the update. After we upgrade and observe the logs for a while I would let you know. This would be in the new year as I'll wait for the full complement of our IT in case of issues.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

This issue has been successfully tested by the QA and marked as done in the latest release 5941. The EPP server upgrade 5941 is currently in drip release(25 upgrades/day).

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Hi Team,

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

It would be difficult to use the test build because:

  1.  The alerts are few now.
  2.  It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test build would be incorporated in your next EPP update which you mentioned is due somewhere in November? That way we can see if it removes all these types of alerts.

Thanks.

Hi Team,

Since adjusting the allowlist location setting, I am seeing very few alerts. I'm verifying whether this is coincidental or if those computers/users did not receive the allowlist location settings update.
This will allow me to know if that solution worked on its own or if the test build is needed.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416871 -  - [EXTERNAL] Unable to exclude unnecessary and excessive report logs    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Dt2zQ:ref ]","ebenezer.brew@hubinternational.com","Brew, Ebenezer","techsupport@netwrix.com","kyle.vogley@netwrix.com; john.hilsher@netwrix.com","","true","2025-03-24T16:13:17.000Z","true"

Hi Flaviu, 

 

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Thanks for the update. After we upgrade and observe the logs for a while I would let you know. This would be in the new year as I’ll wait for the full complement of our IT in case of issues.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

This issue has been successfully tested by the QA and marked as done in the latest release 5941. The EPP server upgrade 5941 is currently in drip release(25 upgrades/day).

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Hi Team,

 

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

 

It would be difficult to use the test build because:


	The alerts are few now.
	It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.


 

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test build would be incorporated in your next EPP update which you mentioned is due somewhere in November? That way we can see if it removes all these types of alerts.

 

Thanks.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416871 -  - [EXTERNAL] Unable to exclude unnecessary and excessive report logs    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Dt2zQ:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","ebenezer.brew@hubinternational.com","kyle.vogley@netwrix.com; john.hilsher@netwrix.com","flaviu.moldovan@netwrix.com","true","2025-03-24T18:26:41.000Z","true"

Hi Flaviu, 

 

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

This issue has been successfully tested by the QA and marked as done in the latest release 5941. The EPP server upgrade 5941 is currently in drip release(25 upgrades/day).

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Hi Team,

 

Following up from my last e-mail, the alerts continue to be few. The few that happen occur on different computers /users which are all online and are subject to those same whitelist file location settings as far as I can tell.

 

It would be difficult to use the test build because:

The alerts are few now.It occurs as and when to different users which would make it hard to run on a specific computer/terminal server with some users as it may occur on others instead.

 

Though the alerts are now few, having them at zero would be more ideal. My question is whether the fix in the test b","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416871 -  - [EXTERNAL] Unable to exclude unnecessary and excessive report logs    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Dt2zQ:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","ebenezer.brew@hubinternational.com","kyle.vogley@netwrix.com; john.hilsher@netwrix.com","flaviu.moldovan@netwrix.com","true","2025-04-28T17:21:15.000Z","true"

Hi Flaviu,

The issue I indicated with some of our terminal servers not upgrading was only recently resolved. I'm attempting to update them all to 6.2.4.2  and observe the logs when they occur.
I hope to give you an update this Friday or early next week.

Thank you.

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.

Hi Ebenezer,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

This issue has been successfully tested by the QA and marked as done in the latest release 5941. The EPP server upgrade 5941 is currently in drip release(25 upgrades/day).

When time allows please try and upgrade the EPP server and the EPP clients and see if the issue persists.

Hi Flaviu,

 

The issue I indicated with some of our terminal servers not upgrading was only recently resolved. I’m attempting to update them all to 6.2.4.2  and observe the logs when they occur.

I hope to give you an update this Friday or early next week.

 

Thank you.

Hi Flaviu, 

 

Most of our terminal servers are getting upgrade failed messages so feedback on this ticket may delay. Our IT may re-open a ticket concerning that if it persists.

 

Thanks

Hi Ebenezer,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked and the Whitelist is added now. We saw that you were using an older EPP client version, we asked if you could please upgrade the EPP client to the latest version so we can see if the issue still persists. Our devs asked if with the whitelist/allowlist setup and latest EPP client the issue persists. The latest EPP client also has improved logs so if the issue still persists the logs will be more accurate.

Next steps would be:
1. Please upgrade the EPP clients.
2. After upgrading the EPP clients please check to see if the issue still reproduces.
3. If it does reproduce, please generate a new set of logs and allow the issue to reproduce itself. After that please send us the logs and we will further investigate this internally with our devs.
