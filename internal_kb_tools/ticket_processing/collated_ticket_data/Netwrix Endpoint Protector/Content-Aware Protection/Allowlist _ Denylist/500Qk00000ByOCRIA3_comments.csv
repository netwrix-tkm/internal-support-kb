Hi @Alex Puskas
Thank you for the feedback.  I had another remote session with the customer today and we made sure that there are no CAP policies active, uploads via WhatsApp app were still blocked.  Please see the attached video recording demonstrating the behavior and also the epp client logs collected in today's remote session.

After remote session, we concluded this was NOT a problem/bug from Epp agent.

It is seems to be related to Netskope, when the netskope is enabled.

This issue can be closed.
