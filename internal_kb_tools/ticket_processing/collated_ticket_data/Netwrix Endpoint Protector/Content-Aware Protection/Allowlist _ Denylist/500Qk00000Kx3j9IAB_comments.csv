Hi Flaviu,

Is this related to Old Outlook or New Outlook?
The work for New Outlook is not yet complete.
Thank you,
Cristi

As requested we have followed the steps from there. Surprisingly the OU number was the same.

The solution did not work internal emails still get blocked.

Settings: 
DPI - enabled
Reporting V2 - enabled
We only left 1 single policy active for the user and tested.
Checked Allowlist and CAP Allowlist - looked okay

We have made a recording of the issue:

Also please find new logs attached here(New Logs folder):

Please advise.

Hello,

Instead of @mortonbank.com, @mimecast.com, etc. include the version without the ""@"".
So mortonbank.com, mimecast.com, etc. 
Also, leave FYDIBOHF25SPDLT there.
This should solve the issue. 
I want to point out that when you include a domain ex. the ones mentioned above, it's important to not include ""@"". I agree it's cumbersome and prone to error. :)
