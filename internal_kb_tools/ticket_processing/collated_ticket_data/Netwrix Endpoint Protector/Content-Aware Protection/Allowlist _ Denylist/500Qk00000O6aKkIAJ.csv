"500Qk00000O6aKkIAJ","00442218","Support Ticket","Support for Configuring Email Domain Whitelists and Denylists","Dear support team,

I have a case regarding setting up an allow and deny list for controlling email sending. Here are the details of the problem: 
First and foremost, I have created a deny list that blocks users from sending emails to the Gmail domain, so I defined the deny list as ""<a href='https://gmail.com' target='_blank'>gmail.com</a>."" It worked as expected.

Second, I created a policy that contains an allow list for excluding specific users from sending emails to the Gmail domain, for example, ""<a href='https://phuongnguyen@gmail.com' target='_blank'>phuongnguyen@gmail.com</a>."" But when I tested it, it was blocked as well.

Could you help me fix this? I would appreciate it if you could give me a detailed guide for the correct setup. 
Let me know if you want further information. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.
