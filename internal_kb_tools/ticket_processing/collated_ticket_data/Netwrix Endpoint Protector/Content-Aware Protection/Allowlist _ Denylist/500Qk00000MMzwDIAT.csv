Customer name is AsiaBank.
Could you please clarify if it is possible to exclude specific Printers from CAP scanning?
For example, customer has a department where print should be allowed, and they want to add a few printers to the Allowlist, so users can freely print documents.
We know that a similar feature already exists for USB devices.
If it is impossible to do the same for the printers, we would like to register a feature request for this option to be added.","","Based on our tests this is not possible as this is available only for storage devices.","As per this we opened a feature request: https://netwrix.productboard.com/insights/notes/view/2206-all-notes/notes/46693434","Created the Feature Request https://netwrix.productboard.com/insights/notes/view/2206-all-notes/notes/46693434","","Marian Ilies","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","6.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","CoreWin Tech","2025-02-27T11:31:23.000Z","2025-03-05T11:17:30.000Z"
