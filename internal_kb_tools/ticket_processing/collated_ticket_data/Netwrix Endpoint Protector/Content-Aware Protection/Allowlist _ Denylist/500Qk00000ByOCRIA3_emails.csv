I opened an internal case and submitted the logs collected on today's call to your Dev team, however upon going through the log files I found two more Content Aware Policies that were applied to your machine during our call.  Could you also please remove your machine from these two remaining policies, update the polices on the epp client and observe if the ""Content Aware Protection"" tab is still visible in the EPP client 'notifier'  and let me know please?

The two Content Aware Policies are:

'Anaconda Block-Windows'
'Personal Data Exception'

Please do let me know the outcome of the above action at your earliest convenience.


Kind regards

I just received feedback from our Dev team.  They confirmed that according to the epp client logs submitted that the uploads were blocked due to CAP policies being enforced.  We have to make sure if the issue persists even no policy is loaded and capture new logs.

Would you have time today for another call please? If yes, please remove all cap policies for your machine prior to our call so that we can save time while doing a debugging.
