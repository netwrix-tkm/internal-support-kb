We are currently encountering an issue with the Content Aware Protection policy. Specifically, when we edit or modify the policy, the Default File Allowlist is not being accepted as expected. Consequently, this is leading to false positive logs being generated for files that have already been whitelisted or allowed.

We would appreciate it if you could arrange a call to review this issue in detail and provide us with a suitable solution at the earliest.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-13T11:14:05.000Z"

After going in the CAP policy, adding the Allowlists and Saving, after a refresh or Log Out, the Allowlist remained as previously saved - works correctly.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-01-21T09:09:47.000Z"
