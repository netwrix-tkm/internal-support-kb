In my opinion, it seems like you didn't understand how the workaround works.

The issue with these allowlist dictionaries is that they don't remain checked when selected on the CAP page. It is not visible in the user interface, but you can find this information on the admin action page.
Based on this issue that the dictionaries are not remaining checked in the UI, we need to mention:

If the customer needs to modify any information, they must always check ""Allowlist Files"" and/or ""Deep Packend Inspection"" for the Policy Allowlist.


If these dictionaries are not selected each time, they will not be included in the policy.

If you checked these dictionaries, the UI will remain the same (no selection), but you can verify on the Admin Action page if the policy reflects your preferences.

It is normal that the dictionaries are not shown as selected in your attached video (it is a bug that we have now).
