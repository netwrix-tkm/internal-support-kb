Thanks for your time this afternoon Emil.

Please find attached the diagnostics, logs and example files I tried to upload.

Unfortunately I had to recreate the logs as I switched the client back to ""None"" debugging mode but in doing so it deleted the log files which I wasn't expecting. I switched debugging back on and tried to upload the files again in the hope of reproducing the problem, which it did.

For reference the domain I was using is our test domain https://quotes.schemeswriter.co.uk/

I think EPP is blocking me from attaching the ""dummy.txt"" files I used but they were just text files containing 6 or 7 email addresses.

 

Thanks,

 

 

Michael

Thanks,

Hi Emil,

Looks like it is still an issue. We have an allow list set up for our UAT
domain but documents uploaded above the threshold for the CAP policy still
seem to block.
If we could get this fixed or set up correctly it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael
