I worked with a member of support at the beginning this month to address a false positive my users were receiving. We had set up the website <a href='https://segaldev.crm.dynamics.com' target='_blank'>segaldev.crm.dynamics.com</a>* to be on the allow list. Despite that, they are still getting these notifications. Can you advise how we can fix this on our instance please?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-24T17:09:53.000Z"
