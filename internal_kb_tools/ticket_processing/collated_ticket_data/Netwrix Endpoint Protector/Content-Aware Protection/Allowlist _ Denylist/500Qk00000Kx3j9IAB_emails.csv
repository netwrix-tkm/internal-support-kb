Please let me know if you had a chance to look over the previous emails.

Instead of @mortonbank.com, @mimecast.com, etc. include the version without the ""@"".
So mortonbank.com, mimecast.com, etc.
Also, leave FYDIBOHF25SPDLT there.
This should solve the issue.

Please let me know if this resolves the issue.

Hello,

Just wondering if there was any additional information regarding this issue. I'm increasing this ticket to High severity as it is inhibiting daily workflow especially for some of our high level audit teams.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #433235 - email domain not being bypassed by CAP policy    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Kx3j9:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","joel.cox@mortonbank.com","","flaviu.moldovan@netwrix.com","true","2025-03-11T14:54:48.000Z","true"
