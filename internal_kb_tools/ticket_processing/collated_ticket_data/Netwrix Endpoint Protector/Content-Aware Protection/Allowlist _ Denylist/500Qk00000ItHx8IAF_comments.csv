After I watched the video, only the chrome.exe was added to be blocked without any parameter. (and works as expected when the chrome executable is launched without any paramter).

When the incognito mode is launched the chrome executable is launched with some parameters. To block the executable with all possible parameters you can use * like ""general"" parameter.


Please see the following image and use the same setting on the customer side.


Application: chrome.exe
Parameters: *

Thank you for the feedback.  

Adding ""chrome.exe"" in ""Application & CLI Command:"" and then "" *"" in ""Parameters:""
Blocks the regular chrome application as well.  The customer wants the regular chrome to work and only block the incognito window of Chrome.

The feedback was relayed to the customer and they came back with this:

 ""I tried the mentioned steps but it is also blocking the normal chrome window. Additionally, it is showing that chrome_exe is blocked even though I have mentioned chrome.exe in the denylist.""

I am also able to reproduce this in my test environment. please see short video recording and logs in the attachments folder.

Could you please have a look at the screenshot and see if I maybe misconfigured?

How can we modify the parameters to only block the incognito windows of Chrome?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-12-18T18:23:34.000Z","2024-12-18T18:23:34.000Z","false","false"

This sounds like a feature request to block the incognito mode for Chrome process @Krzysztof Staszalek  (we can think about something, NOT using applications denylist).

Why Denylist is NOT a solution? (just using a workaround)
The parameters used by chrome app in incognito mode selecting from a normal chrome window (please see the below image) HAS the same parameters like when the chrome app is started. (the same parameters used).




Unfortunately we cannot found a perfect solution using Application Denylist, the following workaround can be used like a ""solution"":

chrome.exe * --incognito
chrome.exe * --disable-databases *

These settings will block the incognito mode selecting:

	 - 	new incognito window from START Menu
	 - 	new incognito window from chrome app started normally before

Using these settings the chrome application cannot be started if you will click on chrome app (because one of the chrome process will have --disable-databases parameter, BUT the chrome process can be started using the ""New Window"".

Thank you for your feedback, I have tested "" chrome.exe * --disable-databases * "" on windows and can confirm that this work to make incognito windows unusable (it still opens up but one cannot browse ).

I have tried a similar config for macos, i tried:
    Google Chrome * --disable-databases *
    Google Chrome * --incognito
    Google Chrome * --incognito *

But this does not work, is there perhaps a similar workaround for macOS ?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-24T08:22:15.000Z","2025-01-24T08:22:15.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer

I managed to investigate this item, and as I mentioned, we can provide a workaround solution on both Windows and macOS.

The following setting can be used:

Application & CLI Command: ""Google Chrome *""
Parameters: ""* --disable-databases *""

As I mentioned, on Windows, simply clicking on Google Chrome will not work; the user must right-click and select 'New Window'.
I think this item can be closed. @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan
