I've encountered an issue where I create a list of sites in order for them to be excluded of getting blocked, but when I select that list in the CAP policy and hit apply, it goes back to empty when I check if it is still selected.","","the issue was caused by a 5940 bug, so I told the customer what the workaround is and asked him to test
in the meantime they started experiencing server issues - it goes down once in a while
we informed the devops team, they said there are some CPU spikes which might be the culprit. since they only have 1 CPU, the sales and product team were involved
the extra CPU was added and the optimisation procedure was applied
remote session with customer to go over their configuration
the customer is not using shadows or alerts and their policies or not taxing","monitor server until friday","allowlist issue was fixed in server version 5941
server is working correctly after adding the extra CPU and performing the optimisation procedure","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","53.1","Closed - Resolved","Bemobi","Guillermo Vidal","2024-11-25T16:55:38.000Z","2025-01-17T18:27:25.000Z"
