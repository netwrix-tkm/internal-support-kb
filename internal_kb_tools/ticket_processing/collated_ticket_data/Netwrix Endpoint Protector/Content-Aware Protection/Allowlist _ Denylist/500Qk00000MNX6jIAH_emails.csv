Hello James,

From our Zoom session, it seems we need to reschedule since the user was unable to join. You mentioned that the user is attempting to run a file with a domain attached, but the EPP software is blocking it. Could you clarify the current location of this file? Additionally, what is the outcome when you add the file to the whitelist in the EPP UI?

To add the file to the whitelist, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlists > File Location.
2. Turn on ""Include subfolders for File Location Allowlists"" if applicable.
3. Select ""Add,"" then enter a Name (e.g., test2) and Description (e.g., test2), and input the file location.
4. Select the appropriate Groups and Computers, then click ""Save.""




5. Update the policies from the client computer and perform a test.

What happens after adding the file to the whitelist? Please let me know the results of this test and if the issue persists. Also, could you provide your availability for this week or next week, so we can schedule another remote session?

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ramon,

 

  We still ran into the same issue. Would you mind if we scheduled a session with the end user who’s able to replicate the issue and go from there? For this week, it looks like we have times here in CDT:

 


	Wednesday the 5th between 8-8:30am
	Thursday the 6th between 8-9am, and 10-12pm 
	Friday the 7th between 8am-9am


Thank you for your time and support!

Hello James,

From our Zoom session, it seems we need to reschedule since the user was unable to join. You mentioned that the user is attempting to run a file with a domain attached, but the EPP software is blocking it. Could you clarify the current location of this file? Additionally, what is the outcome when you add the file to the whitelist in the EPP UI?

To add the file to the whitelist, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlists > File Location.
2. Turn on ""Include subfolders for File Location Allowlists"" if applicable.
3. Select ""Add,"" then enter a Name (e.g., test2) and Description (e.g., test2), and input the file location.
4. Select the appropriate Groups and Computers, then click ""Save.""


[cid:981564c0-0744-4e71-9064-30b614e97731@Image_0_]

5. Update the policies from the client computer and perform a test.

What happens after adding the file to the whitelist? Please let me know the results of this test and if the issue persists. Also, could you provide your availability for this week or next week, so we can schedule another remote session?

Thank you.

As per our remote session today here are the three options to address the issue you are experiencing:

1. Create a Separate Policy for Developers: Establish a distinct policy where email addresses are not classified as PII (Personally Identifiable Information). This will prevent the system from scanning or blocking emails based on their content.

2. Whitelist Websites: Allow access to specific websites used for uploading email addresses by adding them to a whitelist, ensuring seamless operations without unnecessary blocks.

3. Implement a Complex Regex: Develop an advanced regex pattern to identify email addresses, excluding certain domains that should be exempt. By using this regex, email addresses can be deselected from the general policy, relying instead on the regex for detection. Be aware that this option is more complex, potentially demanding additional resources and effort for implementation.


Please let me know if you have further questions or would like for me to close this case.

Thank you and have a great weekend!

Hello James,

As per our remote session today here are the three options to address the issue you are experiencing:

1. Create a Separate Policy for Developers: Establish a distinct policy where email addresses are not classified as PII (Personally Identifiable Information). This will prevent the system from scanning or blocking emails based on their content.

2. Whitelist Websites: Allow access to specific websites used for uploading email addresses by adding them to a whitelist, ensuring seamless operations without unnecessary blocks.

3. Implement a Complex Regex: Develop an advanced regex pattern to identify email addresses, excluding certain domains that should be exempt. By using this regex, email addresses can be deselected from the general policy, relying instead on the regex for detection. Be aware that this option is more complex, potentially demanding additional resources and effort for implementation.


Please let me know if you have further questions or would like for me to close this case.

Thank you and have a great weekend!

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello James,

From our Zoom session, it seems we need to reschedule since the user was unable to join. You mentioned that the user is attempting to run a file with a domain attached, but the EPP software is blocking it. Could you clarify the current location of this file? Additionally, what is the outcome when you add the file to the whitelist in the EPP UI?

To add the file to the whitelist, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlists > File Location.
2. Turn on ""Include subfolders for File Location Allowlists"" if applicable.
3. Select ""Add,"" then enter a Name (e.g., test2) and Description (e.g., test2), and input the file location.
4. Select the appropriate Groups and Computers, then click ""Save.""




5. Update the policies from the client computer and perform a test.

What happens after adding the file to the whitelist? Please let me know the results of this test and if the issue persists. Also, could you provide your availability for this week or next week, so we can schedule another remote session?

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello James,

From our Zoom session, it seems we need to reschedule since the user was unable to join. You mentioned that the user is attempting to run a file with a domain attached, but the EPP software is blocking it. Could you clarify the current location of this file? Additionally, what is the outcome when you add the file to the whitelist in the EPP UI?

To add the file to the whitelist, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Denylists and Allowlists > Allowlists > File Location.
2. Turn on ""Include subfolders for File Location Allowlists"" if applicable.
3. Select ""Add,"" then enter a Name (e.g., test2) and Description (e.g., test2), and input the file location.
4. Select the appropriate Groups and Computers, then click ""Save.""


[cid:6fbe2f37-3488-420a-8dde-8f0ae6470485@Image_0_]

5. Update the policies from the client computer and perform a test.

What happens after adding the file to the whitelist? Please let me know the results of this test and if the issue persists. Also, could you provide your availability for this week or next week, so we can schedule another remote session?

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

  *   Wednesday the 5th between 8-8:30am
  *   Thursday the 6th between 8-9am, and 10-12pm

Thank you for your time and support!

Hello James,

This is Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I've been assigned to your case. Could you please let me know when you would be available next week for a remote session to address this issue? It would be helpful if you could include your preferred time. Once I have your available days and times, I'll schedule a session to assist you in determining why the EPP client software is no allowing email domains within a file, such as a text file and others.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
