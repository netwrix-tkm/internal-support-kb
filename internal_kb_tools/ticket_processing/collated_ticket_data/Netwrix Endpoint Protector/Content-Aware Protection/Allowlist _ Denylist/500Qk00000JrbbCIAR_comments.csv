This is something that should work. Any logs with the scenario? Did you check to see if the settings were received by the EPP client? There should be something like this in the logs:

12-30 09:42:47.330 25852 DEBUG Received application blocking rule: WinWord * [epp::AppChecker::loadBlacklistedAppList AppChecker.cpp:139] 

When you add the block rule make sure you put ""*"" at parameters (of course besides WinWord at ""Application & CLI Command""). We had an issue in the past, something had to be added there as well, I don't know in what server version was fixed, I see the customer is using 5940. I just tested on my machine, with a 5941 server and everything works as expected, Word is blocked.Â

I checked the logs. According to the logs, there was only one app added to the denylist, that is Anydesk. What did the customer wanted to block? I thought it was Word, at least I see Word is started at some point. Add the settings again and redo the tests. Make sure the customer is not affected by the issues we had in 5940 with allowlists and denylists that sometimes were not saved/applied properly.
