Client is having difficulties with setting up an allowlist to make it work and is also concerned about the banner from the allowlist where he's getting a recommendation about ''Using a large number of long lists can affect EPP Client performance. Keep lists concise for optimal performance.''.


Update 25/04/2024

Connected remote with the client in regards of the case to take a look and explained what that recommendation is and how it works.
Client did not actually had any problems with the allowlists/denylists, they just wanted to see if it's problematic to see that message.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-25T08:51:17.000Z"
