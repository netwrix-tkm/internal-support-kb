I see that in one case at least, the destinations recorded by the EPP client were the following:

/o=ING-Exch/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=e92f378db048408faf02173cfc5793fe-MBX-WP0395766;

/o=ING-Exch/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=f46e85f97c804836aed766f9d007ba3f-TC21SV;
/o=ING-Exch/ou=External (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=be71912ebf0b44b4aae1d92a540d27c3;
/o=ING-Exch/ou=External (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=53b229958ee54524b264ae02653d403c;
/o=ING-Exch/ou=External (FYDIBOHF25SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=5f385c2eb2


If they confirm that all the recipients they tested with are in their domain, then the solution for them is to add also: ""FYDIBOHF25SPDLT"" in the whitelisted domains. It seems that some users are detected a little bit differently. I don't know why they have that ""External"" tag there.
