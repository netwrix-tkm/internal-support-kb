"500Qk00000Lnv1AIAR","00435639","Support Ticket","Denylist with Content Aware Policy goes wrong","I created a deny-list and am going to implement for the company eventually. It has been working well without VPN, but if I connect to work VPN I start to have trouble when on the internet and receive ERR_Failing etc. messages. The VPN is set to not block stuff, and works fine normally. But when I turn on the Content Aware Policy, the deny-list I made starts blocking and I can't visit additional sites as well.","","The EPP CAP and DPI negatively affect the Mac computers to access the network resources.
During the remote session, we enabled the DPI Smart Logging for Ismail's Mac and the issues seemed to be resolved, but after a computer reboot, all the websites, and the Zoom app were blocked.

We have sent the necessary steps for collecting the epp client logs.

We have opened an R&D ticket to further investigate the collected logs:  00436075

R&D replied to us to test with the latest epp client from 5.9.4.1 and collect the extended DPI logs if the issue is still reproducing.","We are waiting for the customer to upload the eppclient logs to further investigate this case.

We are waiting for the R&D to provide the next steps.

Waiting for the customer's availability for a remote session.","Closing the ticket as the customer informed us that the issue was resolved.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Allowlist / Denylist","","","47.1","Closed - Resolved","DataVisor","Ismail Reyhanoglu","2025-02-12T17:00:12.000Z","2025-03-31T18:50:48.000Z"
