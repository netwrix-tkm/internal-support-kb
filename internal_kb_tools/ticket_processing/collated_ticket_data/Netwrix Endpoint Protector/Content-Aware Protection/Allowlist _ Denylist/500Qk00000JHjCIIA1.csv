2/4/2025:

The EPP server is at 5.8.1.0 and EPP database is at 5.9.2.0. Emil and I, attempted to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.3.0, but encountered issues with not being able to access the File Traing and Content Aware Reports.

We then reverted back to the snapshot we created today and now able to access the File Tracing and Content Aare Report logs, yet the EPP console reports 5.8.1.0 and the database is at 5.9.2.0.

We enabled Stealthy DPI Driver from the Device Control > Global Settings

We ran tests from customer's computer and found that items wanted to block from Microsoft Outlook failed to block attachments or content.

We downloaded the client agent software to customer's computer after we determined that the EPP software was not included in the Outlook Add-ons

We also included the domain they wanted to allow to sent content and attachments to and successfully blocked and allowed content from outlook.

Customer later reached out directly to TSE to schedule a remote session to upgrade to a slightly higher version
Responded back to customer stating that they would need to create screen shots of the current configuration then revert back to snapshot created on 2024 in order to go ahead with the upgrade. 
Asked customer if they still wanted to perform the upgrade today
