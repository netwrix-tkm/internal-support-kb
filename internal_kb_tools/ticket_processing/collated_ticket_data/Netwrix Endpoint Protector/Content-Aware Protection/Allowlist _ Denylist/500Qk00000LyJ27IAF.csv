I have configured the CAP policy to include all browsers and have added the necessary files to the deny list. Now, I need to whitelist Google Drive and specific SharePoint URLs to allow users to upload files on these platforms.

I attempted to add the Google Drive URL to the allowlist and linked the list to the CAP policy, but it is not working for Google Drive. However, the same approach worked for Gmail.

Could you please suggest possible resolution steps?

Thank you for your support.
