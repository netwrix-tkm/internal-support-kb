Customer name is AsiaBank.
Could you please clarify if it is possible to exclude specific Printers from CAP scanning?
For example, customer has a department where print should be allowed, and they want to add a few printers to the Allowlist, so users can freely print documents.
We know that a similar feature already exists for USB devices.
If it is impossible to do the same for the printers, we would like to register a feature request for this option to be added.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-27T11:31:24.000Z"
