Seems like he had a problem with uploading XSLX and DOCX documents through WhatsApp desktop, even though the CAP policy was properly adjusted to block those file types and as exit points he selected both WhatsApp apps.

Also for entities he selected the computer properly as he had computer only as higherarchy.

After some tests, I figured the problem was with MTP scanning that was disabled and asked him to restart and concluded that was the actual problem which was not enabled.

After doing that and testing again, the files were blocked successfully.
Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-11T12:17:33.000Z"
