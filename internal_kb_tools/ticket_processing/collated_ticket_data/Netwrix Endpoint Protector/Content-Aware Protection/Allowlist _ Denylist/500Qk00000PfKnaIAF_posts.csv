Connected remote with Sabeesh to take a  look at the case.
He wants to prevent users from accessing other domains than their business one using GMAIL.
Advised on how to use the CAP->DPI Allowed business accounts option and added their domain there.
We tested afterwards on a machine and it was blocking other domains without a problem.
Closing ticket.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-06-03T12:08:36.000Z"
