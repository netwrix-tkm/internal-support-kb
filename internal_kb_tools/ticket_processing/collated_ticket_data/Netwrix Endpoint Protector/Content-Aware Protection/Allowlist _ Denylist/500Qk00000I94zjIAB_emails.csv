Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
Could you please tell me your availability for this week so that we can arrange a remote session via Zoom to further investigate this matter? 
We would need access to an affected computer in order to reproduce this scenario.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
I have sent you the instructions on 14th of November in this email thread, I will add them below again:

You would need to uninstall the current client and download a new client from the UI, making sure that the box with ""Install with Outlook Add-on"" is marked.
I'll add a screenshot from it below:
