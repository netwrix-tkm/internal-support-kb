Hello Emil, how you doing?

We've made another tests and now the internal e-mail sending is working fine.

We didn't changed anything in our policieis, we just had to reboot the virtual appliance for other reasons and now is working as it was before to this user.

I think we can give-up this call for 11:00 AM.

Thanks for the help by now.
