We have tried to trigger Bank Account UK predefined content but unsuccessfully. 

We tried the following formats : 
*8D + 6D ( 12345678 123456)
*8D + 6D with space (12345678 12 34 56)
*8D + 6D and - (12345678 12-34-56)
*8D (12345678)
*6D (123456 , 12 34 56 , 12-34-56)

Can you please let us know what we are doing wrong? In the past, you provided the format for the UK bank account as 8D + 6D with or without spaces).

Thank you!
