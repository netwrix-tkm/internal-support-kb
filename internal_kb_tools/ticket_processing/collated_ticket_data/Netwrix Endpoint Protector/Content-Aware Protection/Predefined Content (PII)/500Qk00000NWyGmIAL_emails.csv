Thank you for joining today's remote session.

Here's a brief recap of our meeting:


	We discussed and configured a CAP policy to block predefined content on Slack when using Google Chrome by utilizing the URL Categories feature.
	URL Categories can be found under Denylists and Allowlists, and it is dependent on DPI (which needs to be enabled).


You can find the relevant documentation here: URL Categories Documentation.

We are going to close this ticket, but if you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to reach out.
