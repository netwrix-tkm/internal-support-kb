I checked internally and unfortunately we do not have an exact date for the 5.9.4.3 release. An approximate period would be 2-3 months from now.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have
earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and
a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

 

Best regards,

Hi Augusto and Lucas,

I checked internally and unfortunately we do not have an exact date for the 5.9.4.3 release. An approximate period would be 2-3 months from now.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

 

Best regards,

I checked internally and unfortunately we do not have an exact date for the 5.9.4.3 release. An approximate period would be 2-3 months from now.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

Hello Flaviu,
 

I installed the client provided and the transfers really worked. But checking the logs i could see that it is still reporting with some type of bypass:

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

Hello Flaviu,
 

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

I checked with the engineers and it seems that the log is not actually reporting any bypass action.
The EPP Client scanned the zip file and inside the file, there was a file named bypass_state.db which was reported.

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.

Hello Emil,

Yeah, make sense, but at the same time i have no report only policy. One
was blocked and one was forcibly reported. Is that a function on the new
agent?
- The one that was reported and not blocked had the false positives.
- The one that got blocked had true CPF(id/br).

Hello Emil,
 

Yeah, make sense, but at the same time i have no report only policy. One was blocked and one was forcibly reported. Is that a function on the new agent?
- The one that was reported and not blocked had the false positives.
- The one that got blocked had true CPF(id/br).

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

I checked with the engineers and it seems that the log is not actually reporting any bypass action.
The EPP Client scanned the zip file and inside the file, there was a file named bypass_state.db which was reported.

Emil

Hello Lucas,

I will ask internally about the logs and why they report this bypass event and I will get back to you with an update tomorrow.

Hello Flaviu,
 

I installed the client provided and the transfers really worked. But checking the logs i could see that it is still reporting with some type of bypass:

Hi Lucas,

We have received an update from our colleagues on this.

They have agreed to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

Download links:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

These test builds should be used only on few test machines to confirm if the solution will help this customer as well. Please do not share this client with other customers as they are test builds and we would need your feedback on them.

Please get back to us with feedback after testing these agents on a few test computers.

Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. The customers can decide which or both pattern to use. This solution will be delivered in combination(5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (not yet determined).

There is any way to create a custom build or anything that we could have earlier? This problem is direct affecting any sale that we try to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

 

Best regards,

Hi Augusto and Lucas,

I checked internally and unfortunately we do not have an exact date for the 5.9.4.3 release. An approximate period would be 2-3 months from now.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Hi Lucas,

I have received an update regarding your question with what improvements have been brought to ID's that fixed the issues in our testing today.

5941 had only 1 fix regarding PII -> ignoring the Office font file. This was fixed because it was generating a lot of false positives.

We will wait to hear back from you regarding the testing.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP server and client to 5941 and after that we tested again. Data seemed to be blocked correctly now. We will wait for you to further test and let us know if issue is resolved with latest versions.

In the meantime I am checking to see if there were specific upgrade/fixes in 5941 to id and id/br. I will get back to you on this.

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for the remote session today!

As we spoke we recorded the explanation of the issue. Unfortunately as the licenses expired we could not generate the logs and replicate the issue.

We will wait to hear back from you this Friday or next week and we will schedule a remote session to replicate the issue after the licenses have been added/extended. Please also try to upgrade the EPP server and client to 5941 and create a snapshot in AWS before that of the EPP server, or we can do the upgrade together in our future remote session.
