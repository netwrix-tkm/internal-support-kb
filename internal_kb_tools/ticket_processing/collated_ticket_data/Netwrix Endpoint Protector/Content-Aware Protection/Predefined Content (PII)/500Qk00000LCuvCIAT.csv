We are conducting a POC for one of our customers, Univest Stocking PTV LTD. The POC is nearing closure, with only two pending issues:

1. The Netwrix EPP certificate is not installed on web browsers. Additionally, the customer uses a device requiring biometric authentication (certificate-based) to access certain websites.
2. SSN and Tax ID for both text and images (OCR) is not working as expected.

We kindly request the support team to schedule a meeting with the customer to address these issues and expedite the POC closure.

Best regards,","","Issue with OCR","schedule a remote session","Issue solved in the remote session","","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Predefined Content (PII)","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2025-01-29T09:55:24.000Z","2025-02-05T11:30:51.000Z"
