Hello Flaviu,

It seems that Zachary Roy from Netwrix is unable to attend the meeting
today. Could you clarify Zachary's role?

I want to make sure that everyone necessary is present for the call. Since
our request is not urgent, should we consider rescheduling for next week?

Additionally, you mentioned, ""We would also like to test, if possible, some
uploads/file copies to investigate the false positives."" I currently don't
have any file copies. Should I prepare some?

Here's our availability:

   - Wednesday, June 26:
      - 09:00-10:30 AM EST
   - Thursday, June 27:
      - 09:00-11:30 AM EST
   - Friday, June 28:
      - 09:00-11:00 AM EST

Please let me know a time that works for both of you. We're flexible and
can adjust to your schedules.

Zachary's role is similar to mine, as being part of the Support Team. He is unable to attend the meeting today as it is a Holiday in the US, where he is from.

Even in his absence we should be okay from our side.

We would like to replicate the exact behavior that was causing the issue. I also mentioned file copy as I was not 100% sure what actions determined the issue. If it is upload actions then we can replicate that behavior and generate logs for that.

With the above clarifications, please let me know if you would still like to keep the meeting we have scheduled for today, or if I should pick another interval for next week.

Hello Flaviu,

It seems that Zachary Roy from Netwrix is unable to attend the meeting today. Could you clarify Zachary's role?

I want to make sure that everyone necessary is present for the call. Since our request is not urgent, should we consider rescheduling for next week?

Additionally, you mentioned, ""We would also like to test, if possible, some uploads/file copies to investigate the false positives."" I currently don't have any file copies. Should I prepare some?

Here's our availability:


	Wednesday, June 26:
	
		09:00-10:30 AM EST
	
	
	Thursday, June 27:
	
		09:00-11:30 AM EST
	
	
	Friday, June 28:
	
		09:00-11:00 AM EST
	
	

Please let me know a time that works for both of you. We're flexible and can adjust to your schedules.

 
Kind regards,

Hi Colin,

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session this week Tuesday-Friday and we will take a look together. We would also like to test, if possible, some uploads/file copies to investigate the false positives.

Please let me know some time intervals and your time zone.
