In the meeting we have performed the following steps:
- we have removed the pending emails from the database
- restarted the mailer alerts
- verifying the mail.log that shows that the emails are being sent.

After we have re-added the Email Server Settings on the EPP console and sent the test email, the alerts started to be received by your inbox. 

We have also tested with Siva' devices for 3 times and all the email alerts were sent and visible in your inbox.

A new test was performed with an additional user, which was also successful.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-04-15T10:21:29.000Z"
