 Hello Lokesh,
 
 Thank you for your patience regarding this case.
 
 We have received the following response from our R&D team.
 
 The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.
 
 Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.
 
 You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.
 
 Looking forward for your response.
 
 Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 
 
 Thank you for getting back to us.
 
 We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
 We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
 The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.
 
 Note:
 Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
 The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.
 
 Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?
 
 Have a nice day ahead!
 
 Best regards,

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received the following response from our R&D team.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.

Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead!

 Hello Lokesh,
 
 Thank you for your patience regarding this case.
 
 We have received the following response from our R&D team.
 
 The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.
 
 Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.
 
 You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.
 
 Looking forward for your response.
 
 Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 
 
 Thank you for getting back to us.
 
 We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
 We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
 The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.
 
 Note:
 Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
 The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.
 
 Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?
 
 Have a nice day ahead!
 
 Best regards,

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received the following response from our R&D team.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.

Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received the following response from our R&D team.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Thank you for your prompt response.

Have you tried with the steps provided in our previous email?

The results are the same? Not receiving the test email ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hi team,

 

 

root@eppserver is not a fully qualified user so mailbox server will reject the mail.

Hello Lokesh, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.

Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,
 
 Thank you for your time in today's session. 
 
 In the meeting we have checked and received the test email, but the endpoint didn't have connection with the server so we can test. 
 
 After performing an uninstall and reinstall we could communicate with the server.
 
 We have also create a device control alert, which hasn't been received. 
 
 As we agreed, we will reschedule the session for the next week at 11:30 IST . 
 
 If the time frame doesn't suit you, please let us know.
 
 Have a nice day ahead!

 Hello Lokesh,
 
 Thank you for your patience regarding this case.
 
 We have received the following response from our R&D team.
 
 The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.
 
 Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.
 
 You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.
 
 Looking forward for your response.
 
 Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 
 
 Thank you for getting back to us.
 
 We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
 We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
 If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
 The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.
 
 Note:
 Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
 The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.
 
 Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?
 
 Have a nice day ahead!
 
 Best regards,

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have checked and received the test email, but the endpoint didn't have connection with the server so we can test. 

After performing an uninstall and reinstall we could communicate with the server.

We have also create a device control alert, which hasn't been received. 

As we agreed, we will reschedule the session for the next week at 11:30 IST . 

If the time frame doesn't suit you, please let us know.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received the following response from our R&D team.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.

Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead! 

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have checked and received the test email, but the endpoint didn't have connection with the server so we can test. 

After performing an uninstall and reinstall we could communicate with the server.

We have also create a device control alert, which hasn't been received. 

As we agreed, we will reschedule the session for the next week at 11:30 IST . 

If the time frame doesn't suit you, please let us know.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Lokesh,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received the following response from our R&D team.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We received an update from our Engineering team that starting with the 5940 version  modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
We added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.

Please test with this steps and let us know if you receive emails from the custom address you setup ?

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session.

 

In the meeting we have performed a few troubleshooting steps to check why the emails are not being received . 

 

In the EPP backend we found that there is a connection timeout error with your relay, which is due to the Microsoft security who is seeing root@eppserver as an invalid email address with an invalid domain.

 

I will investigate this internally and get back to you as soon as possible. 

 

Have a nice day ahead!

We have arranged a remote session for 13:30 IST.
 
As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following steps:
- we have removed the pending emails from the database
- restarted the mailer alerts
- verifying the mail.log that shows that the emails are being sent.

After we have re-added the Email Server Settings on the EPP console and sent the test email, the alerts started to be received by your inbox. 

We have also tested with Siva' devices for 3 times and all the email alerts were sent and visible in your inbox.

A new test was performed with an additional user, which was also successful. 

Please test this by adding multiple users and let us know if the situation persists afterwards.

Have a nice day ahead!

 Hello Lokesh,
 
 Thank you for your time in today's session. 
 
 In the meeting we have performed the following steps:
 - we have removed the pending emails from the database
 - restarted the mailer alerts
 - verifying the mail.log that shows that the emails are being sent.
 
 After we have re-added the Email Server Settings on the EPP console and sent the test email, the alerts started to be received by your inbox. 
 
 We have also tested with Siva' devices for 3 times and all the email alerts were sent and visible in your inbox.
 
 A new test was performed with an additional user, which was also successful. 
 
 Please test this by adding multiple users and let us know if the situation persists afterwards.
 
 Have a nice day ahead!
 
 Best regards,

 Hello Lokesh,
 
 We have arranged a remote session for 13:30 IST.
  
 As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
 This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
  
 Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
  
 Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
  
 -Putty
 -Zoom
 
 Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

 

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

 

In the meeting we have performed the following steps:

- we have removed the pending emails from the database

- restarted the mailer alerts

- verifying the mail.log that shows that the emails are being sent.

 

After we have re-added the Email Server Settings on the EPP console and sent the test email, the alerts started to be received by your inbox. 

 

We have also tested with Siva' devices for 3 times and all the email alerts were sent and visible in your inbox.

 

A new test was performed with an additional user, which was also successful. 

 

Please test this by adding multiple users and let us know if the situation persists afterwards.

 

Have a nice day ahead!

 

Best regards,

Hello Lokesh,

 

We have arranged a remote session for 13:30 IST.

 

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

 

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

 

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

 

-Putty

-Zoom

 

Best regards,
