Have you checked if port 587 is blocked or not?

Have you tested the SMTP with an internal email address? I want to make sure that no firewall blocks emails from being sent.
Did you receive the success message when you checked the sent test email and saved the settings?

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,


As product team confirmed on this case, TLS 1.3 improvements were implemented in 5.9.2.0 release and is successfully tested by our QA and hundreds of customers (Jira:).So for sure this is SMTP configuration/routing issue on customer side. Issue should be resolved by their SMTP support team or provider.
Thank you

We had a new remote session with the customer and there are a few connection timeout received on the /var/log/mail.log with their relay.

Hi,

Starting with the 5940 version an issue was added ""326369  Issue with triggering Alerts - the ""From"" email address needs to be changed"".

This modification will be applied only for email alternative transport.
Added a checkbox to enable the use of a custom sender and a custom sender email input to be displayed when TLS 1.3 is checked on System Settings --> E-mail server Settings or e-mail configuration wizard.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is checked and a custom email is provided, then the 'From' attribute will have the provided custom email address.
If the checkbox to enable the custom sender is not checked or if the checkbox is checked but the custom sender address is not provided, then the 'From' attribute will have root@eppserver (in our case).
The No-reply email address option will be hidden when TLS 1.3 is checked.

Note:
Depending on the organization's Anti-spam filter policy, using a custom sender for alternative transport may cause the emails to be labeled as Phishing or Spam and sent to Quarantine.
The usage of a system service to send emails will still set root@eppserver (in our case) as the sender in mail.log and email headers because it is normal behavior. The provided custom sender address will be used only for the email ""From"" header.




If you want to use this issue, please talk to the customer and try to upgrade the EPP version from 5930 to 5940.

We had a remote session today with the customer and performed the following steps: 

- clear the email settings information save it  and tried to send a test email. was not working since they have the tls 1.3 enabled and configured.
- add all the information manually and test, the test email was not working. 
- changed the port from 587 to 25 and then to 465 none of them were working
- the message that the email is sent is present but the email is not received.
- they verified and add in their Microsoft Exchange the *endpointprotector.com to be whitelisted
- there is no blocking from their side
- we checked the mail.log file where the message first says that is being sent, then errors like "" unable to qualify my own domain name (eppserver)"" -- using short name 
- i have attached multiple screenshots with the errors
- upgrade the EPP server version to 5.9.4.1 and redo the configuration no email was received
- the same config is working on the smtp test tool URL which is sending them a test email 
- perform a reboot to the EPP server 
- the customer is mentioning that root@eppserver is not a normal user and that why they are not receiving the emails 
- before I started the steps from the procedure no.6 Changing the E-mail Server address and display name , a test email was received, which I have notice it after I performed the steps. 
- re add the old settings didn't created any new test emails
- pinged their relay was working

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,


From our perspective, if the customer received the test email, the SMTP configuration is working correctly.

It’s possible that the customer did not set up the email settings correctly.
Please also check the Outlook quarantine.

The error ""unable to qualify my own domain name"" typically means that the system or mail server cannot determine its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This usually happens due to misconfigured hostname settings.

Receiving the email from ""root@eppserver"" it's normal behavior. The service used to send email is one from the system and by default, when the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. In our case, root@eppserver.

You can also share the test email that the customer received with us.

We had a remote session today with the customer and performed the following steps:

- followed the procedure 13.5 (cleaning up the mailer) 
- created a new log, by connecting a device to generate alerts;
- 6 alerts are generated with the message sent ( see screenshot)
- the alerts are not received by the customer
- only one endpoint is selected for that alert and one admin
- the errors receive in the mail.log is that the connection is refused by [127.0.0.1] .

- we have checked in their exchange admin center (in the quarantine and blocked emails) for the emails sent to the sivakaran@karboncard.com and nothing was found.

- screenshots were added to the Sharepoint
- customer would like to solve the issue as soon as possible as they will not renew","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-04-15T09:11:39.000Z","2025-04-15T09:11:39.000Z","false","false"
