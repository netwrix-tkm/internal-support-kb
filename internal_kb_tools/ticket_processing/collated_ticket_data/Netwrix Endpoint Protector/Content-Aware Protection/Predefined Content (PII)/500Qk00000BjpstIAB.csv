Provided the R&D response to the customer to check their server FQDN on the mail server settings.

We had a new session with the customer where we have checked and received the test email, but the endpoint didn't have connection with the server so we can test. 

After performing an uninstall and reinstall we could communicate with the server.

We have also create a device control alert, which hasn't been received. 

We will reschedule the session for the next week to check if the alert will be sent.

In the meeting we have changed the ownership of the Mailer folder, who is responsible with the alerts, from root to www-data . 

Once we perform this step, the alerts started to be received by your email address.

We have agreed with the customer to monitor the alerts, and if they will encounter issues they will let us know. 

Customer is in the testing phase and will let us know if the case can be closed.
