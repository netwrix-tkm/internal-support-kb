@WaitingOnEngineer 
The ""Content Remediation Session Active"" log should appear after a successful send after the remediation. So, please try sending the file again after approving the remediation, then the log should appear on the server.

@WaitingOnEngineer

From received logs and video everything seems to work as expected.

What is the issue reported by the customer ? (the displayed error by excel?)
The error is displayed by the Excel app, because the print action cannot be executed and probably a generic error is displayed by the app (Excel). Other error message will be displayed by other apps (you can try with notepad for example)

Excel document should be sent to the printer without any errors after the print job was authorised by EPP remediation.
-> the user remediation NOT WORKS in this way. Even when the user clicked on ""Authorize"", the print will not work automatically (after remediation), the user must to print again the file (this part worked as expected?)

!!!!!
Logs analysis: please see the following logs AND the returned action:

BEFORE REMEDIATION
08-09 13:34:22.815 7076 DEBUG  csprnthk 3876 880 @Scan document: 'C:Usersandre.eppDesktopsample-data 1.xlsx', returned action is: '1' [cf::ApplicationDlp::debugLogRequest ApplicationDlp.cpp:48]

The customer printed 3 different files:

	 - 	print sample-data 1 -> block (error is displayed by the excel) -> remediated (somehow the printer queue is blocked) -> print AGAIN sample-data 1 -> NO ERROR IS DISPLAYED -> the print NOT worked?
	 - 	print sample-data 2 -> block (error is disaplyed by the excel) -> after remedation and print again worked as expected?
	 - 	print sample-data 1  -> without policy was no error was disaplyed
