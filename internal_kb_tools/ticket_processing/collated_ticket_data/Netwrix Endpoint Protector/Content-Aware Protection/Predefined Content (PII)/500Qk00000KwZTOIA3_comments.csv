Hi @Flaviu Moldovan,
The amount of false positives for this PII is due to the change made for the detection rule. Some formats were added with weak or no rule at all based on the documentation provided by another costumer. For reference and more detailed explanations regarding the formats please see https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/342068#11389499.
As a workaround contextual rules are advised.
There is also a build in which the Brazilian ID detection algorithm is replaced with CPF detection algorithm. CPF is the ID that appears on the new ID cards and is the most commonly used identification number as per my last research.
@Krzysztof Staszalek would it be a good idea to share that build with this customer also?

I have informed the customer that the fix is targeted for 5943.

Questions:

1. Customer asked what is the aimed released date for 5943. EPP release document only shows 5942 date.

2. Please let me know if the build mentioned by Mara in the previous comment can be shared with the customer.

Thank you!

The partner got back to us and asked if there is any way to create a custom build or anything that they could have earlier? Mara mentioned something about this in a previous comment.

This problem is direct affecting any sale that the partner tries to start and a lot of costumers are already using regex as a substitute.

Please advise.

Thank you!

Hi Flaviu,

I agree to share 5941 based test Clients, which alter current definition of Brazilian PII pattern, limiting it only to Brazilian CPF.

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EPPMac3.0.4.3000.Notarized.tar

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp07032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.3000.zip

This test builds in should be used only on few test machines to confirm if solution will help this account as well. Please do not spread this clients with other customer with Product approval.

Please return back with feedback. We can decide about next steps.



Please be also informed that in future we will split Brazilan PII and Braizlian CPF. Customer can decide which or both pattern to be configured.
This solution will be delivered in combination (5942 Server (~April) + 5943 Clients (~~).
