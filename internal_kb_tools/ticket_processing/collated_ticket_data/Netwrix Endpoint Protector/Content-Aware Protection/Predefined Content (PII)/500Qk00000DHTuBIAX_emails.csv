Hello,

I asked customer to test this way, but seems like the issue is still the same.
Perhaps we can schedule a remote session on the next week to look into this issue?

Hi Danylo,

After further testing it seems that the error only occurs after the first attempt to print the Excel sheet after authorizing, upon the second attempt EPP allows to print the Excel sheet.
Could you please confirm with the customer if they are also experiencing the same behavior described as above? please ask them to make another attempt to print the Excel sheet after receiving the error message and let us know the outcome.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with our Dev team and got confirmation that the event logs ""Content Remediation Session Active"" log should only appear after a successful send of a file which was previously intercepted, it will not appear immediately after the remediation approval.

Can we ask the customer to test the scenario in this way please?

  1.  Transfer a file that will violate the Content Aware Protection policy.
  2.  Content Aware Policy intercepts the file transfer.
  3.  User clicks on ""Authorize"".
  4.  User attempts again to transfer the previously intercepted file, this time the file should be allowed to be sent by Endpoint Protector.
  5.  Only after the file was successfully sent will the event log ""Content Remediation Session Active"" appear under ""Content Aware Report"".

Please let me know the outcome of testing in the above order.



Kind regards

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with our Dev team and got confirmation that the event logs ""Content Remediation Session Active"" log should only appear after a successful send of a file which was previously intercepted, it will not appear immediately after the remediation approval.

Can we ask the customer to test the scenario in this way please?

	Transfer a file that will violate the Content Aware Protection policy.
	Content Aware Policy intercepts the file transfer.
	User clicks on ""Authorize"".
	User attempts again to transfer the previously intercepted file, this time the file should be allowed to be sent by Endpoint Protector.
	Only after the file was successfully sent will the event log ""Content Remediation Session Active"" appear under ""Content Aware Report"".


Please let me know the outcome of testing in the above order.



Kind regards

Hello,


Additional to this issue, customer reported about the error with Excel files after remediation if try to push it to print.
Rebooting PC does not help with this issue.
