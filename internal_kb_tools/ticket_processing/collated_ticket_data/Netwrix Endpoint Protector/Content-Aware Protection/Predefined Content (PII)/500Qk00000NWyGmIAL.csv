"500Qk00000NWyGmIAL","00440510","Support Ticket","Questions on making policies for combining PII detection with multiple things","We are going to start maximizing the use of Netwrix. I have been trying to follow how to combine content aware policies but do not understand fully. Like for example, i want it to monitor on Chrome, but only apply PII stoppage on specific wesbites like <a href='https://slack.com' target='_blank'>slack.com</a> for example. I would like to request a Zoom meeting to learn how to apply these as efficient as possible, so I will be reporting the capabilities of Netwrix to my manager. Thank you.","","We asked for a remote session to better explain the EPP capabilities regarding the CAP.

We explained during the remote session how to use URL Categories in CAP policies to block the uploads only for specific websites.","","We explained during the remote session how to use URL Categories in CAP policies to block the uploads only for specific websites.","","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Predefined Content (PII)","","","1.0","Closed - Resolved","DataVisor","Ismail Reyhanoglu","2025-03-31T18:04:46.000Z","2025-04-01T18:39:38.000Z"
