"500Qk00000EP1dbIAD","00418029","Support Ticket","Intune Certificate Deployment , Macs and PII Data Policy Issue, Creating Policies with Logical Opera","I have a couple of questions regarding our Intune and data protection configurations:

1.Intune Certificate Deployment for Macs
How can we deploy Client CA certificates to Macs using Intune?

2.PII Data Policy Issue
We have a policy in place that is intended to block only PII data. However, it appears that the policy is also detecting non-PII data as PII, possibly due to file extensions and regressions. can you provide insights on how to address this issue?

3.Creating Policies with Logical Operators
Is it possible to create a policy using logical operators like OR and AND to refine the data detection criteria? If so, can you provide details on how to configure this?","","","","No answer","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Predefined Content (PII)","","","58.0","Closed - Resolved","Shakta Technologies Pvt Ltd","Lokesh N","2024-08-14T07:56:38.000Z","2024-10-11T07:49:43.000Z"
