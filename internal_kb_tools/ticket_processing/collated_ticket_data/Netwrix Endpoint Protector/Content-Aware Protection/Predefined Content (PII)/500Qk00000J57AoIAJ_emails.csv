It seems that the UK Bank Account numbers were not respecting all the checksum rules.
I got some samples which you can use for testing:
- 871427 99123496
- 309070 12345668
- 180002 00000190
- 66 75 80 19709652
- 99 36 75 36867541

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

 

Sorry for the late reply.

 

I tested with the specific format and the system didn't trigger the format.

 

Please find attached the sample files.

 

Thank you!

 

 


Kind regards,

Csilla

Hello Csilla,

Let me know if you managed to test with the datasests that I provided or if you had the chance to test this with real data.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Csilla,

It seems that the pattern used for testing is in the wrong order.
The sort code has to be first and should be followed by the actual account number. Some of the examples provided are valid and are detected if the order of the digit groups is switched.
The correct formats are:
6D + 8D (e.g. 123456 12345678)
6D with space + 8D (e.g. 12 34 56 12345678)
6D with dash + 8D (e.g. 12-34-56 12345678)
If after the issue still occurs using this formats please collect and send me a new set of logs and sample.
Also, if possible, please try to use some real data for the test scenarios as this algorithm has a strong detection rule and rarely will detect false positives, especially for sort codes.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Csilla,

Our PII pattern for UK Bank Account is:
6 digits (might be grouped 2 by 2 with space between the groups), a space or a tab optionally and 8 digits after (e.g. 12 24 81 06858072).

Let me know if you manage to trigger the policy using the above format.

Thank you,
Emil

Did you had the chance to test if the samples provided by our engineers are being blocked?
If so, I think that you can enable the reporting of UK bank accounts for a small group of computers in order to verify if the real UK bank accounts are indeed reported.

Best regards,
Emil
