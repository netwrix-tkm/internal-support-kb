"500Qk00000F0SIEIA3","00419315","Support Ticket","Confidential files","Hi,
in the ""Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual"" in section 6 ""Content Aware Protection"" (page 75) I read about the possibility to apply policies on the file content. 
Specifically, I wanted to ask what is meant by ""Confidential files"" and how do I define them.

PS: I have the server version 5.9.4.0

Thanks in advance!
