"500Qk00000DHTuBIAX","00415485","Support Ticket","""Content Remediation Session Active"" does not appear in Reports","Hello,

Customer name is Asia Bank.
We made a CAP policy with ""Block and Remediate"" action, and it successfully works.
But in the CAP report these events have type ""Content Threat Blocked"" instead of ""Content Remediation Session Active"".
Could you please help us to figure out why it happens?
We tested on 1 PC with only 1 CAP policy enabled with ""Block and Remediate"" action.
Attaching screenshots:","","","","Customer replied that they did not upgrade their clients yet.
I think we can move this ticket on hold, or close it until we receive some update from the customer.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Predefined Content (PII)","NONE","","221.4","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-07-19T08:45:38.000Z","2025-02-25T17:21:49.000Z"
