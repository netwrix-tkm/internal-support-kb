Thank you for reaching out to us.
Can you please check under Content Aware Protection > Deep Packet Inspection if Text Inspection is enabled?
Is this scenario related with Old Outlook or New Outlook?
Is the EPP Add-in present in the Outlook Options section?
Can you please send us a short recording on when you reproduce the mentioned scenario? Can you also create a set of log files for that?
In order to test this also from our side, please provide us with the test files that you are using and text that is entered manually in the email body.

Best regards,

Hello Alin,

I performed the tests on my own virtual machine.
DPI -> Text Inspection is active.

I conducted the tests on both Old and New Outlook. The issue only occurs in New Outlook. I recorded a short screen capture. You can find the sample files, log files, and screenshots attached.

During the tests, I first tested on Old Outlook and then on New Outlook. Three tests were carried out:

- In the first one, a PDF was sent,
- In the second, a TXT file was sent,
- In the third, content was written directly into the email body and sent.

In Old Outlook, all actions were blocked. You can see the logs in the file named oldOutlooksamples.png.

The same tests were performed in the same order on New Outlook. No action was blocked. All emails were successfully delivered to the recipient (newOutlooksamples.png).

After that, Debug mode was enabled, and the tests were repeated only for New Outlook. This time, the first two actions were blocked (I didn't change anything.) — meaning the sending of the PDF and TXT files was prevented. However, the content written in the email body was still not blocked.

I am waiting for your feedback regarding the issue.

Thank you for the well documented reply from your side, it is highly appreciated.
I inquired internally about this behavior of the EPP client in concordance with New Outlook and this is a current limitation regarding this new face of the app.
Beginning with the server version 5.9.4.3, a new client version will include also a new EPP Add-in that works with Microsoft user accounts and removes the limitation for New Outlook.
Please let us know if you have other queries that requests our assistance or if we can close this ticket for now.
The server version 5.9.4.3 is targeted to be released in the 2nd half of May.

Have a nice day,
Best regards,
Alin Anca
