From the screenshots it seems like a substring of the value of x-transaction-id key from the header of the request resolves as a credit card number.

@Marius Ghiurcau can we do something about this?

@Marius-Viorel Iacob if we detect it as credit card number, most probably it is. The solution I see in this case is to try to ignore entirely that request (or sometimes we ignore a part of it, for multipart requests, but I see in the logs it is not a multipart). We should try to reproduce something similar, most probably the IDs are different and it won't work, but at least to see what is in general in that request and if it can be ignored.

For this issue an easy workaround could be whitelisting ""x.com"" domain if there is no need for tracking it.
The issue does not reproduce on my end so I was not able to properly test this but from the logs I figured we can ignore the scanning of the specific request that contains the threat based on its content type. You can find a test build containing the fix here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_08_23EppMac_v3.0.3.0021.
Please be advised to install this only on one or a few machines as this is only a test build.

The issue in the screenshots from the escalation attachments folder is related to DPI settings rather than the fix from the test build. Please reinstall the client and make sure the certificates are up to date and trusted everywhere it is necessary.
If the problem still occurs please collect extended DPI logs and attach them in the escalation folder.
