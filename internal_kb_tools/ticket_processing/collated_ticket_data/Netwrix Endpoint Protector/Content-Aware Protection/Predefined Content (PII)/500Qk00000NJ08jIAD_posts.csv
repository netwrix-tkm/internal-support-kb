First I checked the machine and it had the latest 6.2.4.2000 installed.

What the problem is, from what I've checked, they are using OCR to detect PII and SSN's for India and for most detections on TXT files and PNGs is working but for images attached to PDFs or JPGs it does not as they are allowed to get through.

NO filetypes were selected inside the CAP policy.

I checked the CAP policy first and the exit points along with the proper predefined content was select accordingly  and also the device was selected too to have the policy applied.

Then I went on the computer settings and saw the OCR was enabled along with the DPI.

Also went on CAP->DPI Settings and enabled monitor webmail and set it up to GMAIL.

Did the same tests again by uploading files on a google mail body and only the TXT and PNGs were detected and reported in the CAP reports. The PDF and JPG passed through without a problem.

Collected the logs and told them to attach it to the ticket.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-26T13:03:50.000Z"
