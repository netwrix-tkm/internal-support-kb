Our PII pattern for UK Bank Account is:
- 6 digits (might be grouped 2 by 2 with space between the groups), a space or a tab optionally and 8 digits after (e.g. 12 24 81 06858072);

The pattern used for testing is in the wrong order. The sort code has to be first and should be followed by the actual account number. Some of the examples provided are valid and are detected if the the order of the digit groups is switched.
The correct formats are:
6D + 8D (e.g. 123456 12345678)
6D with space + 8D (e.g. 12 34 56 12345678)
6D with dash + 8D (e.g. 12-34-56 12345678)
If after using this formats the issue still occurs please collect and upload logs, not only the files used for testing. Also please make sure the customer uses real data for the test scenarios as this algorithm has a strong detection rule and rarely will detect false positives, especially for sort codes. Thank you.

The customer gave us a new set of samples with UK Bank accounts
I attached them here:
https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00428793
(Bank account 1.xlsx; Bank account 2.xlsx and Bank account 3.xlsx)

Since the customers can not test this scenario with real data, they generated all these samples and they were expecting to have at least one of the samples matching the UK bank account.

Let me know if the samples are not respecting all the checksums for UK bank account.

The customers are worried that we might not be able to catch the UK bank account numbers, and they do not want to add them to the CAP policies in the production server until they are sure that we can correctly block the UK bank account numbers.

Do we have any update for this ticket?
Were any of the samples matching the UK bank account? 
The customer can not test the policy with real data, so they have to use samples for the tests. They redo the tests every day/every 2 days in order to make sure that the policies are working fine.
Unless they can see that the UK bank account number is blocked correctly, they are not able to include it in the CAP policies.

The samples provided do not respect out detection rule and that is the reason the policy cannot be triggered. I have tried with our detection rules as well as other online validators and the result was the same, the UK bank accounts provided are not valid.
The current implementation is based on the following document which has a comprehensive explanation regarding the checksums rules as well as the accepted sort codes: https://www.vocalink.com/media/a2febq5m/validating-account-numbers-uk-modulus-checking-v7-90.pdf.
Some UK bank accounts that could be used for testing are:
