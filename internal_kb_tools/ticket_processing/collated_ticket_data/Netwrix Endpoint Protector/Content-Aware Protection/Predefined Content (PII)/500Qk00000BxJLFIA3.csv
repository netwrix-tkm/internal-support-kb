Michael, a reports admin in my EPP instance is seeing some discrepancies in reports that he's run vs actual files that contain confidential information that have been downloaded to our end users machines. 

I'll allow him to add more context here (not sure I can CC someone on a ticket) but it seems our reports show that over 100 more reports exist than EPP has detected.

Is there something we might be missing in configuration?","","","","Discussed several topics.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","Predefined Content (PII)","","","1.8","Closed - Resolved","Wrapbook","Colin O'Shea","2024-06-17T21:22:31.000Z","2024-06-19T16:26:05.000Z"
