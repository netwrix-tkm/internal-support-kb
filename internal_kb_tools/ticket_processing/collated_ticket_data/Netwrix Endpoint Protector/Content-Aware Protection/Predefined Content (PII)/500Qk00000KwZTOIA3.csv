Some of our costumers are facing an issue about the Id/br detecting false positives that doesnt even have the same amount of numbers that the ID should have and other incongruencies. now, i faced that on my side too, so i think it would be best for us to see into that bug on my side while the costumers use a regex as a workaround.
