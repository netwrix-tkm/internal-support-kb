Thank you for your time in today's session. 

I have verified internally,  as we discussed, if there is anything that we can do regarding the threats that are not meeting the threshold. 
As I mentioned in the meeting, you can create a new policy with Report Only action to monitor the file transfers or you can modify the threshold to 1, so that will be blocked and in order to be transferred an approval will be required.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

We would prefer to set the teshould at 5 to better accommodate our needs,
given that our employees frequently share one or two SSA data daily, this
treshould is not practical for our operations.
Let me know if there are any workarounds for this.

Hi Daniel,

We would prefer to set the teshould at 5 to better accommodate our needs, given that our employees frequently share one or two SSA data daily, this treshould is not practical for our operations.
Let me know if there are any workarounds for this.

Hello Pramod,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

I have verified internally,  as we discussed, if there is anything that we can do regarding the threats that are not meeting the threshold.
As I mentioned in the meeting, you can create a new policy with Report Only action to monitor the file transfers or you can modify the threshold to 1, so that will be blocked and in order to be transferred an approval will be required.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,



We would prefer to set the teshould at 5 to better accommodate our needs, given that our employees frequently share one or two SSA data daily, this treshould is not practical for our operations.
Let me know if there are any workarounds for this.

Hello Pramod,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

I have verified internally,  as we discussed, if there is anything that we can do regarding the threats that are not meeting the threshold.
As I mentioned in the meeting, you can create a new policy with Report Only action to monitor the file transfers or you can modify the threshold to 1, so that will be blocked and in order to be transferred an approval will be required.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Pramod,

Please note that it is not possible to get logs for transfers of files that
do not meet the threat threshold value defined in the CAP policy - since
the Threat Threshold field was designed to work as a ""starting point"" or
""minimum"" for the number of sensitive data items inside a file.
If you need to get logs when the file contains at least one sensitive data
item, the Threat Threshold value should be set to '1'.

Please let me know if this clarifies everything.

Thanks,
Natalie
