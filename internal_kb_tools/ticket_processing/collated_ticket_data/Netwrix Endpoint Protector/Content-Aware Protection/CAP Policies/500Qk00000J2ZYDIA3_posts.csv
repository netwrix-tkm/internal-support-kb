They try to make changes of CAP by adding computer/user to the Allowlist, and it does not work on client computers. For users who were historically in the this Allowlist, this problem does not exist. It just happens for the newly added users. They manually did ""update policies now"" on the clients several times, nothing helps. 
They used the CAP to restrict access to the specific network share folder.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-03T15:40:03.000Z"
