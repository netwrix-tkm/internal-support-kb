Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that one user had an issue during the Google Meet:
When a user is in a Google Meet meeting, the sound goes down during the screen sharing and the user cannot be heard by the colleagues (so the microphone stops working as well). 
When screen sharing is stopped, the sound returns. 
If you stop/disable/uninstall the DLP Endpoint Protector client, this issue does not occur.
We have logs and EPP client configuration screenshots.
Could you please look into it?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-22T11:57:59.000Z"

We have requested to have a remote session with the end customer in order to observe the behavior live and also to make a video recording where the behavior is demonstrated so that our developers can see.  This would be very helpful.  We are waiting on the customer's / partner's response.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-23T16:25:00.000Z"
