Our customer is using Yahoo Mail through the Outlook application. They have a daily report email that is being blocked by a CAP rule. We previously created this rule to block encrypted files. When the rule is active, the email is not sent. However, we do not receive any report indicating that it was blocked. When we disable the rule, they can send the email without any issues.

I have attached screenshots of the rule settings and an example email. Additionally, we reproduced the issue and collected logs, which you can also review.

Best regards","","Customer is having an issue with a CAP policy which blocks mail report.
