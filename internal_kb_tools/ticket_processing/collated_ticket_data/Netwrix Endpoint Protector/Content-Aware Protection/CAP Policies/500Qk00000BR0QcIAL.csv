We are trying to configure a CAP that will do the following but can’t seem to figure it out. Hoping you can provide some assistance.

Use Case: We have a specific website that contains sensitive information. We want to block all print screens/screenshots on this website without impacting other print screen/screenshot activities.

Is there a way we can do this? FYI – we’ve tried using OCR but have found it to be unreliable.

OS: Windows
Server: 5.9.3
Agent: 6.2.2.1

Thanks,","","","","No further feedback from the customer.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","119.2","Closed - Resolved","Canada Guaranty","Jaimie Trotman","2024-06-04T15:41:43.000Z","2024-10-01T20:13:49.000Z"
