I hope you are well.
Regarding the way credit cards are identified, please see the process below:

when a digit character follows a non-digit character, we look for a payment card IIN (Issuer Identification Number) 
if a known IIN is matched, based on the matched issuer (Visa, MasterCard, Diners, etc.) we know that we should check for a required number of digits (e.g. 16 digits for MasterCard, 13, 16 or 19 digits for Visa, etc.) 
we allow for certain delimiters (like space, dash, etc.) between digit groups 
finally we validate that the last matched digit (the check digit) verifies Luhn's algorithm 
if all of the above rules match, we report a payment card number. 
So we follow verification of specific pattern's + checksum.

Having this information, please compare this with the scenarios that you are testing and let us know if you encounter any issues.

Thank you,
