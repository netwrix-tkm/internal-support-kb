"500Qk00000GjUK9IAN","00423135","Support Ticket","Eternity (POC) - Linux not blocking source code","Hello Team,

We started a POC with a potential costumer and need help setting up a policy that blocks source code to various points. The policy was applied normally, the client comunnicates, the extended source code is activated, but we couldnt block it to almost anny place. And even the place it blocked (dlptest) it didnt show any report. Let me know if you have availability for tomorrow 10h BRT to check on this.

Best regards,","","","","Closing ticket as question was answered, as we do not support Delphi Pascal. Only regular Pascal.","","Zachary Roy","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","28.1","Closed - Resolved","FcBrasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-10-07T15:26:34.000Z","2024-11-04T18:39:09.000Z"
