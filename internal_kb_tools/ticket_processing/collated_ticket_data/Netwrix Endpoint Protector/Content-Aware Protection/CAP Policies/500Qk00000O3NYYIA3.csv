"500Qk00000O3NYYIA3","00442024","Support Ticket","Contextual Detection","When I had one contextual detection, i generated xml file and it showed next to ""Applicable Contextual XML:"" Now I have 3 contextual lists, and more will be coming. On the screenshot attatched, do i press generate, and all 3 lists will be generated? Or is it only the latest one I worked on? Also on other screen shot for making contexual lists for credit card, under 'Type', there are options for Amex, Disover etc. Does that mean I have to make a contextual list for every type of credit card we want the list to apply to? Or is selecting 'Amex' enough to cover all credit cards like 'Discover'.","","Customer has questions pertaining to the generate button for Contextual detection and if one credit card type would apply for other types of credit cards

Sent customer information relating to generating policy and that a separate policy is needed for each credit card
