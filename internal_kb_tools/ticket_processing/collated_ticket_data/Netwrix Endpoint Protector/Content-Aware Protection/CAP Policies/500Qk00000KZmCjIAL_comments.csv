@WaitingOnEngineer
I have analyzed the latest logs.

As mentioned in my previous comment (

https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/370763#11727579

), formats such as ACE, bz2, xz, xar are not supported by EPP client to be scanned by contents. For the rest of compressed formats (.rar, .tar, .gz, .zip) I can see that the compressed were scanned successfully and a block was performed.

If the client does not scan by contents, does that mean this feature is practically non-existent?

ACE, bz2, xz, and xar file formats are also listed as check items.

If they are not supported, why do they exist?
And does the fact that scanning is not supported due to client-side limitations mean that I created the policy incorrectly? I reinstalled EPP to send the logs, and I only created the CAP policy for testing.

@WaitingOnEngineer

Some archive formats are supported (like .zip, .gz), these are scanned by contents. The other unsupported formats are not scanned by contents.

The check boxes related to ACE/xz/etc refer to the mimetype. So, when a file is determined to be an ACE archive, even if we do not support scanning the contents, we know that it is an ACE archive and the policy could choose to block ACE archives.

@WaitingOnEngineer Did the customer enable the checkboxes for bmp/gif/pdf mimetypes to be blocked in the CAP policy? If yes and they were still not being blocked (inside the .zip/.7z archives), please the collect the logs and upload them so we can analyze them. Please also upload the exact archives with the images which the customer used, if possible, thanks.

Thank you for the update.
The customer mentioned that he did the following when collecting the logs.
Log file : MacOS Log.zip
""
When I sent the logs, the method I tested was as follows:
I created files for (csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp) one by one and then compressed them into (zip, 7z, ace, rar, tar, bz2, gz, xz, xar) archive files for testing.

ex)
zip - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp
7z - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp

I created and tested them like this.

This is the issue I encountered:
For example, when I tested with all the file types checked but not checking the zip file type, I found that csv, xlsx, pptx, docx files were shown as blocked in the logs, but gif, bmp, and pdf were not shown as blocked. (This is an example; the actual blocked files may need to be reviewed.)

Sorry to ask again, but I want to make sure and ask clearly.

If the policy is applied to archive files like test1 image files, do the files inside the archive appear in the logs?
If the policy is applied to archive files like test2 image files, the files inside the archive do not appear in the logs, right?

When applying the policy to ""rar, .tar, .gz, .zip"" archive files like test1, sometimes the files inside are visible, and sometimes they are not.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-17T13:25:19.000Z","2025-03-17T13:25:19.000Z","false","false"
