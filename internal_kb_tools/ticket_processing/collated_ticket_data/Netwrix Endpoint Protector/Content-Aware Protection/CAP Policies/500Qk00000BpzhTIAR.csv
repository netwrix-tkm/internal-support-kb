"500Qk00000BpzhTIAR","00411957","Support Ticket","File Location Denylist [QuadPlus]","Hello Team,

One of our customers has a request regarding file locations.

Our customer has a large number of project folders on a network share. All employees work from this location. They want to mark different file locations (projects) as sensitive for different users. And they want to take separate actions for each folder.

For example, log activities performed in the \192.168.2.200projectprojectid001 file location, block any file from being sent to a USB if someone tries, but allow it if they want to send it via email.

We currently cannot configure an exception rule for File Location Denylists. But is there anything that can be done for this customer’s request? If not, will there be any work on this in the roadmap?","","","","none","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","39.8","Closed - Resolved","Laykon Distributor","Faruk Sarı","2024-06-14T10:20:51.000Z","2024-07-24T06:26:09.000Z"
