I would recommend the users to use the option to exclude specific computers from the policy as in the below example:


This way the customers will be able to include all the computers from a department and ensure that if new computers will be added to the department, they will also be added to the policy. Also, they will have the possibility to exclude only specific computers/users where they want to allow the uploads.

Hello,

Thank you for the recommendation, this feature works well.
But what if customer needs to disable one single PC from all available policies?
Is there some possible  way to make it, except manually change ""exclude"" under every policy?

I've tried to choose ""Select all entries"" and disable the PC in this way, but it did not work, the change did not implement to all available policies.


Best regards,

This has to be done manually for each policy.
There is no possibility to include or exclude a computer/user from all the policies at once because each policy has it's own entities.

I think it should be great feature, so customer will not manually exclude single PC from every policy one by one.
