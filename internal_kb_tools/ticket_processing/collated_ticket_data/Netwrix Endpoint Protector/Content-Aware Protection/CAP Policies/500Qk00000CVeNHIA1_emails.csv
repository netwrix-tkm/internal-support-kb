Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team.
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team.
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team.
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team.
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

I would like to give you an update on the case and issue for the event logs that were not updating since the hotfix was applied.  We have a remedy for this issue, a procedure via the backend of the EPP Server will need to be carried out with a file that needs to imported to the Server back-end via SFTP.

Can we schedule a remote session with you at 7pm IST today or tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST to perform this procedure please?

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

I would like to give you an update on the case and issue for the event logs that were not updating since the hotfix was applied.  We have a remedy for this issue, a procedure via the backend of the EPP Server will need to be carried out with a file that needs to imported to the Server back-end via SFTP.

Can we schedule a remote session with you at 7pm IST today or tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST to perform this procedure please?

Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team.
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards

Thank you for the confirmation.  The invitation was sent to you for 7:30 PM IST today.

For our session the customer will need WinSCP and Putty in order to complete the procedure.


IMPORTANT:
Please perform a snapshot (Backup) in the virtualization platform of the current state of your Endpoint Protector appliance prior to our call to perform the procedure.  This way you will have a safety measure and a quick way to revert back to the previous state in case anything goes wrong during the process.

Hi Ganiraju,

I would like to give you an update on the case and issue for the event logs that were not updating since the hotfix was applied.  We have a remedy for this issue, a procedure via the backend of the EPP Server will need to be carried out with a file that needs to imported to the Server back-end via SFTP.

Can we schedule a remote session with you at 7pm IST today or tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST to perform this procedure please?

Kind regards

Hi Ganiraju,

Thank you for the logs. One more detail that I wanted to confirm, the issue persists after a system restart is this correct?

Hi Ganiraju,

Currently the issue is being investigated by our Dev team.

I wanted to also capture a short video recording that demonstrates how the issue is produced on the hotfix agent v2.4.2.1007 for our Dev team. 
Would it be possible if you could kindly make a short video recording showing that 'hotfix' agent v2424.1007 is not sending CAP event logs, artifact and showing that agent v242.1006 works as expected please? Please also capture the epp client logs for both while reproducing.

If you would like to do this on a remote session then I have a slot open at 2:30 PM IST today.



Kind regards
