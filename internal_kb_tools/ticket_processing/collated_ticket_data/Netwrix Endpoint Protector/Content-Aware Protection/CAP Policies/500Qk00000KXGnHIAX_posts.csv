Weâ€™ve observed that on macOS, enabling ""Cloudflare Services"" causes EPP policies to stop functioning. Both Cloudflare Services and our EPP install certificates in the browser, which seems to create a conflict.

Could you please suggest a workaround to ensure both services can operate simultaneously?

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-13T10:29:53.000Z"

We tested this both on MacOS and also on UbuntuOS, just with these is the issue is present.
The CAP policies that we tested were configured simple with:
- block & report
- exit points selected for the browsers
- some file types selected in the denylist (we had excel, powerpoint, pdf)
- the computer selected in the policy

We have collected logs and also extended DPI logs.
I will also attach some screenshots with the DPI configuration and the Cloudflare solution that they are using.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-01-24T07:51:57.000Z"
