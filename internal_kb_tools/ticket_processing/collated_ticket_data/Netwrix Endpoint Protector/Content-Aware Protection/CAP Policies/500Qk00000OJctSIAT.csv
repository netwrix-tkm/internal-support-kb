"500Qk00000OJctSIAT","00442743","Support Ticket","Google Meet Issue with sound and microphone during the Screen sharing","Hello!

Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that one user had an issue during the Google Meet:
When a user is in a Google Meet meeting, the sound goes down during the screen sharing and the user cannot be heard by the colleagues (so the microphone stops working as well). 
When screen sharing is stopped, the sound returns. 
If you stop/disable/uninstall the DLP Endpoint Protector client, this issue does not occur.
We have logs and EPP client configuration screenshots.
Could you please look into it?","","23.04.2025:
I noticed that the customer seems to be collecting the logs from a test build version ""3.0.4.0023"" we need to test and collect the logs from the latest official version ""3.0.4.1006""","23.04.2025:

We have requested to have a remote session with the end customer in order to observe the behavior live and also to make a video recording where the behavior is demonstrated so that our developers can see.  This would be very helpful.  We are waiting on the customer's / partner's response.","Partner sent:
""We can temporarily close this ticket, until the main issue with Google Meet won't be resolved. And then if this issue will recreate I will do a follow-up.""","Product defect","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","35.1","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","CoreWin Tech","2025-04-22T11:57:58.000Z","2025-05-27T15:28:59.000Z"
