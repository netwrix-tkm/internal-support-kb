@WaitingOnEngineer

Related to customer's request, we need to inform him that this is the way the EPP client reports confidential data found in files. I will try to explain a bit. Let's suppose you have a ZIP archive, with several files in it. If the EPP client finds threats in different archive members, I suppose it will be nice to have them reported separately. So that the customer knows where exactly the threat was found. Now, you can see an XLSX file as an archive as well (because it is in fact an archive). And this archive contains several files, most of them xml files. If your xlsx files has 20 sheets, there will be 20 different xml files, for each sheet. And other xmls there as well (such as sharedstrings.xml). Now, all of these will be scanned and reported separately if threats are found in them. 

So, long story short, related to what the customer reported, I don't think we will do anything. This is by design like this.

Side note, no need to mention anything to the customer since they did not report/complain. I saw in the reports something that I will try to check when there is more time (some xmls inside the xlsx called ""threadedCommentX.xml"", which we might need to handle specially in some cases).
