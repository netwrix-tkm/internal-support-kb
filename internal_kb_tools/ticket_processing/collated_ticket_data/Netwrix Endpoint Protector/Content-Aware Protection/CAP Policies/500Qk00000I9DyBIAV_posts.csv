We have attempted to configure some Content Aware Policies, and have puposely excluded OneDrive, because there was too many false positives showing up. 
Firstly, OneDrive is still showing up as being detected in the logs. 
Secondly, is there a way to configure the policy so we do not have to exclude anything (so not to risk missing anything important), but with less false positives. 

Happy to have a call if it will be easier.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-11T11:26:45.000Z"

Endpoint Protector is designed to report multiple event logs for confidential data found in files. 
Here is a brief explanation, let's suppose there is a ZIP archive, with several files in it. If the EPP client finds threats in different archive members, it us useful to have them reported separately. So that the Endpoint Protector administrator knows where exactly the threat was found.  Now considering that XLSX files are archive as well and it contains several files, most of them xml files.  If the xlsx file have 20 sheets, there will be 20 different xml files, for each sheet and other xmls there as well (such as sharedstrings.xml).  All of these will be scanned and reported separately if threats are found in them.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-05T06:25:10.000Z"
