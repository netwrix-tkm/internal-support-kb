Hello Rushikesh,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00421908
Ticket Subject: How to add new users to the Default block policy by default once onboarded to the portal
Ticket Details: Hi Team,

We have two concerns mentioned below -
1) How we can add the new username and hostname to the block policy (by default once the user is onboarded on the portal)
2) How to identity the devices and username if they are added to the policies or not)

Please connect with ASAP, to discuss about these issue/ quires.
