One of the issues here was the way our data was extracted from the xls archive and the separators that we insert between the rows. For this a fix was made and you can find the test build containing it here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_01_29EppClient_v6.2.4.0055.
While investigating I found that there are hidden rows in the documents containing PIIs.
There are also some false positives due to our weak detection rule (because of the lack of public data for the checking algorithm) for ua ID and it is advisable to use contextual detection.
@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan Can you please help with the download link? Thank you.
