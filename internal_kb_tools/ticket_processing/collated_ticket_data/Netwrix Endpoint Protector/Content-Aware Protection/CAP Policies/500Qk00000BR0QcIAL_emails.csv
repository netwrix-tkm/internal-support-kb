Unfortunately EPP does not cover the use case that you described. Currently we can only block print screens/screenshots as a whole, and not for particular websites.

If you would like I can raise this as a Feature Request internally with our dev team to see if this is in the scope of a DLP and see if it can be implemented in future versions of the EPP server.
