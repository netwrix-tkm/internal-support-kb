Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I am reassigning your ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. They will contact you soon. 

In the meantime, can you please explain your issue in more detail? Is the issue that your policy is not working on new outlook or that you cannot attach items to emails in new outlook?

Hi Zachary,

 

We have a content policy to limit the upload through our Teams.

 

Since few users switch to the new Outlook version, when they try to send an attachment, endpoint detect it has an Teams attachment and block it.

 

Regards,

Hello Guillaume,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I am reassigning your ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. They will contact you soon. 

In the meantime, can you please explain your issue in more detail? Is the issue that your policy is not working on new outlook or that you cannot attach items to emails in new outlook? If it is the first part of the policy not working in new outlook, then I suggest enabling DPI for a test machine and testing again.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
