Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan I have applied ""62. 5600-5900 Vulnerability fix v1.1 - manual backend procedure"" or another customer and that resolved their issue.  I am waiting on this customer to respond for my request of remote session so that I can perform the procedure for them too.

Thank you

I hope you are well.

The issue has been tracked under https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/345259.
Currently, there is a fix in place which is already available, and also, back end procedure #62 from this Google Doc, explains how this fix can be manually applied.

I hope this helps.

Please let me know if I can further assist.

regards,
Cristi

Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan  

There is an update and correction that I need to make on this case.

Correction:
The issue is produced for both epp agents v2.4.2.1006 and v2.4.2.1007.  On our first call it seemed that the issue was only produced on v2.4.2.1007 but on our second call we discovered that the events logs for Content Aware Protection was partially working, please see the attached screenshots showing CAP event logs made on the 1st July and on the 3rd July (second call). They applied the live hotfix patch on the 28th June. On our second call we tested again with both versions v2.4.2.1006 and v2.4.2.1007 and the event log ""Content Threat Blocked"" did now show for the file upload that we tested with on both agents.  We captured the logs for both agents and I have attached it also to the ADO

     June

	 - 	Endpoint Machine Operating System: Linux
Ubuntu 22.04
	 - 	Versions of EPP Clients Producing the Issue:

It would be useful to know how many clients the server is serving (total and online) when the issue is reproducing
