1. What is the CAP policy set to block?
Does it block if you send it to a browser?

2.How fast did you try to send the file? The same file is not reported if you try to send it after a fe second again, but it will be blocked.

3.Did you create a new CAP policy after I added the new selection? Or thry to save it with it deselected and save it again with it selected.
We can also check if I added it correctly to the backend in a remote connection.
How does the customer send the file? Like we did on your server with drag and drop?

Kind regards

Hello,

1.
The CAP policy was configured to block ""Graphic Files"" and ""Office Files"" from ""Windows App.""
I only tested file redirection from a redirected folder on Mac to another folder on Windows.
File transfers via Chrome on the same Mac worked properly.

2.
Since I tested file transfers multiple times using various methods, I don't believe transfer speed (whether fast or slow) is relevant in this case.

3.
I'm not sure whether a new policy was created under a new CAP.
I tested using the customer's existing policy, and in the customer's CAP policy, all ""applications"" were checked under ""Policy Exit Points"" (including the newly added Windows App).
Does a new CAP policy need to be created for the changes to take effect?
I did try deselecting ""Windows App"" in the existing CAP policy, saving it, and then selecting it again and saving it.

The file transfer method was not drag and drop, but rather Command + C / Command + V.
(I tested the same method on my test server, and as shown in the attached log image, a log was generated only when a new file was transferred for the first time. When the same file was transferred multiple times, no additional logs were created.)
In the customer environment, as seen in the log file I shared, no logs were generated at all.","Netwrix Support Ticket #443449 - windows app - Not Functioning Properly in Customer Environment","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","daehee kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-04-29T06:54:06.000Z","true"

Can you please try to create a new cap policy then see if the issue remains?

When the same file was transferred multiple times, no additional logs were created.
- This is expected. If a file is sent often for some time the log is not generated to avoid multiple logs bein generated of the same file.

If it does not work we can shcedule a remote connection to add it again.

Hello,

It seems that the Windows App is currently not functioning properly.

1. Tested with a new CAP policy
2. Drag & drop and copy/paste actions are not being blocked, and no logs are generated
3. Tried with multiple files, but the result was the same
4. Neither ""Report only"" nor ""Block and report"" policies are triggering logs or blocking actions
5. No logs are visible in the real-time log as well

Given the above, would it be possible to schedule a remote session sometime next week to investigate this issue?","Netwrix Support Ticket #443449 - windows app - Not Functioning Properly in Customer Environment","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","daehee kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-04-30T01:41:11.000Z","true"

We would appreciate it if the remote support could be scheduled between May 7 and May 9, anytime between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM (KST).

Please note that remote access from macOS is not feasible in this environment. Instead, we can provide remote access to a Windows machine that has access to the web console.
While you are connected to the Windows environment, the customer will simultaneously conduct tests on macOS and share the results with you.","Netwrix Support Ticket #443449 - windows app - Not Functioning Properly in Customer Environment","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","daehee kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-04-30T02:03:26.000Z","true"

Thank you for sharing your availability. One of my colleagues will contact you regarding this, as I will be out of the office.
In the meantime, please select both Windows app and Microsoft Remote Desktop in the policy and see if the file is blocked.
