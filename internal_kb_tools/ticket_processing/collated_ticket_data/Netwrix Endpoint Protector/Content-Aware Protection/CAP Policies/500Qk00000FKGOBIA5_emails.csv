Hi Zachary,


Thank you for the update.  I have implemented the change below – we will be testing it this week to see if the error comes back.  I will keep you posted, please keep this ticket open and will let you know if we need to schedule a call.


Thanks again!


Best,


Tin


Hello Tin,

I have received an update from engineering. They have two recommendations for the time machine issue.

The cause of the issue is due to scanning over 300k files causing the time machine backup to fail.

In order to resolve it, we can do the following:

1. Add the following file locations to the file location whitelist and add it to the policy assigned to the machine

-/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/
- /Volumes/Backups of */*
- /Volumes/Backup */*.previous/*
- /Volumes/Backup */*.inprogress/*

2. Set the right for the specific device that is being used as the time machine backup location to ""allow access and exclude from CAP scanning""

This will ignore scanning of any file transferred to the device.

If you would like a meeting to implement these recommendations, we can set something up for next week.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
