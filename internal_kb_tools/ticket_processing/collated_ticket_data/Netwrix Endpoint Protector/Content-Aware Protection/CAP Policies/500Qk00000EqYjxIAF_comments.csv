Here you find the SQL that counts the CAP logs:


--- CODE ---
SELECT count(*) from cf_log;
--- CODE ---

Can you please check if the DC logs appear on the UI (Log Report -> Log Reports)?

Share with us also:

--- CODE ---
desc  cf_log;
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
desc olog;
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---desc cf_log_details;--- CODE ---

The SQL tables look as expected.

I saw that the hotfix was added only for the 5910 version.
Please apply the 5930 hotfix patch and the backend procedure for 5930 (62. 5600-5900 Vulnerability fix v1.1 - manual backend procedure).

I did advise the customer to upgrade the appliance to version 5940 to address the issue with no event logs for Content Aware Protection but they were unwilling to upgrade.  At the moment the case is with commercial, depending on the outcome. If we would still need to go ahead with the patch then we will make the request to DevOps as the appliance is hosted by us.
Further updates will follow after discussions with the prospect and the commercial team is finalized.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-08-30T14:10:50.000Z","2024-08-30T14:10:50.000Z","false","false"
