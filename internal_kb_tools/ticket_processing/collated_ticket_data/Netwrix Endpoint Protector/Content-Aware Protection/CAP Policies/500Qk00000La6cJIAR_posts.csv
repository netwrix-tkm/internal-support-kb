- Customer requested a remote session to discuss two issues he is experiencing when using EPP 5.9.4.1:

 - Also trying to stop paste function on alternatives paste sites.
 - When someone is using paste bin, list of paste alternatives: EPP does not prevent copy paste information on these sites.
 
https://github.com/lorien/awesome-pastebins
 
- Customer wants to block these sites from accepting paste.
 
 * Deep packet inspection for clipboard is not enabled. Customer does not want to have clipboard enable because it decreases the control of users to do their job.
 
 - Second issue being reported, Outlook is blocking items not meant to be blocked. User not on a blocking policy yet items get blocked. Verified that user show up on two policies yet these policies are for report only not block and report.
 
- Customer created a log report for the user to submit to the case.

Customer has reported 3 new issues with EPP:
1. Blocking Issue on Specific Sites: Certain sites, such as paste.mozilla.org, paste.centos.org, and justpaste.it, are not being blocked by their system, whereas similar sites like Pastebin and dlptest.com are successfully restricted. The reason for this inconsistency is unclear, prompting an investigation into potential gaps or configuration discrepancies.
 
2. Outlook Blocking Issue: Some users are being blocked when using Outlook, despite being part of ""report only"" policies. These blocks occur without corresponding reports, yet the files in question are still being delivered to the targeted recipients. The customer mentioned having sent diagnostic logs, which have not yet been received for further analysis.

3. When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message,


- Requested customer open two seperate cases for 1. Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and 3. When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked.

- Escalation Ticket created for issue 2. Outlook Blocking Issue: Ticket Number # 00437869


- Logs uploaded to case:

- Updated Escalation ticket 00437869 with comments and location of the screenshots provided by customer

- Requested customer open a new case for new issues he finds with EPP software
3/5/2025

Customer has reported 3 new issues with EPP:
1. Blocking Issue on Specific Sites: Certain sites, such as paste.mozilla.org, paste.centos.org, and justpaste.it, are not being blocked by their system, whereas similar sites like Pastebin and dlptest.com are successfully restricted. The reason for this inconsistency is unclear, prompting an investigation into potential gaps or configuration discrepancies.
 
2. Outlook Blocking Issue: Some users are being blocked when using Outlook, despite being part of ""report only"" policies. These blocks occur without corresponding reports, yet the files in question are still being delivered to the targeted recipients. The customer mentioned having sent diagnostic logs, which have not yet been received for further analysis.

3. When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message,


- Requested customer open two seperate cases for 1. Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and 3. When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked.

- Customer requested a remote session to discuss two issues he is experiencing when using EPP 5.9.4.1:

- First issue was with paste.mozilla.org
 - Also trying to stop paste function on alternatives paste sites.
 - When someone is using paste bin, list of paste alternatives: EPP does not prevent copy paste information on these sites.
 
https://github.com/lorien/awesome-pastebins
 
- Customer wants to block these sites from accepting paste.
 
 * Deep packet inspection for clipboard is not enabled. Customer does not want to have clipboard enable because it decreases the control of users to do their job.
 
 - Second issue being reported, Outlook is blocking items not meant to be blocked. User not on a blocking policy yet items get blocked. Verified that user show up on two policies yet these policies are for report only not block and report. See attached picture:
