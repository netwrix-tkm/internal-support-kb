Good Morning,


  1.  In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy
We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.
This works fine.
The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.



  1.  When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.
The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.
After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)
The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.


Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Thank you for your email.
1.So if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up
and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited
the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the 
traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Hello Adrian,


1.      Thats right.
As an attachment is our Log for this instance.
We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



  1.  This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud  has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.
As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up
and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them
[cid:image005.png@01DAB737.CFF78380]

2.I understand, I think the issue.So it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited
the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the
traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,


  1.  In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy
We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.
This works fine.
The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.



  1.  When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.
The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.
After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)
The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here-
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,

 

1.      Thats right. 

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have. 

 


	This is right. 


DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud  has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,

 

1.      Thats right. 

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have. 

 


	This is right. 


DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud  has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up
and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited
the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the 
traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,

 


	In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy


We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.

 

 


	When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.


The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here-
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up
and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited
the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the
traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.





Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here-
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Good Morning Adrian,

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.
So I don't think I can upload there.
I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log
But I made this into a .rar file.

Is there a different way to send you this?

Freundliche Grüße

Hi Andre,

I think you have sent over an email to me- however it was moved to spam and I am unable to see it.
If an attachment was used, please upload it via the Netwrix platform, otherwise it will get blocked,

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
 Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don’t think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.





Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hello Adrian,

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.
When I add files individually it works.
But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize
Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Good Morning Adrian,

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.
So I don't think I can upload there.
I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log
But I made this into a .rar file.

Is there a different way to send you this?

Freundliche Grüße

Hi Andre,

I think you have sent over an email to me- however it was moved to spam and I am unable to see it.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So<https://1.So> <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So<https://issue.So> <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is<https://operating.Is> <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BNgRj:ref



Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

 

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
 Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don’t think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,

I think you have sent over an email to me- however it was moved to spam and I am unable to see it.
If an attachment was used, please upload it via the Netwrix platform, otherwise it will get blocked,

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So  <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.





Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hello Adrian,

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.
When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.
I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded.
Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.
Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files.
The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt
Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.
Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.
When I add files individually it works.
But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize
Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
[cid:image007.png@01DABC11.74B44C90] Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
[cid:image008.png@01DABC11.74B44C90]After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So<https://1.So> <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So<https://issue.So> <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is<https://operating.Is> <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BNgRj:ref



Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,

 

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.

When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.

I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded. 

Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.

Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files. 

The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt

Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

 

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.

Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

 

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
 Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Effective May 3rd, 2024, opening?NEW?tickets by e-mail is no longer possible.Please use our Support Portal to submit a case.If you’re not already signed up, you can create an account at the following link and access the portal:  https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html.Please refer to our Support Reference Guide for details on support process including available contact methods, SLAs, and case severity guidelines.Best Regards,

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don’t think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,

I think you have sent over an email to me- however it was moved to spam and I am unable to see it.
If an attachment was used, please upload it via the Netwrix platform, otherwise it will get blocked,
Thank you!

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So  <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.





Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Good Morning Adrian,

I don't see a difference with the denied file location.

I couldn't add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer
I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.
When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.
I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded.
Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.
Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files.
The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt
Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.
Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.
When I add files individually it works.
But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize
Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
[cid:image008.png@01DABCAD.CC9657E0] Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
[cid:image009.png@01DABCAD.CC9657E0]After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.

Good Morning Adrian,

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.
So I don't think I can upload there.
I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log
But I made this into a .rar file.

Is there a different way to send you this?

Freundliche Grüße

Hi Andre,

I think you have sent over an email to me- however it was moved to spam and I am unable to see it.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So<https://1.So> <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So<https://issue.So> <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is<https://operating.Is> <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BNgRj:ref



Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Good Morning Adrian,

 

I don’t see a difference with the denied file location.

 

I couldn’t add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,

 

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.

When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.

I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded. 

Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.

Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files. 

The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt

Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

 

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.

Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

 

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
 Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don’t think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So  <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BNgRj:ref



Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

I do have some updates.

They managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected.
Next, they enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.


The only aspect that they would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.


In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, they  will prepare a test build with some additional logs.


 For testing, they used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version are you testing with?

Good Morning Adrian,

 

I don’t see a difference with the denied file location.

 

I couldn’t add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,

 

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.

When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.

I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded. 

Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.

Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files. 

The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt

Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

 

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.

Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders
since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

 

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-
 Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud
After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don’t think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So  <https://1.So> if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Good Morning Adrian,

we also use Nextcloud client version 3.13.2
At the moment we don't have a licence to test this.

We postponed to buy, because of this issue with Nextcloud.

Hi Andre,

I do have some updates.

They managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected.
Next, they enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.


The only aspect that they would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.


In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, they  will prepare a test build with some additional logs.


 For testing, they used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version are you testing with?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I have raised up the case internally, and I managed to get the logs as well.
I will get back with more updates, once available,however as mentioned, do please note that this will take some time.
Thank you for your patience meanwhile!

Good Morning Adrian,

 

I don't see a difference with the denied file location.

 

I couldn't add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,

 

Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.

When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.

I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded. 

Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.

Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files. 

The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt

Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.

 

I tried the File Location but nothing happened.

Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

 

Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,

 

i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings-  Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying  to send over the data via Nextcloud After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,

 

i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don't think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.

 

I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.

 

Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So <https://1.So>  <https://1.So <https://1.So> > if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So>  <https://issue.So <https://issue.So> > it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is>  <https://operating.Is <https://operating.Is> > encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.





Freundliche Grüße
Andre Tinnemann

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf <https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf>
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Good Morning Adrian,

we also use Nextcloud client version 3.13.2
At the moment we don't have a licence to test this.

We postponed to buy, because of this issue with Nextcloud.

Hi Andre,

I do have some updates.

They managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected.
Next, they enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.


The only aspect that they would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.


In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, they will prepare a test build with some additional logs.


For testing, they used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version are you testing with?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I have raised up the case internally, and I managed to get the logs as well.
I will get back with more updates, once available,however as mentioned, do please note that this will take some time.
Thank you for your patience meanwhile!

Good Morning Adrian,



I don't see a difference with the denied file location.



I couldn't add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for the clarifications, I understand the context.
If you wish, I can have this case raised internally- but as mentioned last time, it will take a while until we get any feedback, as you prefer.
I recall from last time, that you have the logs on the machine still.

As for the File location, this needs only to be selected on which computers or Groups or both it will apply, as seen below .

Hello Adrian,



Nextcloud is Monitoring a folder.

When something is put inside the folder, nextcloud is synchronizing.

I copied a sourcecode.txt file with sourcecode inside this folder and it was not uploaded.

Also with a forced synchronization it was not uploaded.

Now I copied a new empty.txt file inside this folder and Nextcloud uploaded both files.

The sourcecode.txt and the empty.txt

Only the empty.txt which had no sourcecode should have been uploaded.



I tried the File Location but nothing happened.

Do I need to add the file location rule somewhere in the policy?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I understand, so if I understand correctly, individual files are blocked from upload, but not folders since it syncs the entire directory?
Is it unsuitable for you to use the individual file upload?
If this is not attainable- you could try to block perhaps the upload of files via blocking the location of the uploads, as per below,if suitable.

Hello Adrian,



i made the changes and at first it looked like it worked.

When I add files individually it works.

But when I added a file which he is allowed to synchronize

Nextcloud synchronize the whole Folder. Together with alle Source Code files

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.I have 1 more idea if you don't mind.Let us try and switch DPI to active from Device Control- Global Settings- Save the settings.
2.Lets try to create a Denylist for the IP of the server, where you are trying to send over the data via Nextcloud After this was created- go to Content Aware protection tab,Content Aware Policies, edit a policy- and from the Policy Denylist subcategory- select the Domain and URL- and enable the newly created denylist for the IP of the network.
Is uploading data top the blacklisted network being denied now?

I understand. As far as I've heard- since we recently migrated to new ticketing system,I will leave below the guide.

Good Morning Adrian,



i did not open the Ticket over the Netwrix platform. So my account is not link to this ticket.

So I don't think I can upload there.

I think my ticket was created by the sales rep.



I was trying to send you the SupportTool Log

But I made this into a .rar file.



Is there a different way to send you this?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.

Hi Andre,
Thank you for your email.
We can have a call with the customer- for the second issue if needed.
As far as I can tell, most likely logs will need to be collected, and a case will need to be raised internally, if I will be unable to figure out the issue/behaviour.
However- as a fair notice here, this will take quite some time- as our R&D team are currently busy with a migration which is still in place.
Also, if a German speaker will be required, I can inquire internally about this, and another engineer will assist them as I don't speak Deutsch.

Hello Adrian,



1. Thats right.

As an attachment is our Log for this instance.

We know that we can deactivate all pop ups. But in other instances it is nice to have.



2. This is right.

DPI is not active

Our Nextcloud has no Encryption active

I tried with deactivated AV program so there should not be a program wo intervenes.

As far as I know, Nextcloud looks at the Date for modification. If this is different it syncs.

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
1.So <https://1.So> <https://1.So <https://1.So> > if I understand this correctly, the notification saying the element is blocked shows up and it should not?
I would check the Reports and Analysis Section- Content Aware reports- and see the triggered element.
Also, if the pop ups are annoying, you can simply disable them


2.I understand, I think the issue.So <https://issue.So> <https://issue.So <https://issue.So> > it applies the policy only for the first time of that file, but then if the file is changed/edited the policy is not applying anymore? I am not sure exactly how Nextcloud is operating.Is <https://operating.Is> <https://operating.Is <https://operating.Is> > encryption involved? Also is it inspecting the headers?
For instance, our DPI setting if active, it enables a proxy server, which scans for content. Now if other solutions, like other proxies,antivirus, firewalls, etc are scanning the traffic too, our DPI setting no longer scans it, so a quick question here. Is the DPI active?Do they use proxies, firewalls, etc, anything that could scan traffic?
If they do, and DPI was active, they might want to enable Stealthy DPI option from Global settings.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BNgRj:ref



Good Morning,



1. In the attachments is our CopyPastePolicy

We configured the policy, so we can copy and paste in visual studio but not in a web browser.

This works fine.

The only issue we have is the Block notification we get by every Copy action. Even when its not blocked.





2. When Nextcloud sees a new File and Uploads it. The Policy works fine.

The problem comes when a new file is not blocked and Nextcloud uploads this.

After the Upload we can change the file and put sourcecode in it. ( a simple .txt)

The next time Nextcloud synchronise the file it is not blocked and the modified version with sourcecode has left the network.

Andre Tinnemann

Hi Javier,

1.I would advise the customer to check our manual, located here- https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf <https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf>
page 82/299 chapter 6.3.2.3 on CLipboard functionality. For instance, the Source code option monitored the COpy and Paste operations.That should answer their question.
2. We monitoring the upload of files, so data egress(leaving the network).I am not sure at what stag this is occurring during the synchronization/when it takes place.If this is during the data egress/upload, then yes, the policy should apply on the selected exit points.Files, depending on how the policy was setup are inspected as file type-if selected in the CAP policy, or/and it insepects the data it contains. If more info is needed on this second topic, I would like some screenshots, just to see how their policy was set up.

Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hi Adrian

When I change the file name he blocks it and even delete the old file from the server. (without forced Sync)
But I realised something different.
The normal natural synchronisation from Nextcloud is stopped by Endpoint Protector and is not synced even an hour later.
Now when I use the forced synchronisation Nextcloud ignores Endpoint Protector and all code will be uploaded.
Even the file which I renamed before and was deleted.

Kind regards
Andre Tinnemann

Good Morning Adrian,

we also use Nextcloud client version 3.13.2
At the moment we don't have a licence to test this.

We postponed to buy, because of this issue with Nextcloud.

Hi Andre,

I do have some updates.

They managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected.
Next, they enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.


The only aspect that they would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.


In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, they will prepare a test build with some additional logs.


For testing, they used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version are you testing with?

Good Morning Adrian,



I don't see a difference with the denied file location.



I couldn't add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
Can you please reach out for a license extension to your account manager/sales person please?
In order to test the below proposed scenario, you will indeed need the  license extended.

Good Morning Adrian,

we also use Nextcloud client version 3.13.2
At the moment we don't have a licence to test this.

We postponed to buy, because of this issue with Nextcloud.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I do have some updates.

They managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected.
Next, they enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.


The only aspect that they would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.


In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, they will prepare a test build with some additional logs.


For testing, they used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version are you testing with?

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your email.
I have raised up the case internally, and I managed to get the logs as well.
I will get back with more updates, once available,however as mentioned, do please note that this will take some time.
Thank you for your patience meanwhile!

Good Morning Adrian,



I don't see a difference with the denied file location.



I couldn't add the log files to the e-mail so I uploaded it to our File Transfer

I hope this works for you
