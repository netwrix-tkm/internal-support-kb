There is a policy called 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' in CAP. Currently, I understand that 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' has been changed to a 'Windows APP'. However, even though there is only 'Microsoft Remote Desktop', if I check to block 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' in CAP, will the 'Windows APP' still be blocked by the same policy?

I am currently testing the blocking policy for 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' on a Mac, but it seems that the blocking is not working.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-24T04:57:23.000Z"
