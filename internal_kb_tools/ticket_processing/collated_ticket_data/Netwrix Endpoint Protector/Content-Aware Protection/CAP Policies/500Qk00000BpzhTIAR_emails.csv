Thank you for your email.
I have performed a follow-up on this matter and I will add the conclusion below:

Currently it is not possible to configure EPP to work as requested by the customer. Logging all the activities from that location is possible, having file trace for network shares enabled. The customer can also block entirely USB devices, so no files will be transferred, but it can't block files transferred to USB devices from one location and allow from a different one. You can only block entirely that location.
There is no such feature request logged at this time and no such operation is logged for the roadmap.
