we are unable to send reply emails, it's blocking by EPP we are getting CAP reports due to haskell type it's blocking, please do the needful here.

Regards,
Sai","","In our remote session yesterday we went over the configurations for Content Aware Protection policies and confirmed that the configurations were correct for the customer's use case of blocking sensitive information via file uploads and clipboard.  I noticed that the Endpoint Client service stopped running for some reason and I restarted the service manually via CLI in terminal, the CAP policy was usefully enforced after the restart of the EPP service.

For Block and Remediation we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally.","For Block and Remediation we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally, I have tested the scenario within our test environment and the below is the feedback.

In order for the remediation to work the customer would need to turn of the paste restriction options under ""Clipboard"", these would be the last two options shown in the screenshot.  We asked the customer to modify the Clipboard switches to be identical to what is shown in the below screenshot and then to retest the scenario and see if they are able to remediate the Clipboard action as shown in the below screenshot.

The customer would need to let us know the outcome after the modification to Clipboard in the Content Aware Protection policy.","Client confirmed that the case can be resolved.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","29.4","Closed - Resolved","Satcom Infotech","Sai Nachiappan","2025-02-26T04:32:34.000Z","2025-03-27T15:03:22.000Z"
