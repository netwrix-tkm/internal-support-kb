Currently it is not possible to configure EPP to work as requested by the customer. Logging all the activities from that location is possible, having file trace for network shares enabled. The customer can also block entirely USB devices, so no files will be transferred, but it can't block files transferred to USB devices from one location and allow from a different one. They can block entirely that location, but they don't want this. They can submit a feature request, but to be honest, I don't think we will implement something like this (if it is even possible)
