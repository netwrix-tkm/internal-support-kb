"500Qk00000MHAUaIAP","00436890","Support Ticket","Unable to monitor file transfer through mobaxterm application","Unable to monitor file transfer through mobaxterm application","","Customer reported that Endpoint Protector is not enforcing the CAP policy on the mobaxterm application, specifically
 to report on file transfers. Operating System is Windows with EPP Client version 6.2.4.2000


2025.03.11 Update:
Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.","I requested a remote session with one of the affected users so that we can test the scenario in call and collect a set of logs if unresolved.

2025.04.16:
I have sent our customer a follow up email to get a status update.

Customer agreed that case can be closed but asked for a feature request to have the application name shown under ""Details"" column of Content Aware Report instead of the protocol name.","Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).
