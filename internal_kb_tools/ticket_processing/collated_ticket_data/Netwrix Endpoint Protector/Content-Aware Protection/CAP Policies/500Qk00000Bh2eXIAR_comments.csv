Hi @Alin Anca,

I hope you are well.

The issue has been tracked under https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/345259.
Currently, there is a fix in place which is already available, and also, back end procedure #62 from this Google Doc, explains how this fix can be manually applied.

I hope this helps.

Please let me know if I can further assist.

regards,
Cristi
