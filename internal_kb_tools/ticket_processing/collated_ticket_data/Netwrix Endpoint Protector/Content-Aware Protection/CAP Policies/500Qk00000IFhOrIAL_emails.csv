Would it be possible to enable the debug option on a computer and try to reproduce this to collect a set of Epp client logs?
It would help to know what was accessed when the log was generated.

Hello,

We've asked customer to enable the Debug mode, but these events are not common, and it could be difficult to catch the useful events.

Hi,

Customer said that currently this issue is observed on the Ubuntu Linux endpoints.
Also, almost all computers only have 1 such event in reports, that is why I think collecting logs in this case is not quite possible.


Best regards,

The event you mention does it appear at a specific time during the day? Or after starting the computer?

Hello,

Customer cannot find a matching between this event and specific time.
Also, this issue is not happening just after starting the computer.
Customer will try to enable logs, but seems this event appears only once for one computer.
