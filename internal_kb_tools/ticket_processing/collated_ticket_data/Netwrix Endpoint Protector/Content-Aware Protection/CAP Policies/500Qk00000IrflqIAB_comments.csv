For the block Git workflow to work, the customer should uncheck the ""Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications"" setting from their DPI policy.

We will try to provide a fix for the issue, but until then the above mentioned workaround should address this customer's concerns.

The explanation for the encountered behavior is that ""Muhammad"" is using Git with a different SSL back-end then ""Naveen"" and our DPI certificate is not recognized as trusted, thus triggering a DPI bypass action on the git upload operation.

The customer sent us this feedback:

""As suggested, I unchecked the option ""Bypass DPI Certificate Rejection by Third-Party Applications"". After doing this, it began blocking ""Github"" while allowing ""Gitlab"" for Muhammad. I tested this with a few other users and observed the same behavior. For the Mac users, however, the issue persists.

 
Unfortunately, I noticed another new issue which I see only after the version upgrade. Before the version upgrade, file creation/deletion on GitHub was also getting blocked (Refer to the video uploaded already), which is part of our requirement. But, now creating/deleting a file on GitHub is possible, only upload is getting blocked.
 

To test I tried with the older version of the agent (6.2.3.0064), but no luck. I believe this is happening only after this server version upgrade. If this cannot block creating/deleting on GitHub, users will be able to just copy and paste the confidential information on GitHub which again makes the security policy ineffective.

Also, as you mentioned, I use ""git.avrioc.io,"" while Muhammad uses ""gitlab.avrioc.io."" Therefore, it is expected that we notice different SSL certificates. However, the allowlist includes ""*.avrioc.io,"" which should permit both ""Git"" and ""GitLab"" as part of avrioc.io. I don't believe the SSL certificate is the issue.

Because the customer complained about the macOS build, there is also a test build for macOS with the mentioned fix for git uploads:

_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2025-builds/2025_01_14/EppMac_v3.0.4.0020

As for their statement:

tell them to re-test the scenario with the new build and collect the logs while they are trying the scenario. We need: eppclient.log, eppsslsplit.log, reprovision.db, options.ini and netdlp_settings.json.

On macOS, to achieve what they want, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.

FYI @WaitingOnEngineer 


The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

> However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.""

Either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if they're using multiple CAP policies, they need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.

To continue they can send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

Another option to speed this up would be to organize a remote connection with a developer so we can see for ourselves and troubleshoot on the spot.

Hi André,
As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.
During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option.

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

Thank you!

@WaitingOnEngineer

Andre, since @Robert Zavalczki is off this week, @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan asked me to take a look at the logs received. I do not know what exactly happened in the remote session, but I can explain what I see in the logs right now and what I understand from the last comment:

	 - 	at least for debugging purposes, we could ask the customer to stick to only 1-2 CAP policies. It is harder to follow the logs when over 20 policies are loaded 
	 - 	the eppsslsplit.log file is not very helpful, it seems it was collected over a very short period of time and I don't see anything related to github.com in it (or anything git related) 
	 - 	since I was not in the remote session, I can only suspect that you enabled and disabled Intercept VPN a couple of times, is that correct? 
	 - 	in the eppclient.log file I see that full disk access is not granted to the EPP client. Sure, this does not cause the reported issue, but the customer should take care of this also 
	 - 	I see in the logs also that github.com was blocked, I suppose this was expected. And yes, it seems that Intercept VPN was disabled at that moment. In fact, it seems that Intercept VPN was initially enabled. After that, in a time frame of about 30 seconds, Intercept VPN was disabled, github.com was blocked and Intercept VPN was enabled back. Does this sound right?  
	 - 	Andre, when Intercept VPN is enabled/disabled, sslsplit is restarted and logs recorded in eppsslsplit.log prior to this are flushed. Probably after the last enable of Intercept VPN the scenario with github.com was not tested. If that's the case, we will probably need another set of logs, with this recorded 
	 - 	if by any chance you concluded in the remote session that the only option for the customer is to disable Intercept VPN, we can skip the above point, with collecting new logs. But I don't know what we can answer to the customer, we can't test because we don't have his environment. Intercept VPN is needed mostly when the customer has also other software that could interfere with the EPP client (VPNs or other software that performs network inspection). I think that best if for the customer to check. But as long as we recommended in the past to enable it, they probably need it enabled.

Thank you for your feedback.

The purpose of the call was to check and see why the test build [ EPP macOS v3.0.4.0020 Notarized ] does not enforce DPI Allowed / Denied Domains for github actions (cloning) via terminal and then also to collect a new set of logs if the changes that we made did not resolve the issue.  The customer wants only their custom avrioc github domain to be allowed and the default github.com domain should be blocked via terminal when performing github actions (cloning)


- at least for debugging purposes, we could ask the customer to stick to only 1-2 CAP policies. It is harder to follow the logs when over 20 policies are loaded
- the eppsslsplit.log file is not very helpful, it seems it was collected over a very short period of time and I don't see anything related to github.com in it (or anything git related)

- since I was not in the remote session, I can only suspect that you enabled and disabled Intercept VPN a couple of times, is that correct?

A:
Yes, we reinstalled the EPP client and we tested the scenario.  Strangely the CAP policy worked as expected only when Intercept VPN was turned off.  When it was turned on then the github domain was not blocked as expected.

- in the eppclient.log file I see that full disk access is not granted to the EPP client. Sure, this does not cause the reported issue, but the customer should take care of this also

A:
Yes the customer is aware, we did point this out to him in our session.  This happened because of the reinstallation of the EPP test build. But the main purpose of the call was to test and see why EPP does not block github,com actions when cloning via terminal.

- I see in the logs also that github.com was blocked, I suppose this was expected. And yes, it seems that Intercept VPN was disabled at that moment. In fact, it seems that Intercept VPN was initially enabled. After that, in a time frame of about 30 seconds, Intercept VPN was disabled, github.com was blocked and Intercept VPN was enabled back. Does this sound right?

A:
Yes that is correct, the CAP policy was enforced correctly when Intercept VPN was turned off.

- Andre, when Intercept VPN is enabled/disabled, sslsplit is restarted and logs recorded in eppsslsplit.log prior to this are flushed. Probably after the last enable of Intercept VPN the scenario with github.com was not tested. If that's the case, we will probably need another set of logs, with this recorded

A:
Okay, I understand.  I think Robert made a note or there was something specific he wanted to capture with the test build.

- if by any chance you concluded in the remote session that the only option for the customer is to disable Intercept VPN, we can skip the above point, with collecting new logs. But I don't know what we can answer to the customer, we can't test because we don't have his environment.

I think that best if for the customer to check. But as long as we recommended in the past to enable it, they probably need it enabled.

A:
Yes they need Intercept VPN to be enabled in order to correctly enforce all CAP policies.  I think Robert was in the process of investigating how to make the EPP client enforce DPI, Allowed / Denied domains for github actions via terminal while having Intercept VPN turned on.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-21T17:01:34.000Z","2025-02-21T17:01:34.000Z","false","false"

""
Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected.

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.
Kindly look into it and let us know.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.

This Git is an unsigned application. As far as I know the network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation known by us.

As a workaround the customer can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.

I will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes, and comment here if I find a solution. FYI @WaitingOnEngineer

Last time we investigated this there was no way to obtain the process name or full path for unsigned processes in our network extension.

We want to thank our customer for testing for us.

The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up at our customer, and because of their help we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build:

_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2025-builds/2025_03_18/EppMac_v3.0.5.0002

that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting. FYI @WaitingOnEngineer
