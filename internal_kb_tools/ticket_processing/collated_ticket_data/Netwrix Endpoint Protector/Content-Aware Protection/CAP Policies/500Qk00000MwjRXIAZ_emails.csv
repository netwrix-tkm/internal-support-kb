Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we identified the issue for the large amount of logs containing files that did not contain PII information, it was the fact that file types(Office and text) were also selected. This causes that all files of those file types to be reported and/or blocked from being uploaded, no matter if they contain PII or not. If you remove the file types and only leave the PII information selected then it will pick-up every file containing PII no matter the file type it is in.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we identified the issue for the large amount of logs containing files that did not contain PII information, it was the fact that file types(Office and text) were also selected. This causes that all files of those file types to be reported and/or blocked from being uploaded, no matter if they contain PII or not. If you remove the file types and only leave the PII information selected then it will pick-up every file containing PII no matter the file type it is in.

Please let me know if we can close this ticket.
