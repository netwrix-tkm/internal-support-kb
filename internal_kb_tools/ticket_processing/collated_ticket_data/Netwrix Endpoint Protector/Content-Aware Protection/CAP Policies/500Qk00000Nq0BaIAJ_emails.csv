My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case.

You can find the OCR settings from Device Control -> Global Settings page. Look for Optical Character Recognition and also Disable OCR notifications. 



Also, OCR settings can be found in Device Control -> Computers, Select computer, then under Actions, select Manage Settings.



From here, check for Optical Character Recognition and Disable OCR notifications. 



Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you.
