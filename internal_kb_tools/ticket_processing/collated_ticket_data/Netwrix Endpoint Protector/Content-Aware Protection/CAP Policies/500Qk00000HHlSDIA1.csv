Customer name is VIP-RENT.
They report that they get many false positives in CAP events related to MS documents.
For example, CAP policy was triggered on the Network Share file transfer with matched items ""phone number"".
But if customer will check this .xls file, it has no any phone numbers, or even the numbers found by EPP.
We tried to disable Metadata Scanning to see if it helps and waiting for the results.
Could you please suggest what else can provide these false positives?
I will attach a set of logs:","","Customer name is VIP-RENT.
They report that they get many false positives in CAP events related to some documents, I have attached those documents to the ticket.
These false positives are referring to credit-card_maestro, credit-card_visa and id_ua.","Test with QA","No feedback from the customer.","Root Cause Unknown","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","137.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-10-21T14:52:47.000Z","2025-03-07T14:43:12.000Z"
