No issue here, that is the expected behavior, this escalation can be closed.
Please check also the EPP Manual/Documentation, to my knowledge we have some examples there of how filename blacklist works. Shortly, one doesn't need wildcard added at all, just the name (or partial name). If the transferred filename is my_test_example.txt, one can block this by using in the Denylist any of these: ""txt"", "".txt"", ""example.txt"", ""test_example.txt"", etc. There is no option to block it using ""test"" in the Filename Denylist. Still, if the customer insists on a solution, this can be achieved by adding ""test"" in the Predefined Content tab. The EPP client scans also filenames and theoretically it will block if ""test"" is added in the dictionary.¬†

Thank you for the the customer was advised that they could use custom content as it applies for file names as well as content - This works.

However to point out that the example for File Name according to the examples shown in EPP UI and also instructions on the user Manual; is that if you input only the name ""Example"" then it should intercept file names like ""Example.pdf"" and ""Example together with any other extension.  But entering only the name does not work.

In the test which I conducted it did not intercept ""Example"" with extensions, it is only when the extensions are included under deny lists then only EPP intercepts file name like ""Example.xxx""

The partner also pointed this out.   Please see the screenshots which I have uploaded.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-08-07T11:00:21.000Z","2024-08-07T11:00:21.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer¬†I see only one screenshot and I don't know what I should look for there. Anyway, please point me, or even better send me a screenshot with the documentation where you found the example you mentioned. I don't know where you've found it, it might be a wrong explanation there, but I can assure you that this feature was designed and works the way I mentioned and there is no issue here.¬†

I think what the partner and myself is pointing out is that it is not working according to the samples shown and given.  When you enter only the name then it does not intercept the file transfer.

I uploaded a zip archive ""File_Name_Denylist_samples.zip"" here: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00416860

The zip archive contains the screenshots as well as the sample file that you can download from the EPP appliance when you click on the ""Download sample file"".  According to the User manual, samples shown and give in the EPP Console it says that you can input only the name of the file without the extension.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-08-08T07:27:09.000Z","2024-08-08T07:27:09.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer¬†

Hi Andre,

Yes, there is a sample file to upload there, it has some examples in it. But that one doesn't mention anything about what are the files you are testing with, which will be blocked and which will not be blocked. Am I right? You can have a filename, without extension, named just simple ""example"".

You've provided me a screenshot with an explanation that you've highlighted. Right under that one, there is this sentence: ""You can deÔ¨Åne the content by adding the Ô¨Ålename and extension, or just the extension.""

This is the most important part üòä You can either use just the extension, or filename and extension. Only the filename does not work. If the customer is not OK with this, please raise a feature request or something like this. There is nothing I can do here right now.¬†
