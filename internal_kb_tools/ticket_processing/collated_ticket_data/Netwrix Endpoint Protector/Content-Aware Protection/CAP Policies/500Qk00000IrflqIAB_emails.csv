I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Dear Naveen,

Our R&D team have prepared a new test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"", could you please download and install this build and retest the scenario for the GitHub use case.

Please use the following link to download the test build:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp28022025/EPPMac3.0.4.0035.Notarized.tar

This build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"" contains a fix for the issue that was happening when the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" was set to on.

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

 

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

 

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for clarifying, that script you can download here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_files/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

However, the test build which we provided to you is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I asked about the script that was given to push along with the packages from the MDM during global installation.

Hi Andre,

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

We will be awaiting your response.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected.

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

[cid:image001.png@01DB932F.684A08F0]

Kindly look into it and let us know.

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Dear Andre,

Retesting the scenario with the given test build, we were able to achieve the GitHub use case with the Mac.

Thanks!

Hi André,

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

[cid:image007.png@01DB932F.684A08F0]

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option.

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for clarifying, that script you can download here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_files/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

However, the test build which we provided to you is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre, 

 

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

 

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

 

We will be awaiting your response.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

 

[Inline image name : image001.png]

 

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image007.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?

Kind regards

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

 

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

 

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for clarifying, that script you can download here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_files/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

However, the test build which we provided to you is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

We will be awaiting your response.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected.

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9732.24CFD1C0]

Kindly look into it and let us know.

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Hi André,

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9732.24CFD1C0]

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option.

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

Thank you!




Best Regards,

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for clarifying, that script you can download here: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_files/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

However, the test build which we provided to you is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

 

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre, 

 

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

 

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

 

We will be awaiting your response.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

 

[Inline image name : image007.png]

 

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image008.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

 

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

 

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

 

Thanks!

Thank you for testing the build and providing us your valuable feedback.  The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up within your environment and because of your help in testing we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting.

Please use the following link to download the test build ""EPPMac v3.0.5.0002"":
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19032025/EPPMac3.0.5.0002.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

 

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Hi Andre, 

 

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

 

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

 

We will be awaiting your response.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

 

[Inline image name : image007.png]

 

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image008.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

 

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

 

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

 

Thanks!

I tested the new build on multiple Mac machines. It is working fine now, as expected GitHub is blocked.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for testing the build and providing us your valuable feedback.  The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up within your environment and because of your help in testing we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting.

Please use the following link to download the test build ""EPPMac v3.0.5.0002"":
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19032025/EPPMac3.0.5.0002.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Hi Andre,

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

We will be awaiting your response.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected.

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9D75.54311980]

Kindly look into it and let us know.

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Hi André,

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9D75.54311980]

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option.

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I understand this is a test build, so manual intervention is required.

The test build has been installed on one of the Macs, and it appears online in the EPP Console. However, none of the policies are being applied to the user or the machine.

Let's schedule a quick call to troubleshoot this issue, preferably today. I will be available between 11:00 AM and 05:00 PM GST.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for testing the build and providing us your valuable feedback.  The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up within your environment and because of your help in testing we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting.

Please use the following link to download the test build ""EPPMac v3.0.5.0002"":
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19032025/EPPMac3.0.5.0002.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

 

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre, 

 

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

 

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

 

We will be awaiting your response.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Dear Naveen,

Our R&D team have prepared a new test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"", could you please download and install this build and retest the scenario for the GitHub use case.

Please use the following link to download the test build:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp28022025/EPPMac3.0.4.0035.Notarized.tar

This build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"" contains a fix for the issue that was happening when the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" was set to on.

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image008.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?

Kind regards

Hi Marian,

As the issue related to GitHub is resolved now, this can be closed.

However, we have also highlighted a few more challenges while opening this case. We shall create separate tickets for them if required.

Thanks!

Hello Naveen,

Thank you very much for the confirmation.

I am glad to hear that Github can be blocked accordingly now. Let me know if you have further questions or if it's ok to close the incident.

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for testing the build and providing us your valuable feedback.  The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up within your environment and because of your help in testing we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting.

Please use the following link to download the test build ""EPPMac v3.0.5.0002"":
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19032025/EPPMac3.0.5.0002.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Hi Andre,

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

We will be awaiting your response.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected.

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9E34.8D8D7E70]

Kindly look into it and let us know.

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?


Kind regards

Hi André,

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9E34.8D8D7E70]

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option.

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you that our R&D team provided on this case.

On macOS, to achieve the requirement to block a domain while allowing another, the customer should uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" application from the Content Aware Protection policy.
The explanation for the experienced behavior is that the ""GitHub Client"" application is not controlled using Deep Packet Inspection, and on macOS the process names associated with the ""GitHub Client"" app include also the process names of the Git command line tools.

Can we ask you to uncheck the ""Github Client"" from the CAP exit points and then retest the scenario on macOS and let us know the outcome please?


Kind regards

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for testing the build and providing us your valuable feedback.  The test build 3.0.4.0038 contained a bug that only showed up within your environment and because of your help in testing we were able to fix it. We prepared a new test build that should work in this case with the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" setting.

Please use the following link to download the test build ""EPPMac v3.0.5.0002"":
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19032025/EPPMac3.0.5.0002.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Further, while testing with the new test build, I noticed it is blocking git actions on all the domains (including the allowed ones). Also, when I tried the git actions with Intercept VPN option disabled, it is allowing all the domains. This behaviour is something new, with the old version it worked (allowed only on required domains) when the Intercept VPN option was disabled.

 

I’ve uploaded the logs to the support portal for your reference. Please check them and let us know.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your feedback.  I have also received additional feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

The discovered bug in this case with our network extension in which it couldn't identify unsigned applications run from non-standard locations is fixed the test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized"".  You can download this test build by following the below link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp12032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0038.Notarized.tar

Can we ask you to please uninstall the existing client and install this build, retest the scenario on the 3rd mac and provide us your feedback?

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Kind regards

Hi Andre, 

 

I believe even for the first 2 MAC devices, it was Homebrew. Please revalidate them once again.

 

We already have signed software packages for Git. Since homebrew is native package manager users find it more convenient than the third-party software packages. Hence, we should restrict them.

 

We will be awaiting your response.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I would like to relay feedback to you from our R&D team.

The difference between the third mac (where the Git blocking doesn't work) and the other two is that on the third mac the user uses the Git application provided by the ""Homebrew"" package manager for macOS.  This Git is an unsigned application. The EPP network extension is not able to get the process names / identifiers for unsigned applications and this is a limitation.

As a workaround you can ensure that Git is installed from a signed software package such as Xcode.  We will investigate if there is something we can do in the network extension to be able to identify unsigned processes and then notify you if we find a solution.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I’m doing well and thanks. I hope you are also doing well.

 

Initially, I checked on 2 Mac and it worked fine as expected. 

 

Today, I tested with another Mac and observed the same issue we noticed during the call (Turning off the Intercept VPN is blocking the GitHub). Tried multiple times on the same Mac, unfortunately, the issue persists.

 

Furthermore, I have collected logs from that Mac host and uploaded them to the support portal for your reference.

Kindly look into it and let us know. 

 

Thanks!

Dear Naveen,

I trust you are well.  I wanted to follow up on this case since your last update as I was out of office.  Did you test the build one multiple macOS endpoints? if yes, may we proceed to the closure of this case now?

Kind regards

Retesting the scenario with the given test build, we were able to achieve the GitHub use case with the Mac.

Dear Naveen,

Our R&D team have prepared a new test build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"", could you please download and install this build and retest the scenario for the GitHub use case.

Please use the following link to download the test build:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp28022025/EPPMac3.0.4.0035.Notarized.tar

This build ""EPPMac3.0.4.0035"" contains a fix for the issue that was happening when the ""Intercept VPN Traffic"" was set to on.

Important Note:

Hi André,

 

As requested, I’ve attached the logs from yesterday’s testing. Please refer to the image below.

 

[Inline image name : image008.png]

 

During testing, we found that the policy functioned correctly after disabling the Intercept VPN option. 

 

In the past, your support team has suggested enabling the “Intercept VPN Option” when we had issues uploading files on MS Teams. Hence, we are hesitant to disable this setting, as we are concerned it may lead to new issues.

 

We would like to request that you test this in your environment and provide us with your feedback. Post that we will implement any changes based on your suggestions.

 

Thank you!

Hi Andre,

As I have already mentioned and tested during our call, the “GitHub Client” from the list of applications is not checked in any of our policies. Only “Git” under source code is selected and the same works well for Windows but not for Mac.

 

I’m available on Wednesday 12-02-2025 between 02:30 PM to 05:00 PM, please feel free to schedule between the same if that suits you.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I have received feedback from our developer assigned to this case.

Unchecking the ""GitHub Client"" from the list of applications will solve this issue. It is either the setting change did not reach the EPP agent or, if you're using multiple CAP policies, you need to make sure to uncheck the ""GitHub Client"" from all policies assigned to the user or computer.
To continue they please send new logs including the ""reprovision.db"" and ""option.ini"" files so we can confirm that the ""GitHub Client"" application name is still received from the server.

I will propose that we have another remote session with one of our developers joining in, please let  me know your available hours for tomorrow and Wednesday.

Kind regards

Hi Andre,

I already tested both ways by selecting the “GitHub Client” and unselecting it. However, I retested it again, still didn’t work.
