@WaitingOnEngineer 


Hi Ramon, can you please give more information about the customer's problem. They state that they are blocked, but ""the files in question are still being delivered to the targeted recipients.""

1. If the files are delivered, why they say that they are blocked? Don't they want to see the pop-up similar to the attached 'Blend DLP Warning.png'?

2. If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. In this case I receive notifications with an icon containing a white x in a red circle. Are they referring to this when they refer to block?

Maybe their issue is complete different. A recording or screenshot may also help.

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi,

the customer initially stated, that they are ""blocked"", despite having a report only policy in use. The logs from 5th March show no blocking, the attached screenshot 'Blend DLP Warning.png' is just a notification that a threat is detected and reported. They also confirmed that the files in question were delivered. I see no issue here.

Regarding the new screenshots:
'Blend DLP Warning.png', 'Outlook Blend DLP Warning.png' - see above, they are normal, expected notifications
'Windows Error.png' - not Endpoint Protector related
'Override.png', 'EPP User remediation.png' - these screenshots belong to a ""Block and remediate"" policy. The description is about ""Report only policies"".
'EPP UI.png' - this contains log reports from a computer called DESKTOP-ML3HQ86 (if I read it properly), but none of the attached logs belong to this computer.

The logs uploaded on 13th March contain a ""Block only"" policy. The description is about report only policies.

Please make sure the customer understands how our product works, and clarify what is the problem, if there is one.
If there are multiple issues, please group the questions, logs, screenshots, recordings properly.
