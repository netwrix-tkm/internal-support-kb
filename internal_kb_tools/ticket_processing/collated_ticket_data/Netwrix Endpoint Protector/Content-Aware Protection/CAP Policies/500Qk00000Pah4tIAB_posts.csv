A customer with a trial console is facing issue where the destination shows the recepients and a lot of other unnecesary data. The entry is as follows : 
O=EXCHANGELABS/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=56BD6A6D0A844B9793073724BA2E7098-7586EFF5-21;/o=ExchangeLabs/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=e8f26e57267f4c978728705d1729d5ff-PPC20230828;<a href='https://ram.venkat@azista-aeg.com' target='_blank'>ram.venkat@azista-aeg.com</a>;<a href='https://harikrishna.vs@azistaindustries.com' target='_blank'>harikrishna.vs@azistaindustries.com</a>;<a href='https://murari.kasireddy@azista-aeg.com' target='_blank'>murari.kasireddy@azista-aeg.com</a>;/o=ExchangeLabs/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=d1ac1fd42ef54318b03119929aa0bfd2-Purchase202

It makes the report difficult for the customer to read. Can you please let me know how we can only have the email IDs mentioned instead of the additional details ?
