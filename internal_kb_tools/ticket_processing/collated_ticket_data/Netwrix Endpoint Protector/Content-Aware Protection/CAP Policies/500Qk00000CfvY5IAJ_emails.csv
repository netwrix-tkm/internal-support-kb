For the first topic, we suggest creating a contextual detection to ignore the word ""confidential"" if it's in the proximity of words like ""best regards"" or ""best wishes"".
You can read more about this in the manual, in chapter 17.2:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf

Regarding the second topic, please try to enable Stealthy DPI for Windows, or Intercept VPN Traffic on Mac, for a few computers to see if this helps with the issue, from Device Control -> Computers, and select the computers on which you can test this out.

If you need more help, please let me know and we can schedule a remote session.

Hi Tiago,

I did some testing of this setting using Escale’s email signature, and this is how I managed to get it to work --

Under System Configuration -> System Parameters -> click Add -> configure it as per below screenshot.
The “email signature” is a Custom Content denylist dictionary that includes the word “acidental” from the signature. You can add it under Denylists and Allowlists -> Denylists -> Custom Content -> Add. Please make sure you have this dictionary created already prior to creating this Contextual Detection Rule.


[cid:image001.png@01DACEE1.BBAEA7C0]

After the rule is configured and saved, please click the “Generate” button. Then, please scroll up the page and enable Contextual Detection, as per below:

[cid:image002.png@01DACEE2.4B9F1AE0]

What this means is that if a file or an email body contains the word “CONFIDENCIAL”, but in the proximity of 3000 characters it also has the word “acidental”, it will not trigger the policy.

Please make sure there are no Content Aware Policies in place that use individual Context Detection rules, as this global configuration won’t work if that’s the case.

Please let us know if it worked.

Thanks,
Natalie

Thanks for reply!

From the first option OK, I plan to make this, just to confirm.

However, in the second option, I had already done this, and it had no effect or improvements, it continues to insist insistently and annoyingly alert you when the document is open with each new ""auto-save"" as you work on the document throughout the day, more details below:

      2. Google Drive: When working on a file for a long time, the tool prompts you for the justification screen.
      What is the best way and definitive alternative for COSOSYS for this situation?
     Explanation: In this case, when we use Google Drive and the Google platform's online office tools to edit documents through the platform's office applications, the DLP application records continuous hits of upload violations throughout the document editing, either for some minutes or throughout the working day.

We would like to avoid this insistent and constant identification in our documents that are hosted on our Google platform, or a better way to improve the user interface/interaction.

Hi Tiago,



I did some testing of this setting using Escale’s email signature, and this is how I managed to get it to work --



Under System Configuration -> System Parameters -> click Add -> configure it as per below screenshot.

The “email signature” is a Custom Content denylist dictionary that includes the word “acidental” from the signature. You can add it under Denylists and Allowlists -> Denylists -> Custom Content -> Add. Please make sure you have this dictionary created already prior to creating this Contextual Detection Rule.





[cid:904a2891-82be-4a71-8a0e-d3d9be192d8c@Image_5_]



After the rule is configured and saved, please click the “Generate” button. Then, please scroll up the page and enable Contextual Detection, as per below:



[cid:1d34f638-2803-401e-93c6-009945499227@Image_6_]



What this means is that if a file or an email body contains the word “CONFIDENCIAL”, but in the proximity of 3000 characters it also has the word “acidental”, it will not trigger the policy.



Please make sure there are no Content Aware Policies in place that use individual Context Detection rules, as this global configuration won’t work if that’s the case.



Please let us know if it worked.



Thanks,

Natalie

Hi Tiago,

For the first topic, we suggest creating a contextual detection to ignore the word ""confidential"" if it's in the proximity of words like ""best regards"" or ""best wishes"".
You can read more about this in the manual, in chapter 17.2:
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf

Regarding the second topic, please try to enable Stealthy DPI for Windows, or Intercept VPN Traffic on Mac, for a few computers to see if this helps with the issue, from Device Control -> Computers, and select the computers on which you can test this out.

If you need more help, please let me know and we can schedule a remote session.

Hi Tiago,

1. That is correctly set up.

2. For this, you could set up an Allowed Google Business account, but by doing this, google documents will not be scanned


Alternatively, you can create a DPI allowlist, but again, the documents will not be scanned.

Hi Tiago,

1. That is correctly set up.

2. For this, you could set up an Allowed Google Business account, but by doing this, google documents will not be scanned


Alternatively, you can create a DPI allowlist, but again, the documents will not be scanned.

Hi team,

I make changes....


For the first topic, we suggest creating a contextual detection to ignore the word ""confidential"" if it's in the proximity of words like ""best regards"" or ""best wishes"".

The default email signature is:

[CONFIDENCIAL]
As informações deste e-mail são estritamente confidenciais e destinadas apenas ao destinatário. Em caso de recebimento acidental não divulgue notifique o remetente salve ou faça cópias do e-mail ou anexos.



  1.
Create a Rule



Its correct?? This is all??? Only this???




Update for second suggestion...
Regarding the second topic, please try to enable Stealthy DPI for Windows, or Intercept VPN Traffic on Mac, for a few computers to see if this helps with the issue, from Device Control -> Computers, and select the computers on which you can test this out.
This configuration had already been done in the past, for all machines it is already in this configuration in the global rule.







Atenciosamente,

Hi Tiago,



I did some testing of this setting using Escale’s email signature, and this is how I managed to get it to work --



Under System Configuration -> System Parameters -> click Add -> configure it as per below screenshot.

The “email signature” is a Custom Content denylist dictionary that includes the word “acidental” from the signature. You can add it under Denylists and Allowlists -> Denylists -> Custom Content -> Add. Please make sure you have this dictionary created already prior to creating this Contextual Detection Rule.







After the rule is configured and saved, please click the “Generate” button. Then, please scroll up the page and enable Contextual Detection, as per below:





What this means is that if a file or an email body contains the word “CONFIDENCIAL”, but in the proximity of 3000 characters it also has the word “acidental”, it will not trigger the policy.



Please make sure there are no Content Aware Policies in place that use individual Context Detection rules, as this global configuration won’t work if that’s the case.



Please let us know if it worked.



Thanks,

Natalie
