"500Qk00000KFpxxIAD","00431178","Support Ticket","User cannot attached the PNG file","we have applied only report policy but we are getting error , we have tried to attached the 10 PNG files 5 got uploaded another 5 facing issue, please do the needful.","","In our remote session we observed that when Deep Packet Inspection with ""Peer Certificate Validation"" is turned on then you are not able to reach your Kaspersky Security Centre page via the web browser, the moment we switched ""Peer Certificate Validation"" off you were able to successfully access the Kaspersky Security Centre - this was resolved in our remote session today.

For the issue reported, referred to as Point 1 ""Windows Policy Issues: The Windows policy is not functioning as expected. It is blocking attachments even though the policy is configured to allow them."" and Point 3 ""Blocked Attachments: Attachments such as .png and .jpeg files are being blocked, despite being explicitly allowed in the policy configuration.""  
For these points (tracked on this support ticket) I have opened an escalation case with our R&D team and submitted the EPP Client logs to them together with the video recording.  Our R&D team will analyze the EPP client logs and then provide feedback with next steps to take. I will give you an update on this as soon as feedback is given.

As discussed in our call today, for points 2 and 4 please open new support tickets individually for these topics.  We need to track each topic on it's own support ticket - we need these segregations to be done as tickets are individually tracked and escalated to R&D or to Management (if needed).

2025.02.14 Update:

In our remote session the customer was not able to reproduce the issue in our remote session, at the end of our call we enabled append logs in case the issue reproduced again with the test build.  In our call I asked the customer to send us the append log file, the artifact, the screenshot as well as the date and time that the incident occurred so that we can know where to look in the log files.","2025.03.10 Update:
In the last remote session that we had on the 14th February the customer was not able to reproduce the issue in our remote session, at the end of our call we enabled append logs in case the issue reproduced again with the test build.  In our call I asked the customer to send us the append log file, the artifact, the screenshot as well as the date and time that the incident occurred so that we can know where to look in the log files.  Since then we have not had any update from the customer's side.
