Hi Andre,

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,

 

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

 

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

 

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

 

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.  


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:


	Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
	Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
	Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
	Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
	Issue Start: From the beginning.


Additional Technical Details:


	Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
	OS Version: Windows 11
	Server Version: 5.9.4.1
	Platform: On-prem - ESXi
	Artifacts: Screenshot attached


Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,



The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.



In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.



Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.



Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,



The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.



In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.



Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.



Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,



The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.



In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.



Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.



Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,



The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.



In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.



Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.



Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,

 

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

 

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

 

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

 

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:


	Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
	Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
	Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
	Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
	Issue Start: From the beginning.


Additional Technical Details:


	Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
	OS Version: Windows 11
	Server Version: 5.9.4.1
	Platform: On-prem - ESXi
	Artifacts: Screenshot attached


Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.

I have done further testing within our environment and also discussed internally this scenario.

Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.

I hope this information is helpful, if you have any follow up questions then please let me know.


Kind regards

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #436890 - - Unable to monitor file transfer through mobaxterm application [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0MHAUa:ref ]

Hi Midhun, Manoj

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.

I have done further testing within our environment and also discussed internally this scenario.

Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.

I hope this information is helpful, if you have any follow up questions then please let me know.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

 

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

 

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

 

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Midhun Das

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:


	Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
	Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
	Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
	Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
	Issue Start: From the beginning.


Additional Technical Details:


	Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
	OS Version: Windows 11
	Server Version: 5.9.4.1
	Platform: On-prem - ESXi
	Artifacts: Screenshot attached


Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Andre,

 

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

 

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

 

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

 

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Midhun Das

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.  


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:


	Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
	Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
	Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
	Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
	Issue Start: From the beginning.


Additional Technical Details:


	Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
	OS Version: Windows 11
	Server Version: 5.9.4.1
	Platform: On-prem - ESXi
	Artifacts: Screenshot attached


Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Hi Midhun, Manoj

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.

I have done further testing within our environment and also discussed internally this scenario.

Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.

I hope this information is helpful, if you have any follow up questions then please let me know.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,



The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.



In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.



Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.



Request you to kindly do the needful.

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:

  1.  Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
  2.  Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
  3.  Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
  4.  Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
  5.  Issue Start: From the beginning.

Additional Technical Details:

  1.  Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
  2.  OS Version: Windows 11
  3.  Server Version: 5.9.4.1
  4.  Platform: On-prem - ESXi
  5.  Artifacts: Screenshot attached

Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.

I have done further testing within our environment and also discussed internally this scenario.

Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.

I hope this information is helpful, if you have any follow up questions then please let me know.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

The use case is to monitor file transfer through MobaXterm. We use SCP protocol to transfer the files through MobaXterm.

 

In the exit point, we selected MobaXterm as well as SCP from other applications and created report only action policy. However, we are unable to receive any logs once file is transferred.

 

Please note this is the only use case which is pending to conclude the POC.

 

Request you to kindly do the needful.

Midhun Das

Hello Noemi, Manoj, Midhun

Thank you for opening this case and also all of the details provided.  Can we have more details of how the scenario tested please? what actions were done via MobaXterm? was it only files being transmitted via MobaXterm? if yes, please provide step by step detail on how to reproduce this issue.

I would like to test the scenario in-house to observe the behavior of Endpoint Protector.  


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MHAUa:ref

Hi Andre, hi support team,

I'm writing to follow up on an issue brought up by our prospect Tayana in a call with the partner today. It seems they accidentally opened two tickets, so please refer to just this one for this issue. The other one, i.e. 00436891 I will ask to be closed as being duplicate.

Following up on the call today, we've received an update from the customer regarding the issue with MobaXterm logs not generating. They have provided additional details and a screenshot for further investigation.

Here's the information they shared:


	Impact: CAP Policy not working for the Mobaxterm application, affecting all users.
	Reproduction Steps: Both block and report actions have been tried without logs being generated.
	Troubleshooting Attempted: A policy was created, and the agent was reinstalled, but the issue persists.
	Objective: Need to monitor or report all file transfers through Mobaxterm.
	Issue Start: From the beginning.


Additional Technical Details:


	Client Version: 6.2.4.2 (Windows)
	OS Version: Windows 11
	Server Version: 5.9.4.1
	Platform: On-prem - ESXi
	Artifacts: Screenshot attached


Please look into this and advise on the next steps for resolving the issue. Let us know if additional information is needed from the customer.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Noemi
