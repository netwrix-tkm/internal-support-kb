Hey Imran,

Engineering just informed me that 375 814 356 was a mishap on their end and it should not trigger as an SIN number. The other 3 are still matching the checksum and are valid.
In light of this information, I would say it works as intended and the only way is to test with valid SIN numbers to see if they match the checksum and generate logs.
Let me know if that is possible.

Hey Imran,

That is what it triggers, and the file is set in a way to trigger it. Is the US SSN policy at a higher priority than the SIN one?

We don’t have  issue with SS  ( Social security )   ,  the test file should be tested with CAN SIN   info in it ,

 

Can I upload those test files on the Portal

Hey Imran,

In the logs I see the policy 'Print US SSN Windows' trigger for the items in the file and matching context item 'soc sec', which are present in the file.
To me this works as intended. Are the logs missing from the console?

Hey Imran,

Yes, it is regarding Canada SIN. The SSN at the top is just a remnant most likely since it is still an SSN type, just that it is for Canada.
You can copy paste the examples, you do not need to use the exact file.

Eduard ,

 

The attached file Key word says  “SSN”

 

If I print this than EPP will catch that as   US SSN   which is already working .

 

We are talking about CAN SIN

 

If I understand correctly ?

Hey Imran,

Please use the attached file to check the SIN detection. We have a checksum validation procedure that is following the Canadian format, unfortunately I cannot provide the exact validation steps, but it should work with real SIN numbers. We accept both formats ddd-ddd-ddd and ddd ddd ddd.
Please check the samples sent and let me know the outcome.

Hey Imran,

On The SIN number issue. Now that the server and agents are upgraded to the latest version, can you please test again with the file you sent over and gather some logs? Just on your machine should be more than enough.

Hi Imran,

Please find below the answers to the questions raised:

1. We would recommend upgrading the EPP server to the latest version 5941 and also using the most recent EPP client:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16122024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0041.zip
Note: Please create a Snapshot of the EPP server from the VM/AWS/Azure/GCP platform on which it is hosted, if it is hosted on your end.

2. Please test with the above mentioned client: 6.2.4.0041 as it is the most recent build. Please only use it for testing on a few test computers and do not mass deploy it. The 6.2.3.1 is a GA release client, improvements to the EPP clients are made almost daily by our devs so using the most recent test build may resolve the issue.

3. Please use the EPP client provided by my colleague Eduard for testing and let us know the outcome, after your colleagues managed to run their tests with it.

4. Our engineers and devs make new client builds almost daily with improvements and fixes. They usually test with the GA client(the one present on the EPP server) and also with the most recent test build. New functionalities or bug fixes are implemented in the new test builds and they will all be included in the next GA release client version.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello EPP ,

 

In my current client version ( 6.2.2.2005 ) I am not able to generate the CAN SSN file print job triggered at EPP console ( see the attached file ) .   I also tried to upload the same file at DLPtest.com and did not get any alert on EPP console .

 

Now few things here , 

 

1 ) Today when I open the EPP server , I am seeing this server upgrade message ( see the 1st  picture below )   So my question is , do I need to update the server  ,   before I re attempt  to perform same testing on CAN SSN  ( print or upload test ) .

 

2)   When we go to “System configuration > Client Software “  I see the client version 6.2.3.1 , So my question is , do I need to update the client to 6.2.3.1  ,   before I re attempt  to perform same testing on CAN SSN  ( print or upload test ) .

 

3)  Edward sent us new build test client 3 days back and wanted to upgrade to only few users , We are still waiting from our  EUC team to install this new test version of client to our  machines and than after we can try to perform the same CAN SSN  ( print or upload test )  and see  if   the test is passing or failing

 

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16122024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0041.zip

 

4)    Which client version of EPP   your Engineering Team using  and passing the test on your side ?

 

Please suggest to move forward .

 

NOTE :  Please reply to all to this email , so that my team is aware of the situation , kindly please , do not reply on the ticket other wise my teams will not get any response . 

 

Thanks

Hi Imran,

We will wait to hear back from you if the issue persists with the DPI settings mentioned by my colleague Eduard.

In case the issue still persists we will send the below examples you provided to our colleagues so they can further investigate the issue.

Hey Imran,

Engineering gave me an update. In their tests, everything worked as expected and Canada SIN numbers were found correctly, even after applying your contextual detection rules.
Could you please provide a test file with Canada SIN numbers to ensure the tested PIIs match our detection rules?
Also, can you do some additional tests with basic file uploads on dlptest.com for instance, with files containing Canada SIN, both with DPI on and off, and provide feedback on these tests?

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Imran,

As I mentioned in last week's meeting, I wanted to test it more before just presenting it to the engineering team. Me and my colleagues have done some testing in different ways trying to figure it out and when all returned the same outcome, I raised it to engineering.
I have the invite but I am unsure if I can join today. If I am unable, and you have some questions, please send them my way as usual.

Thank you,

Hey Imran,

Engineering just informed me that 375 814 356 was a mishap on their end and it should not trigger as an SIN number. The other 3 are still matching the checksum and are valid.
In light of this information, I would say it works as intended and the only way is to test with valid SIN numbers to see if they match the checksum and generate logs.
Let me know if that is possible.

Hey Imran,

That is what it triggers, and the file is set in a way to trigger it. Is the US SSN policy at a higher priority than the SIN one?

Hey Imran,

In the logs I see the policy 'Print US SSN Windows' trigger for the items in the file and matching context item 'soc sec', which are present in the file.
To me this works as intended. Are the logs missing from the console?

Hey Imran,

Yes, it is regarding Canada SIN. The SSN at the top is just a remnant most likely since it is still an SSN type, just that it is for Canada.
You can copy paste the examples, you do not need to use the exact file.

Eduard ,

The attached file Key word says  ""SSN""

If I print this than EPP will catch that as   US SSN   which is already working .

We are talking about CAN SIN

If I understand correctly ?

Hey Imran,

Please use the attached file to check the SIN detection. We have a checksum validation procedure that is following the Canadian format, unfortunately I cannot provide the exact validation steps, but it should work with real SIN numbers. We accept both formats ddd-ddd-ddd and ddd ddd ddd.
Please check the samples sent and let me know the outcome.

Hey Imran,

On The SIN number issue. Now that the server and agents are upgraded to the latest version, can you please test again with the file you sent over and gather some logs? Just on your machine should be more than enough.

Thank you,

Hi Imran,

Please find below the answers to the questions raised:

1. We would recommend upgrading the EPP server to the latest version 5941 and also using the most recent EPP client: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16122024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0041.zip
Note: Please create a Snapshot of the EPP server from the VM/AWS/Azure/GCP platform on which it is hosted, if it is hosted on your end.

2. Please test with the above mentioned client: 6.2.4.0041 as it is the most recent build. Please only use it for testing on a few test computers and do not mass deploy it. The 6.2.3.1 is a GA release client, improvements to the EPP clients are made almost daily by our devs so using the most recent test build may resolve the issue.

3. Please use the EPP client provided by my colleague Eduard for testing and let us know the outcome, after your colleagues managed to run their tests with it.

4. Our engineers and devs make new client builds almost daily with improvements and fixes. They usually test with the GA client(the one present on the EPP server) and also with the most recent test build. New functionalities or bug fixes are implemented in the new test builds and they will all be included in the next GA release client version.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

Hello EPP ,

In my current client version ( 6.2.2.2005 ) I am not able to generate the CAN SSN file print job triggered at EPP console ( see the attached file ) .   I also tried to upload the same file at DLPtest.com and did not get any alert on EPP console .

Now few things here ,

1 ) Today when I open the EPP server , I am seeing this server upgrade message ( see the 1st  picture below )   So my question is , do I need to update the server  ,   before I re attempt  to perform same testing on CAN SSN  ( print or upload test ) .

2)   When we go to ""System configuration > Client Software ""  I see the client version 6.2.3.1 , So my question is , do I need to update the client to 6.2.3.1  ,   before I re attempt  to perform same testing on CAN SSN  ( print or upload test ) .

3)  Edward sent us new build test client 3 days back and wanted to upgrade to only few users , We are still waiting from our  EUC team to install this new test version of client to our  machines and than after we can try to perform the same CAN SSN  ( print or upload test )  and see  if   the test is passing or failing

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp16122024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0041.zip

4)    Which client version of EPP   your Engineering Team using  and passing the test on your side ?

Please suggest to move forward .

NOTE :  Please reply to all to this email , so that my team is aware of the situation , kindly please , do not reply on the ticket other wise my teams will not get any response .

Thanks

Hi Imran,

We will wait to hear back from you if the issue persists with the DPI settings mentioned by my colleague Eduard.

In case the issue still persists we will send the below examples you provided to our colleagues so they can further investigate the issue.

Hey Imran,

Engineering gave me an update. In their tests, everything worked as expected and Canada SIN numbers were found correctly, even after applying your contextual detection rules.
Could you please provide a test file with Canada SIN numbers to ensure the tested PIIs match our detection rules?
Also, can you do some additional tests with basic file uploads on dlptest.com for instance, with files containing Canada SIN, both with DPI on and off, and provide feedback on these tests?

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Imran,

As I mentioned in last week's meeting, I wanted to test it more before just presenting it to the engineering team. Me and my colleagues have done some testing in different ways trying to figure it out and when all returned the same outcome, I raised it to engineering.
I have the invite but I am unsure if I can join today. If I am unable, and you have some questions, please send them my way as usual.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Imran,

As an update, since I did not manage to report or even block a single Canadian SIN number, this is not with engineering, and I am waiting for an update.
Will get back to you as soon as I have anything.

Thank you,
