Hi @Adrian Stanca 

Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce this issue as described and showed in the attached video.

I managed to reproduce some similar behavior by copying a file containing SQL code when no policy was applied. The file was uploaded to the cloud, as expected. Next, I enabled the policy with the same settings as presented in the video and recopied the same file (with the same name) to the synced location. This time, instead of being blocked, the file was uploaded. By copying a file (containing SQL code) with a different name or doing the steps presented in the video (copy-pasting SQL code to an empty file previously copied), it was blocked.

The only aspect that I would like to track now in order to get an idea on what happens is to see if the app somehow uses some cache locations, so that when a file that was previously allowed, would be also uploaded later (even when it should be blocked due to the SQL text copied to it) based on its name, and not on its hash.

In order to check if this is the case, please redo the test and try to change the name of the file in which you copy the SQL code before syncing to see if it still doesn't get blocked.

According to your result, I will prepare a test build with some additional logs.

Also, I might not be able to reproduce this if my Nextcloud version is different from the one that the customer uses. For testing, I used Nextcloud version 3.13.2. What version is the customer testing with?



Thank you!

Hi! @WaitingOnEngineer 

I have done some more tests trying to reproduce the case in different ways and also based on the latest observations, but with no success. 

I would suggest some additional tests with another exit point, such as uploading the test files in the browser to WeTransfer/Sendspace and see if in this way, the file is still uploaded.

On another note, from what I've seen in the logs, it seems that the synchronized location is a network share location. This might also have something to do with the issue. In order to check this, please try to redo the tests by synchronizing a local folder to the NextCloud, not a network share location and observe if the behavior is different in any way.


Another thing that would be helpful is the NextCloud version that the customer is using. I am currently using version 3.13.2 in the free mode. Maybe using some other version, or even the same one but with a paid subscription might affect the results.


Thank you!

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer

I have tried testing different scenarios by also syncing a Network Share location, but I was unsuccessful in reproducing the issue. The file was blocked every time, or if it was empty at first but then I added code to the file, it was blocked and deleted from the cloud, eventually. 

From the logs, there seems that the files are blocked, indeed, as stated in the video.  There is one time when the files are going through, but I suppose that is when they are empty. 

The customer confirmed before that if they change the name of the file, it gets blocked as expected. I am thinking now that this might also be related to the fact that the same content is copy-pasted to the file for several tests in a row. I suggest trying to do some slight changes to the uploaded code, and see if the issue still persists. Maybe something cache memory related is however happening, and because of the same content that is pasted, the file goes through. 

I would suggest redoing the tests by considering this aspect and by using a single file for clarity, as in the current logs, there are two files that are scanned (Test8.txt and Test9.txt). If the issue persists, another video of the test and some logs would come in helpful. 

Thank you!

I tried to reproduce this specifically for the case when a network share location is synced in NextCloud, but I was unsuccessful. The files are blocked as expected on my side both with a local and a network share location.
