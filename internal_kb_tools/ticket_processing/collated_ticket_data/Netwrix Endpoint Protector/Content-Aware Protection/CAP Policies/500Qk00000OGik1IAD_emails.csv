Thank you for reaching out to us.
You can block USB devices from the Device Control menu, and you have the possibility to block it globally(from Global Rights) or more granularly (Groups, Computer/Users, or devices). 
I will attach the user manual link below, where you can find more informations regarding how you can configure rights:
