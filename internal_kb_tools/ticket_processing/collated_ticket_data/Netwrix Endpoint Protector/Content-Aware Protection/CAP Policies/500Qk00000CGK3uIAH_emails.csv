Hello,

Usually the download is seen of network share and USB devices. Can I asume you are refering to them?
For this you can check the Source collumn. it should include 2 location with an arrow between >.
The location on the left is where it cam from.

Kind regards

Hello,

Okay, download here refers to the downloads from the browsers. I would not expect downloads to be captured, I am more interested with uploaded files but its little difficult to identify here.

Sample log is here:

[cid:image001.png@01DAC744.7885F740]

FYI: We do not have the DPI enabled yet.

Thanks

Hi Alin,

We are doing a POC for DPI but there is a conflict with Zscaler.

So, are you saying we cannot differentiate between downloaded and uploaded files without DPI enabled?

Thanks
Arpitha

Unfortunately you cannot differentiate between downloaded and uploaded files with DPI disabled. DPI has to be enabled from server UI and the DPI certificate needs to be added on the MacOS Keychain app and marked as Trusted, in order to help with this use case.

You can find more information on how to enable DPI correctly on MacOS here :
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/how-to-set-deep-packet-inspection-on-macos-big-sur
I recommend that you test on a couple of test machines first (preferably on your epp test environment).

""We are doing a POC for DPI but there is a conflict with Zscaler. ""
If there is a separate support ticket opened for this then please continue the investigation on the corresponding ticket. Otherwise I will ask you to please open a separate support ticket.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Arpitha,

You should have more information in the ""Destination Details"" field in CAP reports when having DPI enabled along with 'Reporting V2' option (which should be enabled by default in newer server versions).

Best Regards,
Alin

Hello,

 

Okay, download here refers to the downloads from the browsers. I would not expect downloads to be captured, I am more interested with uploaded files but its little difficult to identify here. 

 

Sample log is here:

 



 

FYI: We do not have the DPI enabled yet. 

 

Thanks

Arpitha

Hello,

Usually the download is seen of network share and USB devices. Can I asume you are refering to them?
For this you can check the Source collumn. it should include 2 location with an arrow between >.
The location on the left is where it cam from.

Kind regards

________________________________
Hi Arpitha,

Unfortunately you cannot differentiate between downloaded and uploaded files with DPI disabled. DPI has to be enabled from server UI and the DPI certificate needs to be added on the MacOS Keychain app and marked as Trusted, in order to help with this use case.

You can find more information on how to enable DPI correctly on MacOS here :
https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/how-to-set-deep-packet-inspection-on-macos-big-sur<https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/endpoint-protector/how-to-set-deep-packet-inspection-on-macos-big-sur>
I recommend that you test on a couple of test machines first (preferably on your epp test environment).

""We are doing a POC for DPI but there is a conflict with Zscaler. ""
If there is a separate support ticket opened for this then please continue the investigation on the corresponding ticket. Otherwise I will ask you to please open a separate support ticket.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Alin,

I have another case open with Netwrix to work on the DPI. DPI did not help us with the latest agent.

I wouldn’t agree they are false positives. I see the alerts only when I download the files.

Thanks
Arpitha

Hi Arpitha,

There is a possibility those are false positives.
I recommend that you test this scenario on a single machine with DPI enabled and ideally with the latest agent version.
Let us know the results.

Thank you,
Alin

Hi Alin,

We are doing a POC for DPI but there is a conflict with Zscaler.

So, are you saying we cannot differentiate between downloaded and uploaded files without DPI enabled?

Thanks
Arpitha
