Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

HI Ovidiu,



Hope you are well.



I need your assistance to address this request; at present 95% users are on Zoho mails and EPP doesnt support it....I am highly non-compliant to DLP norms, unable to reason the DLP investment.


Need your experts to enable support for Zoho mails and Zoho cliq app for DLP rules enforcement. Any assistance needed from my end or Zoho side, I will facilitate but lets see how quick this can be done.

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,
 
 As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
 For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
 For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.
 
 Kind regards

Hello,


 


I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.


 


So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,
 
 If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
 Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,
 
 For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,


 


But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments send outside my organization over email.


 


Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,
 
 Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
 In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.
 
 For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.
 
 Kind regards

Hi Swapnil,

Thanks for reaching out. Hope you’re doing well.

I’m adding @Oana<mailto:Oana.Nemes@netwrix.com> in the loop whom you’ll already know.  She’s on Holiday but she’ll be back next week.
Meanwhile, @techsupport<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>, please have a look at the inquiry below ? The DPI is enabled so we should be able to monitor the webmail / browser ?

As for Zoho app support, Swapnil, this is not currently supported in the policy exit points.
@techsupport<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com> – Should Swapnil & team open a feature request here?

Thanks !
Ovidiu

HI Ovidiu,

Hope you are well.

I need your assistance to address this request; at present 95% users are on Zoho mails and EPP doesnt support it....I am highly non-compliant to DLP norms, unable to reason the DLP investment.

Need your experts to enable support for Zoho mails and Zoho cliq app for DLP rules enforcement. Any assistance needed from my end or Zoho side, I will facilitate but lets see how quick this can be done.


Regards


Swapnil Patil

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):
We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Swapnil,

 

Thanks for reaching out. Hope you’re doing well.

 

I’m adding  @Oana in the loop whom you’ll already know.  She’s on Holiday but she’ll be back next week.

Meanwhile,  @techsupport, please have a look at the inquiry below ? The DPI is enabled so we should be able to monitor the webmail / browser ? 

 

As for Zoho app support, Swapnil, this is not currently supported in the policy exit points. 

@techsupport – Should Swapnil & team open a feature request here? 

 

Thanks !

Ovidiu

HI Ovidiu,



 



Hope you are well.



 



I need your assistance to address this request; at present 95% users are on Zoho mails and EPP doesnt support it....I am highly non-compliant to DLP norms, unable to reason the DLP investment.



 



Need your experts to enable support for Zoho mails and Zoho cliq app for DLP rules enforcement. Any assistance needed from my end or Zoho side, I will facilitate but lets see how quick this can be done.



 



Regards

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,



 



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



 



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



 



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments send outside my organization over email.



 



Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Botond,

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Jitendra - please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.
@Botond - the DPI is already set to ON - this needs troubleshooting.

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

 

 


Thanks & Regards,


 Jitendra Gupta

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January): 

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 








Thanks & Regards,

Hello Andrei,



 



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.



 



 



Thanks & Regards,

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



 



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



 



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.


Thanks & Regards,
 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra - please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.
@Botond - the DPI is already set to ON - this needs troubleshooting.

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

 

 


Thanks & Regards,


 Jitendra Gupta

++ Everyone

 

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

 

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January): 

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 








Thanks & Regards,

Hello Andrei,



 



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



 



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Kind regards

Hello,



 



But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments send outside my organization over email.



 



Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Kind regards

Hello Jitendra,

Great meeting you!
To make sure that we are effective in addressing the concerns raised, let's divide these concerns based on thgeir particularities:

1) We'll keep current ticket #432842 to address the file uploaded to browsers and the recommendations that our colleagues made for monitoring the files transferred through Outlook that are outside of the scope of point 2) listed below

2) For Outlook, our documentation lists this as a known limitation that will be addressed in future releases. Please check below link (last item on the list at page 41):
https://community.netwrix.com/c/endpoint-protector/announcements/106

3) Support for webmail and e-mail client applications
 - In case of email client applications, we currently support the applications that are listed inside Content Aware Policies > Policy Exit Points > Applications > Email.
- In case of web-based email applications, our documentation states the following:
Monitor webmail – Enable this setting to scan the subject and body for Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo on the browser. Attachments will be monitored regardless of this setting. (https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/ContentAwareProtection/DeepPacket.htm)

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.


I hope that the above details will help the audience copied here to understand the particularities of the described case and also help moving forward towards resolving the issues related to uploads into web browsers.

Hi Botond,



We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.



Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.





Thanks & Regards,

 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,



The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.



Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.



This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Kind regards

Hi Jitendra,
 
 We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.
 
 Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user
 base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,


 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

 

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,
 
 The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.
 
 For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.
 
 For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):
We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
 For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
 For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web
 and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Hello Andrei,


 


If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because
 majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,
 
 As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
 For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
 For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.
 
 Kind regards

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho
 because major users are available in outlook and zoho.


 


So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,
 
 If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
 Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,
 
 For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,


 


But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments
 send outside my organization over email.


 


Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me
 know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,
 
 Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
 In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.
 
 For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.


Thanks & Regards,
 Jitendra Gupta

++ Everyone

@Jitendra - please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.
@Botond - the DPI is already set to ON - this needs troubleshooting.

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

 

 


Thanks & Regards,


 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

 

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 








Thanks & Regards,

Hello Andrei,



 



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.



 



 



Thanks & Regards,

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



 



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



 



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,



We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.



Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.





Thanks & Regards,

 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,



The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.



Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.



This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,



But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments send outside my organization over email.



Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Oana,


We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details 


Exit point - Zoho mail app
Email client app as well as browser based email client 
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC




Exit point - Zoho Cliq app
Chat client app as well as browser based chat client 
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC


Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.
In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,



Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?



I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:



For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand
 that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.



Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:

      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;

      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.



The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.




We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.



Looking forward to hearing from you,








Oana Nemes

Hi Jitendra,



We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users
 on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,



The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.



For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.



For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.

For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.

For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most
 of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,



As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will
 not be monitored.

For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.

For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.



Kind regards

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.




 




So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,



Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.

In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.



For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.



Kind regards

Hi Oana,

 

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details 

 

Exit point - Zoho mail app

Email client app as well as browser based email client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

 

Exit point - Zoho Cliq app

Chat client app as well as browser based chat client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.

In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

 

Regards

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

 Jitendra Gupta

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

 

Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

 

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

 

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

 

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

But if I add in DPI allow list then I don't have any control over attachments send outside my organization over email.

 

Parallelly I am setting up OLD Outlook on test user. Till then let me know what the workaround for will be the same.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Kind regards

Hello Swapnil,

Thank you for getting back to me for these details.
Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital? This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.

Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)?

LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.
Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.

Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.

Best regards,
Oana

Hi Swapnil,

Small clarification, are the attachments getting blocked/reported on the Zoho browser applications?

Hi Oana,

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details

Exit point - Zoho mail app
Email client app as well as browser based email client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC


Exit point - Zoho Cliq app
Chat client app as well as browser based chat client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.
In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Oana Nemes

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,



We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.



Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,



The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.



Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.



This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Oana,


I have 4500 endpoints and 7000 odd mobile devices.


Browser restrictions works but that hinders ability of data sharing with peers..i.e. within organisation. DLP shall come into force only if email includes users outside Capri domain.


For data security, we may not be able to wait for months. If Zoho mail app not supported in EPP, I have to work on alternative outside EPP.

Hello Swapnil,



Thank you for getting back to me for these details.

Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital?
 This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.



Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching
 files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)? 



LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to
 be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.

Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team
 posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.



Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.



Best regards,


Oana

Hi Oana,

 

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.



Below are the details 

 

Exit point - Zoho mail app

Email client app as well as browser based email client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

 

Exit point - Zoho Cliq app

Chat client app as well as browser based chat client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60%
 data gets shared through email only.

In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,



Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?



I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:



For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand
 that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.



Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:

      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;

      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.



The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.




We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.



Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Jitendra,



We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Jitendra,



We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.



Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of
 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,



The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.



For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.



For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor
 the files going through Outlook.

For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.

For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms,
 as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

Hello Andrei,

 

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,



As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.

For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.

For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.



Kind regards

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,



Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.

In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.



For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Hi Swapnil,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Zoho email services. We understand how important it is for your business for the DLP solution to offer complex features for your preferred email platform.
To better assess your needs, could you confirm if Zoho Mail is a recent addition to your workflow/ technology stack? The present request is the first one we have received for this specific email application.  These details will help our team understand how critical this integration is for your operations.
Currently our development efforts are focused on supporting the most widely used email platforms, such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail that hold together approx. 80% of the market share, as they also serve the majority of our user base. While we continually assess new exit points to be added on the list of supported applications we have to prioritize features that align with broader customer demand. At this time, we cannot commit to adding support for Zoho Mail in the very near future, but we appreciate your input as we evaluate our roadmap.

We value your business and are happy to discuss any potential workarounds that might help in the meantime.

Best regards,
Oana

Hi Oana,

I have 4500 endpoints and 7000 odd mobile devices.

Browser restrictions works but that hinders ability of data sharing with peers..i.e. within organisation. DLP shall come into force only if email includes users outside Capri domain.

For data security, we may not be able to wait for months. If Zoho mail app not supported in EPP, I have to work on alternative outside EPP.

Hello Swapnil,

Thank you for getting back to me for these details.
Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital? This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.

Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)?

LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.
Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.

Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.

Best regards,
Oana

Hi Oana,

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details

Exit point - Zoho mail app
Email client app as well as browser based email client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC


Exit point - Zoho Cliq app
Chat client app as well as browser based chat client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.
In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Oana Nemes

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

We can schedule a remote session for the next week so we can look into the Outlook issue.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,



We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.



Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

++ Everyone



@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.



Thanks !

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,



The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.



Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.



This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Both microsoft n Google are expensive...there is shift in approach and Zoho offers competative advantage. We onboard Zoho platform a quarter back and completed 7k mailbox migration without major issue.

I again request you to priorities Zoho exit point support to keep EPP as relevant technology for my organisations DLP requirements.

Hi Swapnil,



Thank you for your feedback regarding Zoho email services. We understand how important it is for your business for the DLP solution to offer complex features for your preferred email platform.

To better assess your needs, could you confirm if Zoho Mail is a recent addition to your workflow/ technology stack? The present request is the first one we have received for this specific email application.  These details will help our team understand how
 critical this integration is for your operations.

Currently our development efforts are focused on supporting the most widely used email platforms, such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail that hold together approx. 80% of the market share, as they also serve the majority of our user base. While we continually
 assess new exit points to be added on the list of supported applications we have to prioritize features that align with broader customer demand. At this time, we cannot commit to adding support for Zoho Mail in the very near future, but we appreciate your
 input as we evaluate our roadmap.



We value your business and are happy to discuss any potential workarounds that might help in the meantime. 



Best regards,


Oana

Hi Oana,





I have 4500 endpoints and 7000 odd mobile devices.





Browser restrictions works but that hinders ability of data sharing with peers..i.e. within organisation. DLP shall come into force only if email includes users outside Capri domain.





For data security, we may not be able to wait for months. If Zoho mail app not supported in EPP, I have to work on alternative outside EPP.

Hello Swapnil,



Thank you for getting back to me for these details.

Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital?
 This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.



Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching
 files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)? 



LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to
 be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.

Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team
 posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.



Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.



Best regards,


Oana

Hi Oana,

 

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.



Below are the details 

 

Exit point - Zoho mail app

Email client app as well as browser based email client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

 

Exit point - Zoho Cliq app

Chat client app as well as browser based chat client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60%
 data gets shared through email only.

In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,



Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?



I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:



For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand
 that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.



Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:

      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;

      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.



The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.




We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.



Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Jitendra,



We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000,
 with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

Hi Ovidiu,



The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.



For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.



For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files
 going through Outlook.

For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.

For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most
 of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

 

 


Thanks & Regards,

Hello,



As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.

For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.

For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.



Kind regards

Hello,

 

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

 

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

 

 


Thanks & Regards,

Hello,



If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.

Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,



For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,



Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.

In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.



For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.



Kind regards

Both microsoft n Google are expensive...there is shift in approach and Zoho offers competative advantage. We onboard Zoho platform a quarter back and completed 7k mailbox migration without major issue.

I again request you to priorities Zoho exit point support to keep EPP as relevant technology for my organisations DLP requirements.

Hi Swapnil,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Zoho email services. We understand how important it is for your business for the DLP solution to offer complex features for your preferred email platform.
To better assess your needs, could you confirm if Zoho Mail is a recent addition to your workflow/ technology stack? The present request is the first one we have received for this specific email application.  These details will help our team understand how critical this integration is for your operations.
Currently our development efforts are focused on supporting the most widely used email platforms, such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail that hold together approx. 80% of the market share, as they also serve the majority of our user base. While we continually assess new exit points to be added on the list of supported applications we have to prioritize features that align with broader customer demand. At this time, we cannot commit to adding support for Zoho Mail in the very near future, but we appreciate your input as we evaluate our roadmap.

We value your business and are happy to discuss any potential workarounds that might help in the meantime.

Best regards,
Oana

Hi Oana,

I have 4500 endpoints and 7000 odd mobile devices.

Browser restrictions works but that hinders ability of data sharing with peers..i.e. within organisation. DLP shall come into force only if email includes users outside Capri domain.

For data security, we may not be able to wait for months. If Zoho mail app not supported in EPP, I have to work on alternative outside EPP.

Hello Swapnil,

Thank you for getting back to me for these details.
Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital? This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.

Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)?

LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.
Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.

Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.

Best regards,
Oana

Hi Oana,

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details

Exit point - Zoho mail app
Email client app as well as browser based email client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC


Exit point - Zoho Cliq app
Chat client app as well as browser based chat client
OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.
In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Regarding Zoho, as it's not an exit point, we will have to raise a feature request, could you please open a different ticket so we can do that?

Hi Botond,



We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.



Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Jitendra – please sync with Botond here for a remote session to check.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,



The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.



Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.



This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,



If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,



I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.



So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Hello,

For the old outlook you will need to remove the DPI option from the app and ensure the Epp addon is enabled on outlook.

Hello,

Regarding the email allowlist for web email. The attachment will not be able to be allowed based on the email allowlist.
In this case the only option would be to include outlook.office.com in the DPI allowlist.

For new outlook, there is an addon in the works. It will take time for it to be available.

Both microsoft n Google are expensive...there is shift in approach and Zoho offers competative advantage. We onboard Zoho platform a quarter back and completed 7k mailbox migration without major issue.

I again request you to priorities Zoho exit point support to keep EPP as relevant technology for my organisations DLP requirements.

Hi Swapnil,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Zoho email services. We understand how important it is for your business for the DLP solution to offer complex features for your preferred email platform.
To better assess your needs, could you confirm if Zoho Mail is a recent addition to your workflow/ technology stack? The present request is the first one we have received for this specific email application.  These details will help our team understand how critical this integration is for your operations.
Currently our development efforts are focused on supporting the most widely used email platforms, such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail that hold together approx. 80% of the market share, as they also serve the majority of our user base. While we continually assess new exit points to be added on the list of supported applications we have to prioritize features that align with broader customer demand. At this time, we cannot commit to adding support for Zoho Mail in the very near future, but we appreciate your input as we evaluate our roadmap.

We value your business and are happy to discuss any potential workarounds that might help in the meantime. 

Best regards,

Oana

Hi Oana,

 

I have 4500 endpoints and 7000 odd mobile devices.

 

Browser restrictions works but that hinders ability of data sharing with peers..i.e. within organisation. DLP shall come into force only if email includes users outside Capri domain.

 

For data security, we may not be able to wait for months. If Zoho mail app not supported in EPP, I have to work on alternative outside EPP.

Hello Swapnil,

Thank you for getting back to me for these details.
Checking our system, I noticed that according to our records Capri Global Capital is currently licensing 4500 Windows, macOS and Linux computers, are the remaining 5500 computers licensed under a diffrent company name that is different from Capri Global Capital? This clarification would be helpful to make sure our system reflects reality.

Concerning the attachments to Zoho web email application (file uploaded into web browser), as my colleague from support team advised: can you please confirm that the policies that you have in place for web browsers are alos applying when users are attaching files to Zoho web email application (Endpoint Protector should treat such actions as uploads to web browsers)? 

LDS Infotech team already created a support ticket on behalf of Capri Global Capital (#00440314 - Feature Request for Zoho Application and Zoho Webmail) and our support team already registered it in our internal system. This request is currently awaiting to be reviewed by our Product Management team that will analyze it against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future release, or it may get rejected.
Based on my experience, the review may take a few months, and if a decision is taken to implement the feature, implementation would also take several months, and many aspects may influence the development and testing phases. We'll be happy to keep your team posted on the progress here, reaching out to you as soon as a decision is made by the Product Management team.

Please let us know if we can help with other details. We'll be also waiting to hear back from you on the above questions concerning attachments to Zoho web email application.

Best regards,

Oana

Hi Oana,

 

We have 10k users using Zoho mails and Zoho Cliq  app as email and chat platform.

Below are the details 

 

Exit point - Zoho mail app

Email client app as well as browser based email client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

 

Exit point - Zoho Cliq app

Chat client app as well as browser based chat client 

OS - Windows , Linux, MAC

 

Could you please raise feature request for us and share request details to track progress? I also like to know general ETA for customer initiated feature requests...this is very critical for us to monitor Zoho as exit point as 50-60% data gets shared through email only.

In absence of this feature, EPP may not able to provide desire outcome for DLP protection. Kindly assist us here

Hello Jitendra,

Can you please help us understand what is the expected outcome of the call that was proposed?

I would like to list below a few details that I included in my email from Friday, March 28th:

For channels/ exit points that are not currently supported, we advise customers to raise dedicated support tickets providing as many details as possible about the unsupported exist point (official source, operating systems it runns on, etc.)  - I understand that your team already created a ticked for Zoho Suite.

Just to set the right expectations, I would like to describe the process we follow for the feature requests that customers register with us:
      (1) support team registers the feature request in our system and closes the support ticket as it is transfered internally to the right stakeholders;
      (2) these requests are reviewed by the Product Management team that analyze them against the product strategy and the current roadmap; this analysis may conclude with the decision to implement the feature in a future realese or it may get rejected.

The process described above may take several months to complete, but we'll be happy to keep our customers posted on the progress.

We'll be happy to help with any other clarifications you may need.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

 

Oana Nemes

Hi Jitendra,

We can schedule the call, but the Zoho Suite is still not an exit point, therefore we can't monitor what passes through it.

Hi Botond,

 

We have already enabled the DPI option and blocked files at the browser level, as previously explained to Andrei. The customer has a user base of 11,000, with 10,000 users on Zoho. Please suggest how we can proceed with restricting file transfers over the Zoho Suite.

 

Additionally, the new Outlook and Outlook webmail are unable to scan attachments.

@Botond – the DPI is already set to ON – this needs troubleshooting.

Hi Ovidiu,

The ticket was closed on February 21st because the customer hasn't replied since January 29th, and we were required to close tickets with no response as per Netwrix policy.

For Zoho, a feature request is needed as you suggested.

For New Outlook and Outlook web,  Andrei suggested to try the following (back in January):

We understand the need for a solution regarding New Outlook. We are currently working on it. As a workaround, you can set a CAP policy to monitor the files going through Outlook.
For this to work please make sure the server is at version 5.9.4.1 and the Epp client version is at 6.2.4.2.
For webmail you can try to turn on the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level:

Hi Ovidiu,

 

The customer has requested urgent remediation and solutions to block sensitive data in Outlook and Zoho, both on web and application platforms, as most of their data is transmitted via email.

 

Please schedule a Zoom meeting at your earliest convenience to address these concerns.

 

This matter is of high priority due to escalating customer issues.

Hello Andrei,

 

If new outlook has limitations, so customers wants solution for it because majority of data is flowing through email only.

Hello,

As mentioned for the new Outlook there is a limitation that at most the new Outlook can be reported, for the Zoho app if it is not available in the policy exit points it will not be monitored.
For webmail you can try to turn od the DPI option, resulting in the file being blocked on the browser level.
For Zimbra, can you confirm if the file is blocked or not? Also you can try other apps or websites to confirm if the file is blocked there.

Kind regards

Hello,

 

I can check with Zimbra but my main concern is with Outlook and Zoho because major users are available in outlook and zoho.

 

So kindly provide me solution for this ASAP.

Hello,

If Zoho is not available on the CAP policy exitpoints the Zoho app will not be monitored.
Did you get the chance to check Zimbra ?

Kind regards

Hello,

 

Ok I understand the limitations for new outlook but customer wants to remediation on priority basis also they wants solutions to block sensitive data over outlook web for attachments also on other webmail solution like (Zoho and Zimbra).

 

Kindly do this on urgent basis because customers is escalating this issues.
