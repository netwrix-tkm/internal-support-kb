Hello André 

 

Ah yes I see, the email used for that initial communication was not correct. 

Tomorrow is great for me, can we do 11:30am CET?

 

Kind regards, 

Anya

Dear Anya,

Thankyou for following up on this case.  I sent an email on the 11th November to request for a remote session but we have not received a response (see below email).  Can we schedule a remote session for tomorrow? if yes please let me know which hours you would be available.



Kind regards
