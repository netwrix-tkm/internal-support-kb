"500Qk00000NwQT7IAN","00441702","Support Ticket","I am going to push Server Update in morning, want to review CAP","Hi, after discussing earlier today, I was able to get a snapshot of our server and are ready to update to 5.9.4.1, i will be doing it in morning. i would like to have a call again to discuss the CAP policies after the update. it was mentioned the update could fix some things that were not going right such as our Contextual Detection and a few other things such as EPPNotifier does not turn off on a specific policy and I am getting told my users I have been testing on that they are annoyred with it. Is there possibility to have a zoom any time in between 11am PT-1:30 PT, or 2:45pm PT to 5pm PT.","","","","As we spoke we upgraded the EPP client on your end and made some adjustments. We also enabled Silent mode so pop-ups no longer appear.

We strongly recommend upgrading the EPP clients for the other users as well and then setting the EPP client Mode to Silent mode and see if they still experience the issues with the notifications.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","0.5","Closed - Resolved","DataVisor","Ismail Reyhanoglu","2025-04-11T07:15:19.000Z","2025-04-11T19:03:36.000Z"
