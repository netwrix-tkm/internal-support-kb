"500Qk00000MZr4rIAD","00437757","Support Ticket","Unable to Block Facebook and Instagram","All websites are blocked except Facebook and Instagram, which are mentioned in the deny list.","","Connected remote for the 3rd time and we managed to re-install the EPP but this time we allowed the eppclient to have full access to the disk, accessibility and bluetooth.
Also we disabled/enabled back the intercept VPN from the computer settings, and updated the policy on the MAC and now the network extension was enabled accordingly.
We tried multiple portals and all of them were properly blocked.","Will have to set up another remote session.","We've connected remote to the client's computer to assist further.
Checked the CAP policy along with the denylist for the web/domains that he wanted to block.
First, we noticed he didn't mentioned the domains right and we simply changed them to *facebook.com and instagram.com.
Also, locally on the machine he did not had the network extension enabled.
Went to the DPI, enabled intercept VPN traffic and then enabled the network extension for the machine and tested again.
Client was able to block the sites accordingly along with other domains such as gmail, yahoo, wetransfer etc.","","Marian Ilies","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","2.1","Closed - Resolved","Mordor Intelligence Pvt.
