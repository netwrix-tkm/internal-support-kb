Hi Andrei, the 17th April logs have no epp-client and sslsplit logs, and reprovision.db contains no active policy. But based on the other logs, the problem is that ""*clients6.google.com*"" is added to the domain whitelist, and Google Drive uploads go there. ""*clients2.google.com*"" is also whitelisted, if there will be further issues they can try to remove that too.
