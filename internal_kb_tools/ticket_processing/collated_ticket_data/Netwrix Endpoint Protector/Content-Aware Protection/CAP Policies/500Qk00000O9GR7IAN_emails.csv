Hi Marian,

We have added emails in the same way but it does not block the personal email IDs.

What I meant by the certificate is that Netwrix provides a certificate for the website which is being monitored by Netwrix I believe, so the same is not available in the certificate page of the browser.

Thanks for getting back to me on this one.

On one of the test devices, could you make sure the DPI is enabled accordingly in computer settings:


Also in regards of the certificate, that should be added automatically if you are working with a Windows device.

Could you take a look again, close the browser, update the policy and try again?

Looking forward to your response.
