We have two concerns mentioned below - 
1) How we can add the new username and hostname to the block policy (by default once the user is onboarded on the portal)
2) How to identity the devices and username if they are added to the policies or not)

Please connect with ASAP, to discuss about these issue/ quires.

Regards,
