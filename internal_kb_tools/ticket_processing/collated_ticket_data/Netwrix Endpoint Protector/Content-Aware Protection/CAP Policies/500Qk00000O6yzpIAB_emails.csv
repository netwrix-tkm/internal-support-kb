Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have checked how the logs are generated and by who. 
If the user is connected to a machine where the EPP client have the username administrator, then that username will be displayed in the logs.

For example when Emin connected RDP to the machine and check the eppclient the machine had the username: administrator not Emin.

When he renamed the file from his computer, his username: emin was displayed.

Each machine that have EPP client installed have a specific username assigned.
Since the issue has been solved we will close the case.

Best regards,
