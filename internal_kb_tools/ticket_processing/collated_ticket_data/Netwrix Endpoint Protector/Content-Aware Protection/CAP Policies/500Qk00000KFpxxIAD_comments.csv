@WaitingOnEngineer 

We have investigated the issue, the logs show that two policies are loaded: ""Windows Report"" and ""Network"". The OCR code path might take some time (based on transferred image) and so, until the OCR is finished, the transfer is by default blocked, if any policy is a block policy (because we cannot assume anything about the transferred image, it might contain confidential information).
In this ticket, it appears that the OCR indeed takes time and we need to investigate/understand why that happens.

As a workaround: the image should be saved to disk and even if it would be blocked on the first attempt, subsequent attempts should not block it as the OCR'ed text should be available.

We have prepared a test build, version 6.2.4.0054.
@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan , could you please create an external customer link for the following build? https://artprodsu6weu.artifacts.visualstudio.com/A0de2cc68-d632-492d-80cc-1a45e7272652/a0cb5e0d-d22a-47f8-8152-dffe74ca50bf/_apis/artifact/cGlwZWxpbmVhcnRpZmFjdDovL05ldHdyaXhDb3Jwb3JhdGlvbi9wcm9qZWN0SWQvYTBjYjVlMGQtZDIyYS00N2Y4LTgxNTItZGZmZTc0Y2E1MGJmL2J1aWxkSWQvMzM0ODgxL2FydGlmYWN0TmFtZS9lcHAtY2xpZW50LXdpbmRvd3MteDg2LXg2NC1tc2k1/content?format=file&subPath=%2fEPPClientSetup.6.2.4.0054_x86_64.msi

DULY NOTE: this is a just a test build, please install it only on a few machines (Windows 10 or later).
Please try to replicate the problem with this test build.

Hi Andre,

I hope you are well.

Currently, we do not have a committed release date for the release where this fix will be included in.

What I can tell you now is that after the EL release (5.9.4.2) is released, this fix will go in the next one.

Regards,
Cristi
