@WaitingOnEngineer


Can you please made a short video to see exactly what is happening?
I tried with the latest sources and worked as expected (the file was blocked when a file was transfered from PC to phone).

The customer created a video.
It shows that even when AirDrop is blocked, files can still be exchanged between devices. Additionally, the logs only capture transfers from the phone to the MacBook.

@WaitingOnEngineer
The data breach scenario is related to transfer data from PC -> PHONE, NOT transfering data from PHONE -> PC. From the received video the data was transfered from phone to pc.

The same behaviour is with browsers (the downloaded DATA is NOT blocked by the epp agent), only the uploaded data is blocked.

What the customer wants?
If the customer wants to block the data from phone to pc (this is a feature request) and I don't know if will be approved because it is NOT considered a data leak.

I observerd the file was reported in epp logs (it was scanned because was accessed by one monitor process). -> This is a false positive.

The customer wants to NOT report the false positive?

@WaitingOnEngineer
A bug was detected when the files are Drag and Drop into Airdrop app. (if the same file is sent via Airdrop using right click -> share, the file will be blocked).

A ticket was created and the PM will establish when we can deliver the fix. @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Krzysztof Staszalek

If the internal ticket will be solved, we can deliver a TEST build if the customer wants.

This is a really important information which was NOT mentioned in ticket when was created. (after few messages and video we managed to understood the entire situation).

This ticket from dev perspective can be closed, as I mentioned the PM will decide the target version of the fix. @Krzysztof Staszalek
