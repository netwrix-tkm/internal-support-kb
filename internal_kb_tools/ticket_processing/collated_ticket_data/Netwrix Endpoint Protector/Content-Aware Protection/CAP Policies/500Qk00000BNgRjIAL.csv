Can you help me asap. I have this topic open since Wednesday last week. Natalie couldn’t help me further.

The customer Linear still has some open topics during the POC.
I translated below my exchange with the customer about the different topics and put it together, so you better follow the conversation:

1. Linear: We have restricted the clipboard so that only paste is blocked. However, the information appears during copying that the content has been blocked, even though this is not the case. Is this a bug?
CoSoSys: No, this is not a bug but expected behaviour. The blocking occurs during the copy action. Could you please let us know how you configured the clipboard to only block pasting? Please send us a screenshot.
Linear: Attached is an image of our clipboard configuration. With this setup, you can use the copy command, but pasting is restricted. During copying, it says it is blocked, but it is not actually blocked.
Question: is there anything that they should configure differently?
2. Linear: We created an empty text file and placed it in the Nextcloud synchronization folder. Then we started the synchronization. After it finished, we opened this file in Visual Studio and copied code into it. During the next Nextcloud synchronization, the file is simply synchronized. However, if we write the code directly before the first synchronization, it is immediately blocked.
CoSoSys: It is expected behaviour: the scanning (and reporting/blocking) of a file occurs when it accesses a controlled application (in this case, Nextcloud).
Linear: That doesn’t seem to be working for us. The first time it is controlled. But when Nextcloud accesses it a second time to synchronize, it is no longer controlled.

Question: They seem to expect the files to be controlled every time they synchronized Nextcloud. As far I understand, if the file hasn’t been moved but only the content of the file has been modified, there is no scan of it. Is it the correct expected behaviour?

Thanks for your help!
