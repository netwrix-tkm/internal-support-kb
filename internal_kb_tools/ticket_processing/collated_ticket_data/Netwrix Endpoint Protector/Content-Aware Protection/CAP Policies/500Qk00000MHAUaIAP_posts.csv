2025.03.11 Update:
Regarding the column ""Destination Details"" not being shown, the SSH protocols are encrypted and this the reason it is not feasible to conduct an inspection of encrypted exit points like powershell, rsync, sftp, AWS CLI, scp (mobaxterm).

Regarding the column ""Destination"", Endpoint Protector only reports on the protocol (like SSH or FTP) being used to transfer the files and not the application name.  Existing customers have the option to raise feature requests and improvement requests to Endpoint Protector, to have the application name shown instead of the protocol an improvement request can be made.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-11T14:59:32.000Z"

Customer agreed that case can be closed but asked for a feature request to have the application name shown under ""Details"" column of Content Aware Report instead of the protocol name.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-17T14:03:15.000Z"
