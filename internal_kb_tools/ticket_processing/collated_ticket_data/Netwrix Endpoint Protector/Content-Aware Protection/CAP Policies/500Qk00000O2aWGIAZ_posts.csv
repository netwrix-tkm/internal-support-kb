Our main goal was to stop the eppnotifier popups from spamming, and the update fixed that on my device. I tried it on a user's device right now and denylist works right, and eppnotifier does not show too, which is how we want it.

However, I tried it on a testdevice here, and it does not apply right. For example, one website allows, and another wesbite blocks, when both of them should be blocked. The Eppnotifier also spams for this device too. i removed client and re-installed it and same issues on this device. it is on the same policy as the other 2 devices that are working correctly. How can I fix this? We are trying to apply to whole company very soon so have to make sure deployment is working fully right. I am free today till 5pm PT","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-14T17:49:07.000Z"
