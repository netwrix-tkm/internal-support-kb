I have two questions around logging. 

1. We are currently monitoring DLP events via printers and the logging of blocked events appears in the Content Aware Report. However, the InfoSec team is interested in seeing all printing logs whether they are blocked or successful. That way they can see the files being printed. Is that possible? 

2. For files that are blocked, is there a way to retain a copy of the file that was attempted so the security team can scan then? 

Thank you!","","the customer had two questions which I answered.","waiting for ticket closure confirmation","Qs were answered","","Eduard Nut","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Segal Benz","Anoush d'Orville","2025-03-10T15:55:29.000Z","2025-03-11T21:39:44.000Z"
