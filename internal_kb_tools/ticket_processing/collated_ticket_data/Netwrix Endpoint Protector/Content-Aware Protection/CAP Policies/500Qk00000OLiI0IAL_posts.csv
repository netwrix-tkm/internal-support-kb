I created a policy to block sensitive data—like Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB, email addresses, and Malaysian IDs—from being sent via apps. It successfully blocks file transfers on WhatsApp, but when using Outlook Desktop with the same file attached (PDF or Word), the transfer goes through without being blocked, and no incident is logged. Outlook is selected as an exit point and the policy action is set to ""Block."" Why is this happening? Is there something I’m missing in the configuration?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-23T03:24:44.000Z"
