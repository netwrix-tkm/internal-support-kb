A user has reported an issue where he receives regular pop up notification saying content has been blocked when he is not attempting to upload any content - just brose the web site.

The alert claims to have blocked a number of credit card number.  Not always the same number, but sometimes they are the same.

In the content aware report we see these reported as web-upload (no file name) and the events are not logged against any particular website, just Mozilla.

I'll send a screenshot so you can see.

How can we determine the cause of these please and will it be possible to exception if there is no web site shown in the report?

Thank you,
Dave","","-connected with the customer and found that the server is on 5.9.4.0
- the disk space was pretty full
- cleared the disk space
- asked the customer to upgrade to 5.9.4.1 to check if the issue still persists
- client: 6.2.4.2

19.03
- issue is happening on *sendgrid.com - application for sending bulk email
- blocks are false since nothing is being uploaded
- it happens randomly when going from one page to another
- there is a CAP policy to monitor credit cards
- created contextual detection rule for this policy","waiting on the customer to further test","contextual detection for credit cards fixed the issue","","Botond Biro","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","45.7","Closed - Resolved","Aptitude Software","Dave Young","2025-02-09T20:46:15.000Z","2025-03-27T12:58:20.000Z"
