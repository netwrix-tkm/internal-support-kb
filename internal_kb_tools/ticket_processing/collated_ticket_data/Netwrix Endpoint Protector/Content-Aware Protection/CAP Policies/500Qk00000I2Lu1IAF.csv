(I’m using macOS 15 Sequoia)

I’m trying to block the sharing of files like PNGs and PDFs via AirDrop. However, while the content inspection report shows that the transfer was blocked, the files are still being exchanged successfully in practice.

I’m unsure how to capture this issue in screenshots, but currently, files can still be shared between my MacBook and iPhone, despite the web console indicating that the transfer was blocked.

Could you assist with this issue? Thank you.","","","","Fix for the issue registered in XLS in 5.9.6.0 backlog","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","83.0","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Korea","daehee kim","2024-11-08T05:10:58.000Z","2025-01-30T05:36:19.000Z"
