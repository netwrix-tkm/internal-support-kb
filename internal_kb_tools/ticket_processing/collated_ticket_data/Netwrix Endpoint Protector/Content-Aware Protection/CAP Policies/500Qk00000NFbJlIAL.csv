"500Qk00000NFbJlIAL","00439708","Support Ticket","Question Regarding 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' Policy in CAP","Hello,

There is a policy called 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' in CAP. Currently, I understand that 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' has been changed to a 'Windows APP'. However, even though there is only 'Microsoft Remote Desktop', if I check to block 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' in CAP, will the 'Windows APP' still be blocked by the same policy?

I am currently testing the blocking policy for 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' on a Mac, but it seems that the blocking is not working.","","'Microsoft Remote Desktop' has been changed to a by Windows APP.
Windows APP is not covered by Epp.","2025.04.24: The processname was added manually to the customer's server.
