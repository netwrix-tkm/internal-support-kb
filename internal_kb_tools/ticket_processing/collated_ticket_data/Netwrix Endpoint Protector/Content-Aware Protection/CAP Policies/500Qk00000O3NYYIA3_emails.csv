My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Thank you for reaching out with your questions regarding the use of Contextual Detection for multiple credit card types in Endpoint Protector.

Based the screenshots you shared, we recommend adding credit cards directly to a policy rather than relying solely on Global Contextual Detection.

By managing credit card detection per policy, you can:

• Easily select all relevant card types (e.g., Visa, Amex, Discover) within one rule set.

• Simplify troubleshooting if there are any issues with detection.

• Make centralized management more straightforward as new card types or rules need to be added in the future.

This approach not only streamlines configuration but also helps ensure that detection settings are both tailored to your needs and easier to maintain.

If you have any additional questions or would like assistance in setting up your policy-based credit card detection, please let me know. I’m here to help.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hi, you mean adding credit cards to the ""prefedefined content"" right? I am
just doing these contextual dictionary lists in case of future false
positives. We got false positives with ""phone number"", so I created
contextual lists with Flaviu. If I were to continue with credit card
contextual lists just in case we have false positives, would I need to have
an individual list per credit card type?

Could you also my question that I put on the ticket please. I'll paste it
below.

""When I had one contextual detection, i generated xml file and it showed
next to ""Applicable Contextual XML:"" Now I have 3 contextual lists, and
more will be coming. On the screenshot attatched, do i press generate, and
all 3 lists will be generated? Or is it only the latest one I worked on?""


Thanks.

To answer your questions, please consider the following information provided below.
Generating the Contextual XML:

• When you click “Generate” after adding or editing contextual lists, Endpoint Protector typically combines all active contextual rules into a single XML file.

• Even if you have created multiple lists (e.g., three separate contextual configurations), clicking “Generate” should pull them all together and produce one consolidated XML file, not just the most recent list.

• The main requirement is that each new or updated list has been saved properly so that it is recognized by the system. Once saved, clicking “Generate Contextual XML” rebuilds the entire rule set, including all lists and categories.

• If you’re ever unsure, you can download or view the generated XML file and confirm that all your newly added rules appear there before finalizing.

Choosing the “Type” for Credit Card Detection:

• Under the “Type” dropdown, you will see individual credit card functions such as “Amex,” “Discover,” “Visa,” etc. Each corresponds to a specific pattern or detection function.

• If you want your contextual rule to apply to multiple card types, you generally need to select each relevant type or use a more general “Credit_Card” function.

• Selecting only “Amex” would restrict your contextual detection to American Express cards, which means it would not detect Discover, Visa, or other card types.


Summary:

• Clicking “Generate” typically rebuilds the entire contextual XML file containing all defined lists, not just the last modified one.

• If you need to detect multiple credit card types, you must either select each one individually or use a broader “CAP policy” function.


Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
