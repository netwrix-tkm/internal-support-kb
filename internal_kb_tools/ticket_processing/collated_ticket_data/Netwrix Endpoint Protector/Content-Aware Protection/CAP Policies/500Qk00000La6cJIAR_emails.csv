Did you determine whether changing the email attachment size in the EPP global configuration prevented the user from being blocked? My engineers are asking if you can provide the screenshots from the user's perspective of being blocked. Also, to confirm that after the block message is displayed that the email and attachment are still being sent out? If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Could you please us provide this information?

Thank you.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

 

thanks for your help, sorry to pile on the issues, i should know better!

Hello Jeffrey,

Would you please create two separate cases for the issues you are experiencing with the Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and for policy that is using the ""SnippingTool.exe"". I can only raise one issue at a time to my internal team on each case. I will am submitting the issue with the Outlook Blocking Issue now, because I have the logs and added to this case, and will keep you posted on what my team finds.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

 

On Mon, Mar 3, 2025 at 2:12?PM Jeffrey Plotts <jplotts@blend.com> wrote:


a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question. 

Thank you.

Hello Ramon,
Thanks for the follow up. If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? Seeing as we use an external log collection server to monitor EPP traffic, it would be useful it it did report any actions regarding a block and remediate policy.

Thanks!

that works also. the current issue is of significant concern for me, it doesn't seem like the content aware policies are actually being applied to the active directory domains I'm selecting, so even if you have time today i'm available.

the issue I'm seeing is that, based on logging, all the users are getting dropped into a single user bucket and not across the policies based on AD membership I'd expect.

here's two images of the block from different users. the attachment size
didn't seem to affect the issues. Yes, it's my understanding that the
attachment was delivered even though it stated it was blocked.
Notifications for the client are enabled.

thanks for your help. I've removed the scanning of outlook body and
attachments, so this is less of an issue at the moment.

but the thing is more concerning is the issue with not getting blocked on
sending to those sites i shared. should i open a new ticket for that?

Thanks!

here's two images of the block from different users. the attachment size didn't seem to affect the issues. Yes, it's my understanding that the attachment was delivered even though it stated it was blocked. Notifications for the client are enabled.
 

thanks for your help. I've removed the scanning of outlook body and attachments, so this is less of an issue at the moment. 

 

but the thing is more concerning is the issue with not getting blocked on sending to those sites i shared. should i open a new ticket for that?

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Did you determine whether changing the email attachment size in the EPP global configuration prevented the user from being blocked? My engineers are asking if you can provide the screenshots from the user's perspective of being blocked. Also, to confirm that after the block message is displayed that the email and attachment are still being sent out? If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Could you please us provide this information?

Thank you.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

 

thanks for your help, sorry to pile on the issues, i should know better!

Hello Jeffrey,

Would you please create two separate cases for the issues you are experiencing with the Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and for policy that is using the ""SnippingTool.exe"". I can only raise one issue at a time to my internal team on each case. I will am submitting the issue with the Outlook Blocking Issue now, because I have the logs and added to this case, and will keep you posted on what my team finds.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

 

On Mon, Mar 3, 2025 at 2:12?PM Jeffrey Plotts <jplotts@blend.com> wrote:


a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question.

Hello Ramon,
Thanks for the follow up. If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? Seeing as we use an external log collection server to monitor EPP traffic, it would be useful it it did report any actions regarding a block and remediate policy.

Thanks!

that works also. the current issue is of significant concern for me, it doesn't seem like the content aware policies are actually being applied to the active directory domains I'm selecting, so even if you have time today i'm available.

Thank you for your patience as we analyzed the logs and reviewed the details you provided.

Here are our findings from the logs and screenshots:

Initial Inquiry:

You mentioned being ""blocked"" while using a report-only policy. However, the logs from March 5th indicate no blocking events. The 'Blend DLP Warning.png' screenshot reflects a standard notification indicating threat detection and reporting. The files in question were reportedly delivered successfully, so everything appears to have functioned as expected.

Review of New Screenshots:

'Blend DLP Warning.png' & 'Outlook Blend DLP Warning.png': These are normal notifications, alerting you to detected and reported threats, consistent with report-only policies.

'Windows Error.png': This error is unrelated to Endpoint Protector.

'Override.png' & 'EPP User remediation.png': These images are associated with a ""Block and Remediate"" policy, yet your description references ""report-only policies.""

'EPP UI.png': This image contains log reports from a device named DESKTOP-ML3HQ86; however, none of the logs uploaded correspond to this computer.
Recent Log Upload (March 13th):

The uploaded logs show interactions with a ""Block-only"" policy, despite your references to report-only policies.

In summary, the current evidence from logs and screen captures suggests normal behavior consistent with the policies applied.

If there is a misunderstanding in how these policies should function, or if multiple discrepancies exist, please clarify the issues more specifically.

Group related questions, logs, screenshots, and recordings together for easier analysis.

We're here to assist you in resolving these matters and ensuring the functionality aligns with your expectations. 

Should you need further clarification or have additional queries, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

here's two images of the block from different users. the attachment size didn't seem to affect the issues. Yes, it's my understanding that the attachment was delivered even though it stated it was blocked. Notifications for the client are enabled.
 

thanks for your help. I've removed the scanning of outlook body and attachments, so this is less of an issue at the moment. 

 

but the thing is more concerning is the issue with not getting blocked on sending to those sites i shared. should i open a new ticket for that?

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Did you determine whether changing the email attachment size in the EPP global configuration prevented the user from being blocked? My engineers are asking if you can provide the screenshots from the user's perspective of being blocked. Also, to confirm that after the block message is displayed that the email and attachment are still being sent out? If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Could you please us provide this information?

Thank you.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

 

thanks for your help, sorry to pile on the issues, i should know better!

I can only raise one issue at a time to my internal team on each case.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

 

On Mon, Mar 3, 2025 at 2:12?PM Jeffrey Plotts <jplotts@blend.com> wrote:


a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

 


On Thu, Feb 27, 2025 at 7:05?AM Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> wrote:


Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question. 

Thank you.

Thank you for your patience as we analyzed the logs and reviewed the details you provided.

Here are our findings from the logs and screenshots:

Initial Inquiry:

You mentioned being ""blocked"" while using a report-only policy. However, the logs from March 5th indicate no blocking events. The 'Blend DLP Warning.png' screenshot reflects a standard notification indicating threat detection and reporting. The files in question were reportedly delivered successfully, so everything appears to have functioned as expected.

Review of New Screenshots:

'Blend DLP Warning.png' & 'Outlook Blend DLP Warning.png': These are normal notifications, alerting you to detected and reported threats, consistent with report-only policies.

'Windows Error.png': This error is unrelated to Endpoint Protector.

'Override.png' & 'EPP User remediation.png': These images are associated with a ""Block and Remediate"" policy, yet your description references ""report-only policies.""

'EPP UI.png': This image contains log reports from a device named DESKTOP-ML3HQ86; however, none of the logs uploaded correspond to this computer.
Recent Log Upload (March 13th):

The uploaded logs show interactions with a ""Block-only"" policy, despite your references to report-only policies.

In summary, the current evidence from logs and screen captures suggests normal behavior consistent with the policies applied.

If there is a misunderstanding in how these policies should function, or if multiple discrepancies exist, please clarify the issues more specifically.

Group related questions, logs, screenshots, and recordings together for easier analysis.

We're here to assist you in resolving these matters and ensuring the functionality aligns with your expectations. 

Should you need further clarification or have additional queries, please let us know.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

here's two images of the block from different users. the attachment size didn't seem to affect the issues. Yes, it's my understanding that the attachment was delivered even though it stated it was blocked. Notifications for the client are enabled.
 

thanks for your help. I've removed the scanning of outlook body and attachments, so this is less of an issue at the moment. 

 

but the thing is more concerning is the issue with not getting blocked on sending to those sites i shared. should i open a new ticket for that?

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Did you determine whether changing the email attachment size in the EPP global configuration prevented the user from being blocked? My engineers are asking if you can provide the screenshots from the user's perspective of being blocked. Also, to confirm that after the block message is displayed that the email and attachment are still being sent out? If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Could you please us provide this information?

Thank you.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

 

thanks for your help, sorry to pile on the issues, i should know better!

Hello Jeffrey,

Would you please create two separate cases for the issues you are experiencing with the Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and for policy that is using the ""SnippingTool.exe"". I can only raise one issue at a time to my internal team on each case. I will am submitting the issue with the Outlook Blocking Issue now, because I have the logs and added to this case, and will keep you posted on what my team finds.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

 

On Mon, Mar 3, 2025 at 2:12?PM Jeffrey Plotts <jplotts@blend.com> wrote:


a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

 


On Thu, Feb 27, 2025 at 7:05?AM Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> wrote:


Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question. 

Thank you.

Hello Ramon,
Thanks for the follow up. If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? Seeing as we use an external log collection server to monitor EPP traffic, it would be useful it it did report any actions regarding a block and remediate policy.

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Thank you for your patience as we analyzed the logs and reviewed the details you provided.

Here are our findings from the logs and screenshots:

Initial Inquiry:

You mentioned being ""blocked"" while using a report-only policy. However, the logs from March 5th indicate no blocking events. The 'Blend DLP Warning.png' screenshot reflects a standard notification indicating threat detection and reporting. The files in question were reportedly delivered successfully, so everything appears to have functioned as expected.

Review of New Screenshots:

'Blend DLP Warning.png' & 'Outlook Blend DLP Warning.png': These are normal notifications, alerting you to detected and reported threats, consistent with report-only policies.

'Windows Error.png': This error is unrelated to Endpoint Protector.

'Override.png' & 'EPP User remediation.png': These images are associated with a ""Block and Remediate"" policy, yet your description references ""report-only policies.""

'EPP UI.png': This image contains log reports from a device named DESKTOP-ML3HQ86; however, none of the logs uploaded correspond to this computer.
Recent Log Upload (March 13th):

The uploaded logs show interactions with a ""Block-only"" policy, despite your references to report-only policies.

In summary, the current evidence from logs and screen captures suggests normal behavior consistent with the policies applied.

If there is a misunderstanding in how these policies should function, or if multiple discrepancies exist, please clarify the issues more specifically.

Group related questions, logs, screenshots, and recordings together for easier analysis.

We're here to assist you in resolving these matters and ensuring the functionality aligns with your expectations. 

Should you need further clarification or have additional queries, please let us know.

here's two images of the block from different users. the attachment size didn't seem to affect the issues. Yes, it's my understanding that the attachment was delivered even though it stated it was blocked. Notifications for the client are enabled.
 

thanks for your help. I've removed the scanning of outlook body and attachments, so this is less of an issue at the moment. 

 

but the thing is more concerning is the issue with not getting blocked on sending to those sites i shared. should i open a new ticket for that?

 

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Did you determine whether changing the email attachment size in the EPP global configuration prevented the user from being blocked? My engineers are asking if you can provide the screenshots from the user's perspective of being blocked. Also, to confirm that after the block message is displayed that the email and attachment are still being sent out? If notification pop-ups are not allowed, notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Could you please us provide this information?

Thank you.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

 

thanks for your help, sorry to pile on the issues, i should know better!

Hello Jeffrey,

Would you please create two separate cases for the issues you are experiencing with the Blocking Issue on Specific Sites and for policy that is using the ""SnippingTool.exe"". I can only raise one issue at a time to my internal team on each case. I will am submitting the issue with the Outlook Blocking Issue now, because I have the logs and added to this case, and will keep you posted on what my team finds.

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

 

On Mon, Mar 3, 2025 at 2:12?PM Jeffrey Plotts <jplotts@blend.com> wrote:


a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question. 

Thank you.

Hello Ramon,
Thanks for the follow up. If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? Seeing as we use an external log collection server to monitor EPP traffic, it would be useful it it did report any actions regarding a block and remediate policy.

Thanks!

Hello Jeffrey,

Thank you for your patience as we analyzed the logs and reviewed the details you provided.

Here are our findings from the logs and screenshots:

Initial Inquiry:

You mentioned being ""blocked"" while using a report-only policy. However, the logs from March 5th indicate no blocking events. The 'Blend DLP Warning.png' screenshot reflects a standard notification indicating threat detection and reporting. The files in question were reportedly delivered successfully, so everything appears to have functioned as expected.

Review of New Screenshots:

'Blend DLP Warning.png' & 'Outlook Blend DLP Warning.png': These are normal notifications, alerting you to detected and reported threats, consistent with report-only policies.

'Windows Error.png': This error is unrelated to Endpoint Protector.

'Override.png' & 'EPP User remediation.png': These images are associated with a ""Block and Remediate"" policy, yet your description references ""report-only policies.""

'EPP UI.png': This image contains log reports from a device named DESKTOP-ML3HQ86; however, none of the logs uploaded correspond to this computer.
Recent Log Upload (March 13th):

The uploaded logs show interactions with a ""Block-only"" policy, despite your references to report-only policies.

In summary, the current evidence from logs and screen captures suggests normal behavior consistent with the policies applied.

If there is a misunderstanding in how these policies should function, or if multiple discrepancies exist, please clarify the issues more specifically.

Group related questions, logs, screenshots, and recordings together for easier analysis.

We're here to assist you in resolving these matters and ensuring the functionality aligns with your expectations. 

Should you need further clarification or have additional queries, please let us know.

sure, thanks.
After reviewing the global configuration I believe the outlook issue may have been related to the size of the email attachment. our global config is currently set to 40MB. That could well have caused it. I reached out to the users who got blocked, asking how big the file was, but no response yet.

 

regarding the snipping tool. I found it relates to the ""print screen"" setting. once I disabled that in the blocking policy, it no longer warned, so that's fixed.

I will am submitting the issue with the Outlook Blocking Issue now, because I have the logs and added to this case, and will keep you posted on what my team finds.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Ramon, 
New issue!
When a policy is set to ""block and report"" the use of ""SnippingTool.exe"" is blocked. I've created an ""allow list"" entry for this application, but even with that entry applied to the policy i'm still getting blocked. it's not a typical EPP ""Blend DLP Warning"" message, it looks like a system message, like this



My users need to use this tool, so it's a hard stop for me regarding deploying Content Aware Blocking Policies.

a few points of clarification.
 

Pastebin and dlptest.com do get blocked, other sites don't. there are three sites that didn't block uploading data, paste.mozilla.org and paste.centos.org, as well as justpaste.it

 

the Outlook issue is that a few users are getting blocked but there's no reporting, but the only policies they're a part of are ""report only"". The end user informed me that the file did actually deliver to the targeted recipients. I provided the diagnostic logs in a previous email, attached is a screenshot fo the blocked file.

Hello Jeffrey,

During our remote session, you described experiencing two issues with Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.1.

The first issue is that users can paste sensitive information on Pastebin or similar sites, and you're looking for a way to prevent this. While Endpoint Protector blocks Windows native applications, I'll need to consult with my team to understand why it doesn't block Pastebin or similar sites, and I'll get back to you with an explanation.

The second issue pertains to a user using Outlook. Although the policies are configured to report rather than block actions, the user is still being blocked and reported. We checked the reports but couldn't determine which policy is causing this. You've sent a screenshot of the reported item. Could you please provide the diagnostic logs from when the user attempted to send the email in Outlook? Furthermore, the screenshot shows that the attachment is reported. Could you also provide a screenshot showing it being blocked and reported?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

thanks for your response, ,but if i go to dlptest.com and try to upload content i've pasted into the ""http test"" and ""https test"" ""text message"" and ""file upload"" areas it get blocked.

why doesn't it work the same for paste.mozilla.org?

Hello Jeffrey,
In response to your question about why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org is not being detected:

To prevent users from copying and pasting sensitive content onto paste.mozilla.org, you need to ensure that clipboard monitoring is enabled. The reason the content isn’t being caught is likely because clipboard monitoring is not currently active. When enabled, the EPP client software monitors all clipboard content on a computer, regardless of the destination.

Please see the Endpoint Protector 5.9.3.0 User Manual on page 78.

Note: This setting only applies to Copy operations.

When a Copy operation is performed, the Endpoint Protector Client inspects the clipboard content, and if it detects confidential information, it deletes it.

Consequently, the Paste operation won’t work because the clipboard content has been removed.

If clipboard monitoring is not enabled, the EPP client software will not monitor, block, or delete the PII content before it is pasted onto paste.mozilla.org.



Please let me know if this clarifies your question or if there are any other questions you have.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

thank you, that does answer my question.
Can you tell me why PII content pasted to paste.mozilla.org doesn't get ""caught""? When i monitor the clipboard via the same policy, if I copy the same data it gets blocked, but when clipboard monitoring isn't enabled I'm able to paste to that site and it doesn't get blocked or reported.

I'm assuming it's because it's actually doing local processing and is encrypted when it's saved up to the web, but just wanted to get clarification.

Thanks again!

Hello Jeffrey,

To answer your question, If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? The answer is yes on the initial block. A report is generated for the initial block, and yes a report is generated for the remediation of the file that has been set to remediate. The reports will be found in the EPP UI, under Reports and Analysis > Content Aware Report.

Example:



 As far as finding the status of the Justification of the remediated file, this information can be found in System Parameters > User Remediation > Justification List. From here you can see whether or not a file is set to remediate or not. You can also enable or disable the remediation from here by selecting Actions > Edit > Status (enable/disable), then save. 



Please let me know if this answers your question. 

Thank you.

Hello Ramon,
Thanks for the follow up. If a CAP is set to ""block and remediate"" is reporting enabled for that policy? Seeing as we use an external log collection server to monitor EPP traffic, it would be useful it it did report any actions regarding a block and remediate policy.

Thanks!

that works also. the current issue is of significant concern for me, it doesn't seem like the content aware policies are actually being applied to the active directory domains I'm selecting, so even if you have time today i'm available.

Can we please schedule another call, sooner the better?
the issue I'm seeing is that, based on logging, all the users are getting dropped into a single user bucket and not across the policies based on AD membership I'd expect.

thank you!

I was able to reproduce the file transfer and block, but don't see either my user name or the computer name in the EPP logs.
If you have time for a quick call i have availability today and tomorrow.
