A user has reported an issue where he receives regular pop up notification saying content has been blocked when he is not attempting to upload any content - just brose the web site.

The alert claims to have blocked a number of credit card number.  Not always the same number, but sometimes they are the same.

In the content aware report we see these reported as web-upload (no file name) and the events are not logged against any particular website, just Mozilla.

I'll send a screenshot so you can see.

How can we determine the cause of these please and will it be possible to exception if there is no web site shown in the report?

Thank you,
Dave","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-09T20:46:16.000Z"
