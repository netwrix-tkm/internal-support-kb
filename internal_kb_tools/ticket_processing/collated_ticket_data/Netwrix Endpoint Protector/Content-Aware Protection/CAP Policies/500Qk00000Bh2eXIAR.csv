"500Qk00000Bh2eXIAR","00411571","Support Ticket","Incorrect CAP Policy is triggered","Hello, 

sometimes we run into the issue, where the false CAP Policy gets triggered.
First I want to mention, that we only want to work with user right and therefore we have the setting ""Use user rights"" in ""System Settings"" set.
I have an example, where a user is excluded from a CAP Policy and despite that, exactly this policy gets triggered then.
Furthermore I had a look at the client in this example case and I tried to collect logs with the EPP SupportTool. Once I pressed ""Create Logs"" in the support tool, the policies get displayed CORRECTLY on the right and the CORRECT CAP policy gets triggered again. It seems like the EPP client just needed a push or a sync to know the correct CAP Policies again. I then collected the logs, but I don't think they will help you as the policies got correctly applied after the ""create logs"" button was pressed.
They are attached anyway.

I have several screenshots attached where you are able to see that ""pichlerg"" is excluded from the policy ""(Block) Conf. Code Red Filetransfer"", but exactly this policy gets triggered then in the logs. After the client has returned to the normal state and is aware of the right policies again, the correct policy with the higher priority ""(Remmediate) Conf. Code Red Filetransfer"" gets triggered. The correct events I highlighted in the screenshots with the yellow colour. And in the screenshots you can also see that after the pressing of ""Create Log File"" on the client, the correct policies get displayed again on the right of the supporttool. I have no idea why the false policy ""(Block) Conf. Code Red Filetransfer"" gets triggered before.

I hope you can help us with this issue as incorrectly applied CAP policies lead to frustrated users and we don't know what to do anymore. We can't find an issue in our configuration.
