Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I
would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to
leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also
ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an
administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please add the category websites to the DPI Monitored URL section of the CAP policy and test again with the content you are trying to prevent from uploading.

Also in regards of the latvian ID, please try to use the regex ^d{6}-d{5}$ and let me know how it goes.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hello! Another one question.
Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and
blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified *DPI URL Monitored
Categories *inside
the CAP, then the *blocking* will apply *only *to the websites listed under
those Categories?

Thank you!

In regards of your latest inquiry:

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?


The CAP policy which have the DPI URL Monitored Categories added will inspect only those websites for uploads, but that doesn't mean the blocking is disabled for the rest of your apps such as Outlook/Teams etc.

For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.

In regards of your previous inquiries, I will do some tests and get back to you.

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please add the category websites to the DPI Monitored URL section of the CAP policy and test again with the content you are trying to prevent from uploading.

Also in regards of the latvian ID, please try to use the regex ^d{6}-d{5}$ and let me know how it goes.

Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you!
That's exactly what I want. In this CAP policy, I only want to monitor one
specific web-resource. So this example fits my case very well.
""For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy
will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.""

And this policy will be the first one, and there might be restrictions
applied in other policies afterward.

To respond to your previous inquiries, basically the full URL should come up under Destination details column, not under the source one.

If you take a look below I have created a DPI category rule to block sendspace.com:
Depending on the destination URL that comes up in the destination details, you need to tweak the DPI Categories URL list  as below:


Then add it to the CAP policy:


As you can see below it is detected accordingly.



And on the user side it looks like this:



Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you!

That's exactly what I want. In this CAP policy, I only want to monitor one specific web-resource. So this example fits my case very well.

""For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.""

 

And this policy will be the first one, and there might be restrictions applied in other policies afterward.

Hello Elena,

In regards of your latest inquiry:

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?


The CAP policy which have the DPI URL Monitored Categories added will inspect only those websites for uploads, but that doesn't mean the blocking is disabled for the rest of your apps such as Outlook/Teams etc.

For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.

In regards of your previous inquiries, I will do some tests and get back to you.

Hello! Another one question.

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?

 

Thank you!

Hello Elena,

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please add the category websites to the DPI Monitored URL section of the CAP policy and test again with the content you are trying to prevent from uploading.

Also in regards of the latvian ID, please try to use the regex ^d{6}-d{5}$ and let me know how it goes.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Elena,

To respond to your previous inquiries, basically the full URL should come up under Destination details column, not under the source one.

If you take a look below I have created a DPI category rule to block sendspace.com:
Depending on the destination URL that comes up in the destination details, you need to tweak the DPI Categories URL list  as below:


Then add it to the CAP policy:


As you can see below it is detected accordingly.



And on the user side it looks like this:



Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you!

That's exactly what I want. In this CAP policy, I only want to monitor one specific web-resource. So this example fits my case very well.

""For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.""

 

And this policy will be the first one, and there might be restrictions applied in other policies afterward.

Hello Elena,

In regards of your latest inquiry:

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?


The CAP policy which have the DPI URL Monitored Categories added will inspect only those websites for uploads, but that doesn't mean the blocking is disabled for the rest of your apps such as Outlook/Teams etc.

For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.

In regards of your previous inquiries, I will do some tests and get back to you.

Hello! Another one question.

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?

 

Thank you!

Hello Elena,

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please add the category websites to the DPI Monitored URL section of the CAP policy and test again with the content you are trying to prevent from uploading.

Also in regards of the latvian ID, please try to use the regex ^d{6}-d{5}$ and let me know how it goes.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Marian! The policy worked for the test user. I enabled the policy for
all users yesterday, but I haven’t received a single log yet. I don’t know
why. I'm waiting.

Hello Marian! The policy worked for the test user. I enabled the policy for all users yesterday, but I haven’t received a single log yet. I don’t know why. I'm waiting.

Hello Elena,

To respond to your previous inquiries, basically the full URL should come up under Destination details column, not under the source one.

If you take a look below I have created a DPI category rule to block sendspace.com:
Depending on the destination URL that comes up in the destination details, you need to tweak the DPI Categories URL list  as below:


Then add it to the CAP policy:


As you can see below it is detected accordingly.



And on the user side it looks like this:



Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you!

That's exactly what I want. In this CAP policy, I only want to monitor one specific web-resource. So this example fits my case very well.

""For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.""

 

And this policy will be the first one, and there might be restrictions applied in other policies afterward.

Hello Elena,

In regards of your latest inquiry:

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?


The CAP policy which have the DPI URL Monitored Categories added will inspect only those websites for uploads, but that doesn't mean the blocking is disabled for the rest of your apps such as Outlook/Teams etc.

For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.

In regards of your previous inquiries, I will do some tests and get back to you.

Hello! Another one question.

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?

Hello Elena,

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please add the category websites to the DPI Monitored URL section of the CAP policy and test again with the content you are trying to prevent from uploading.

Also in regards of the latvian ID, please try to use the regex ^d{6}-d{5}$ and let me know how it goes.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello, Marian!

Thank you for scheduling the meeting. I had agreed to it earlier, but I would now like to kindly request a rescheduling. Unfortunately, I have to leave and will only be back on Monday.

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Elena,

To respond to your previous inquiries, basically the full URL should come up under Destination details column, not under the source one.

If you take a look below I have created a DPI category rule to block sendspace.com:
Depending on the destination URL that comes up in the destination details, you need to tweak the DPI Categories URL list  as below:


Then add it to the CAP policy:


As you can see below it is detected accordingly.



And on the user side it looks like this:

Thank you!

That's exactly what I want. In this CAP policy, I only want to monitor one specific web-resource. So this example fits my case very well.

""For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.""

 

And this policy will be the first one, and there might be restrictions applied in other policies afterward.

Hello Elena,

In regards of your latest inquiry:

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?


The CAP policy which have the DPI URL Monitored Categories added will inspect only those websites for uploads, but that doesn't mean the blocking is disabled for the rest of your apps such as Outlook/Teams etc.

For example: If you added in the DPI monitored list WeTransfer, the policy will check only for WeTransfer but will allow it for DropBox.

In regards of your previous inquiries, I will do some tests and get back to you.

Did I understand correctly that if sensitive content is monitored and blocked by the CAP policy, and I specified DPI URL Monitored Categories inside the CAP, then the blocking will apply only to the websites listed under those Categories?

Therefore, I suggest we meet next week, starting from Tuesday. I’m also ready to collect the logs on the client machine — I now have an administrator credentials.
