"500Qk00000EJlJOIA1","00417833","Support Ticket","POC: Issues when file with a specific name is uploaded to Zimbra webmail","Hi team,

We are in a POC with this prospect - Nutri Lacteos San Antonio and we are trying to upload a file with a specific name.
We added the name to Denylist and Allowlist - denylist - file name and then to a CAP policy.
The file is not blocked. When we try with a file type it is blocked.
The web browsers are Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
