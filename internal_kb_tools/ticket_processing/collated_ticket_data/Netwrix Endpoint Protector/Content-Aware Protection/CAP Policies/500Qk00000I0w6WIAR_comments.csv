Hi @WaitingOnEngineer

I have done several tests on this case. On my side, the Canadian SIN numbers are reported when printing from Notepad, MS Word etc.

Then, I tested using the reprovision.db files provided with the attached logs. At first I thought that the case is reproducing on my side, but then I noticed that contextual rules are applied for the Canadian SIN detection. Afterwards, by adding the expected keywords next to the PIIs, the context was matched and the threats were reported as expected.

However, in the log files that were provided, I could not see any report related to the Canada SIN (even if the context is not matched for a PII, this would be logged). 

Could you please provide a test file with Canada SIN numbers just to make sure that the tested PIIs match our detection rules? 

Also, can you do some additional tests with basic file uploads (e.g. on dlptest.endpointprotector.com or so) containing Canada SIN, both with DPI on and off, and provide feedback on these tests?

Thank you!

Hello @WaitingOnEngineer, 

It seems that the samples that were used in the tests do not match with our Canada SIN detection implementation. The format is the right one (DDD-DDD-DDD), but we also have a checksum verification and for the provided samples, that results into invalid PIIs.

Hello,

In the attachments link, I added a file containing samples that work with our detection (test_sin_samples.txt).

I will also describe the checksum calculation that we do, but please only use this information internally. The rules should not be shared externally unless that is approved by product.

First, we accept both DDD DDD DDD and DDD-DDD-DDD formats for this PII.
The first digit should not be 8.
For the checksum, we multiply each digit of the PII by its corresponding weight from {1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1}. If we have a multiplications which results into a number greater than 9, then we sum up its digits in order to obtain another digit. Then we do the sum of these results. In order for the PII to be valid, the final result has to be divisible by 10.

Say we have the PII 130-692-544. 
We multiply each of its digits by the corresponding weight and sum up the results: 
1 + 6 + 0 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 4 = 40
Note:  For 6*2=12 we have 3 when we do the sum, because 12 > 9 and for that we sum up the digits and obtain 1+2=3.


Thank you!

Hi, @WaitingOnEngineer

I must have overlooked that one sample when I searched for the valid PIIs that I sent to you. That one specifically is invalid unfortunately.

I checked it now with both our tester and manually, according to the detection rule described before, and the checksum is not matching, indeed, for the PII 375 814 356. As for the other 3 samples I attached, they work as expected as the checksum is matching.

Besides these PIIs, in the file CAN_Sin_Test_data that you attached, there is also another PII that should not trigger: 401-318-448.


Thank you!
