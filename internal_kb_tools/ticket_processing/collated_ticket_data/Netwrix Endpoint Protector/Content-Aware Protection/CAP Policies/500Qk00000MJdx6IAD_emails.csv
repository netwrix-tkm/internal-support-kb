Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today's session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.



Kind Regards,

Rajat

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,

 

Thank you for you time and help in today’s session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.

 

I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.

 

Kind Regards,

Rajat

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today. 
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"". 
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today's session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.



Kind Regards,

Rajat

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today's session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today's session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today’s session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.



Kind Regards,

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,



Thank you for you time and help in today's session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.



I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today.
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"".
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Hi André,

 

Thank you for you time and help in today’s session. In addition to the changes we made today, we will work towards refining Content Aware Protection policies to improve detection accuracy.

 

I will reach out if we face any issues while we roll out the policies to test users.

 

Kind Regards,

Rajat

Hi Rajat,

Thank you for your time in our remote session today. 
As discussed in our call please monitor the event logs and behavior of Endpoint Protector after we have upgraded the EPP client to version 6.2.4.2000.
We have also enabled debug logs on a group level for the endpoint computers that will be used for testing (please add the computers to the group to inherit the settings.  We enabled MTP scanning (requires a system restart) and we have enabled ""Extended source code detection"". 
With these settings applied, you will also refine the Content Aware Protection policies and observe if the detections by Endpoint Protector improved with accuracy.


Kind regards

Thank you  for your email.  In our remote session yesterday we went over the configurations for Content Aware Protection policies and confirmed that the configurations were correct for the customer's use case of blocking sensitive information via file uploads and clipboard.  I noticed that the Endpoint Client service stopped running for some reason and I restarted the service manually via CLI in terminal, the CAP policy was usefully enforced after the restart of the EPP service.

For Block and Remediation we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally, which I did and now I would like to provide feedback on this.
In order for the remediation to work the customer would need to turn of the paste restriction options under ""Clipboard"", these would be the last two options shown in the screenshot.  Please ask the customer to modify the Clipboard switches to be identical to what is shown in the below screenshot and then to retest the scenario and see if they are able to remediate the Clipboard action as shown in the below screenshot. 




Please let me know the outcome after the modification to Clipboard in the Content Aware Protection policy.

Hi Sai,

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing me with information. It looks like we are being recommended to turn off the following under the Clipboard options-


  1.  Apply Paste restrictions to all monitored applications
  2.  Extend Paste restrictions to below applications

Wouldn't turning off these options limit our monitoring ability? Ideally, we would like to enforce paste restrictions to all application. I will test the recommendation you have made, but please confirm if this limits our monitoring ability.

Also, we have not sent the log files to Andre regarding this issue yet. Please let me know if Andre would require the logs files and how can we share the files with him.

Kind Regards,
Rajat

Hello Sai,

Thank you  for your email.  In our remote session yesterday we went over the configurations for Content Aware Protection policies and confirmed that the configurations were correct for the customer's use case of blocking sensitive information via file uploads and clipboard.  I noticed that the Endpoint Client service stopped running for some reason and I restarted the service manually via CLI in terminal, the CAP policy was usefully enforced after the restart of the EPP service.

For Block and Remediation we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally, which I did and now I would like to provide feedback on this.
In order for the remediation to work the customer would need to turn of the paste restriction options under ""Clipboard"", these would be the last two options shown in the screenshot.  Please ask the customer to modify the Clipboard switches to be identical to what is shown in the below screenshot and then to retest the scenario and see if they are able to remediate the Clipboard action as shown in the below screenshot.


[cid:image004.png@01DB9827.38AF2330]

Please let me know the outcome after the modification to Clipboard in the Content Aware Protection policy.



Kind regards

Hi Sai, 

  

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing me with information. It looks like we are being recommended to turn off the following under the Clipboard options– 

  


	Apply Paste restrictions to all monitored applications 
	Extend Paste restrictions to below applications 


  

Wouldn’t turning off these options limit our monitoring ability? Ideally, we would like to enforce paste restrictions to all application. I will test the recommendation you have made, but please confirm if this limits our monitoring ability. 

  

Also, we have not sent the log files to Andre regarding this issue yet. Please let me know if Andre would require the logs files and how can we share the files with him. 

  

Kind Regards, 

Rajat

The proposed workaround won't affect your ability to monitor the clipboard contents.  The ""paste restricted apps"" feature only limits the clipboard blocking to certain applications.

Hi Sai,



Hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing me with information. It looks like we are being recommended to turn off the following under the Clipboard options–



  1.  Apply Paste restrictions to all monitored applications
  2.  Extend Paste restrictions to below applications



Wouldn’t turning off these options limit our monitoring ability? Ideally, we would like to enforce paste restrictions to all application. I will test the recommendation you have made, but please confirm if this limits our monitoring ability.



Also, we have not sent the log files to Andre regarding this issue yet. Please let me know if Andre would require the logs files and how can we share the files with him.



Kind Regards,

Rajat

Dear Rajat sir,



I hope you doing well.



Please let me know the outcome after the modification to Clipboard in the Content Aware Protection policy.



So that we can move forward to closure.

Dear Rajat sir,



In our Last remote session with EPP team, we went over the configurations for Content Aware Protection policies and confirmed that the configurations were correct for the customer's use case of blocking sensitive information via file uploads and clipboard.  I noticed that the Endpoint Client service stopped running for some reason and I restarted the service manually via CLI in terminal, the CAP policy was usefully enforced after the restart of the EPP service.

For Block and Remediation, we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally, which I did and now I would like to provide feedback on this.
In order for the remediation to work the customer would need to turn of the paste restriction options under ""Clipboard"", these would be the last two options shown in the screenshot.  Please ask the customer to modify the Clipboard switches to be identical to what is shown in the below screenshot and then to retest the scenario and see if they are able to remediate the Clipboard action as shown in the below screenshot.
