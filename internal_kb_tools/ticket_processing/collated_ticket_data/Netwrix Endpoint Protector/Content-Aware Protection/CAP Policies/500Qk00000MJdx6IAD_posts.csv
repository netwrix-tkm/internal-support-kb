For Block and Remediation we observed that for clipboard actions it did not give the option to remediate.  The action was left with me to retest this scenario internally.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-12T12:02:19.000Z"

In order for the remediation to work the customer would need to turn of the paste restriction options under ""Clipboard"", these would be the last two options shown in the screenshot.  We asked the customer to modify the Clipboard switches to be identical to what is shown in the below screenshot and then to retest the scenario and see if they are able to remediate the Clipboard action as shown in the below screenshot.

The customer would need to let us know the outcome after the modification to Clipboard in the Content Aware Protection policy.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-12T12:03:13.000Z"
