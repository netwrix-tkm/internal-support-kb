We are in a POC with VenturesSoft and they are facing several issues: one of them is that the file types and / or confidential data are not being blocked on Teams. They are being blocked on other exit points. Also, they cannot block the websites access by using our denylist for websites.

Could you please help us with this?
Please note that the prospect-s name is VenturesSoft. This is the SF link account: <a href='https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001Qk00000IzqybIAB/view' target='_blank'>https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/001Qk00000IzqybIAB/view</a>

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-06T10:04:39.000Z"
