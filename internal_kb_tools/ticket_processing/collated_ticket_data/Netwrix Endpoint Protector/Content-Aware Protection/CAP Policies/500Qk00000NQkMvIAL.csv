- some classic outlook replies get blocked
- outlook new emails get sent
- disabled OCR, but still didn’t send
- one email gets blocked for containing Haskell, but it doesn’t contain any
- customer uses Crowdstrike - he couldn't turn it off during the remote
- Teams replies get blocked as well - only the replies, new messages can be sent
- the blocked messages show up as HTML in the logs report
- tried multiple DPI settings, but without success
- DPI was turned on and off for Teams during testing
- 1st log for email (Log.zip)
- 2nd log for teams (log-1.zip)

After checking the logs we found out that issues were caused as follows:
1. Outlook blocked email
- the email was blocked because of the long subject, the text between the brackets - [Request ID :##62346##] |RE: [Request ID :=#62346##] |RE: [Request ID :##62346##] |RE: [Request ID:##623469*] |RE: [Request ID :##62346##] - is similar to a Haskell string.
- It is also the reason this was the only email that was blocked.
2. Teams replies
- Teams replies are formatted as HTML and that is why the EPP client picked it up as HTML code.
- We recommend removing HTML completely from the policy, because most applications use if for communication, and it will cause a lot of false positives; it only needs to be used if you're writing HTML code.
