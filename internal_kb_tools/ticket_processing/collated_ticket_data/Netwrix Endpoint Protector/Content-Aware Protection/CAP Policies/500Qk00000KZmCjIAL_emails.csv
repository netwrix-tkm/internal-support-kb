I add below the steps for collecting logs from a MacOS EPP machine:
 
1. Open terminal and run :
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
 
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
 
2. Press on the EPP Client Icon option 'Update policies now' and then reproduce the problematic scenario.
  + Run in a terminal (this will copy the files to desktop):
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
 
3. Send us an archive with eppclient.log, eppsslsplit.log, reprovision.db, rights.s3db and netdlp_settings.json files which are located on the Desktop.

If the client does not scan by contents, does that mean this feature is practically non-existent?

ACE, bz2, xz, and xar file formats are also listed as check items.

If they are not supported, why do they exist?

Some archive formats are supported (like .zip, .gz), these are scanned by contents. The other unsupported formats are not scanned by contents.

The checkboxes related to ACE/xz/etc refer to the mimetype. So, when a file is determined to be an ACE archive, even if we do not support scanning the contents, we know that it is an ACE archive and the policy could choose to block ACE archives.

I cannot understand.

If it is an unsupported format, shouldn’t it be impossible to select it in “CAP”?

You mentioned ACE archive as an example, but I am asking because it is not being blocked.

For example, with a zip file:
      1.    I did not check the checkbox for blocking zip archive files.
      2.    Inside the zip archive, there are files such as pdf, jpg, and gif.
      3.    I have checked the checkboxes to block pdf, jpg, and gif files.
      4.    pdf and jpg files are blocked, but gif files are not blocked.

Even if I do not check the option to block zip files, it still gets blocked because of the contents inside.
However, some files are blocked, and some are not.

Additionally, for archive files like 7z or rar, there are checkboxes available, but none of them are blocked.

Do you understand what I mean?
And please explain it in a simpler way.

I checked the Netwrix user manual, but there is no proper explanation of what a MIME type is.

Please do not forget that I am asking because the archive file is recognized, and even when I select to block both the archive file and its contents, it is not being blocked

MIME type refers to the FIle type. For example, if you select text file MIME type, the policy blocks .txt files without checking the contents.
In the same way, if you select a ZIP MIME type, .zip files will be blocked without checking the contents.
If ZIP MIME type is not selected, we still access the archive to check its content. ( ex. If the text file MIME type is selected and present in the zip fil,e it will be blocked.)
Epp can do this for .rar, .tar, .gz and .zip archives.
For other archives it is not possible to check the contents, but we can still see the archive type and block it if you have the respective MIME type selected.

You mentioned gif files are not seen in the zip file. Can you please confirm if you tested this when collecting the logs?


Kind regards

Yes, not only GIF but other files were also not visible.
When I sent the logs, the method I tested was as follows:
I created files for (csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp) one by one and then compressed them into (zip, 7z, ace, rar, tar, bz2, gz, xz, xar) archive files for testing.

ex)
zip - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp
7z - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp

I created and tested them like this.

This is the issue I encountered:
For example, when I tested with all the file types checked but not checking the zip file type, I found that csv, xlsx, pptx, docx files were shown as blocked in the logs, but gif, bmp, and pdf were not shown as blocked. (This is an example; the actual blocked files may need to be reviewed.)

And

Is MIME type just used to indicate the file type?
For file types other than .rar, .tar, .gz, and .zip, does it mean content cannot be checked?","Netwrix Support Ticket #431950 - Issue with Compressed Files Not Being Blocked or Logged in Content Aware Protection (CAP) Policy","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","daehee kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-14T05:17:18.000Z","true"

We will cehck this and get back to you.

- Yes.
For file types other than .rar, .tar, .gz, and .zip, does it mean content cannot be checked?
The content will not be checked because the file will be blocked based on its type. If the file is blocked, there is no need to check the content.

When I sent the logs, the method I tested was as follows:
I created files for (csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp) one by one and then compressed them into (zip, 7z, ace, rar, tar, bz2, gz, xz, xar) archive files for testing.

ex)
zip - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp
7z - csv, xlsx, pptx, docx, eml, gif, bmp, pdf, txt, ico, pub, webp

I created and tested them like this.

This is the issue I encountered:
For example, when I tested with all the file types checked but not checking the zip file type, I found that csv, xlsx, pptx, docx files were shown as blocked in the logs, but gif, bmp, and pdf were not shown as blocked. (This is an example; the actual blocked files may need to be reviewed.)

And

Is MIME type just used to indicate the file type?
For file types other than .rar, .tar, .gz, and .zip, does it mean content cannot be checked?","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #431950 - Issue with Compressed Files Not Being Blocked or Logged in Content Aware Protection (CAP) Policy    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0KZmCj:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","","andrei.pop@netwrix.com","false","2025-03-14T07:08:34.000Z","true"

Thank you for your answer.
Sorry to ask again, but I want to make sure and ask clearly.

If the policy is applied to archive files like test1 image files, do the files inside the archive appear in the logs?
If the policy is applied to archive files like test2 image files, the files inside the archive do not appear in the logs, right?

When applying the policy to ""rar, .tar, .gz, .zip"" archive files like test1, sometimes the files inside are visible, and sometimes they are not.","Netwrix Support Ticket #431950 - Issue with Compressed Files Not Being Blocked or Logged in Content Aware Protection (CAP) Policy","dhkim@cososyssolution.co.kr","daehee kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-17T05:36:36.000Z","true"

I hope you are well.
We received a request from the engineering team, can you please share the server settings for deny lists and allow lists (especially those for mime types)?

Thank you,
