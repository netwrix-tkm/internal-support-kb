Checked the intercept traffic VPN and it was enabled.
Checked the network extension and it was missing indeed.
Asked to restart and check again but that did not work.
He did not had anymore time to take a look and we agreed to call back tomorrow at 12:30  PM IST.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-06T15:17:37.000Z"

Connected remote and went to allow the eppclient to have access to the full disk and accessibility.
Tried to check again for network extension but it was missing completely.
Also we tried to allow the eppnotifier but could not find it at all being present under security and privacy nor under notifications.
Tried to uninstall the app but client messed it by typing in the wrong password multiple times and asked to reschedule for later today while he takes care of this password issue.
Asked him to just uninstall the app so we can try a fresh installation.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-07T08:11:45.000Z"

Also we disabled/enabled back the intercept VPN from the computer settings, and updated the policy on the MAC and now the network extension was enabled accordingly.
We tried multiple portals and all of them were properly blocked.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-07T11:55:52.000Z"
