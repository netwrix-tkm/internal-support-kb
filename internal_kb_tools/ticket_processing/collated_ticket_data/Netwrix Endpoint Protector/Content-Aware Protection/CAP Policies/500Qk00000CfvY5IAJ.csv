Items related to the topics below that we need answers to from the support team

Note: We are trying to do the process of opening tickets in the support system, we have been trying for the last few weeks, but there is some problem in the system and customers are no longer waiting, so please just give us some feedback on the questions below.

1. Confidentiality Policy in the body of the email: what is the best and definitive alternative for COSOSYS?

The suggestion is to disable the policy so as not to read the word “confidential” in the body of the email and maintain the rule for everything else as normal.

Explanation: Regarding the confidentiality policy, it is standard for our email signatures to contain the word “confidential”, and this results in identification in the body of the email, we would like to have the confidentiality protection policy, but excluding identification the body of emails stores attachments and other forms of documents. How could we do this, or a better way to improve the user interface/interaction?

 2. Google Drive: When working on a file for a long time, the tool prompts you for the justification screen.

 What is the best way and definitive alternative for COSOSYS for this situation?

 Explanation: In this case, when we use Google Drive and the Google platform's online office tools to edit documents through the platform's office applications, the DLP application records continuous hits of upload violations throughout the document editing, either for some minutes or throughout the working day.

 We would like to avoid this insistent and constant identification in our documents that are hosted on our Google platform, or a better way to improve the user interface/interaction.","","","","CAP was configured","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","46.9","Closed - Resolved","ESCALE Brasil","Tiago Guerra","2024-07-04T15:50:55.000Z","2024-08-20T12:53:14.000Z"
