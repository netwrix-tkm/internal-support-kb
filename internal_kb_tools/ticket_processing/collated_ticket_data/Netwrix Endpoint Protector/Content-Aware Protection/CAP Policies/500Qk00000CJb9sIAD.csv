Customer name is PrivatBank.
They faced an issue that if they needed to exclude one single computer from CAP policy, the Department related to this PC is also excluding from CAP policy.
I will attach video.
Is there a possibility to exclude one single PC from ALL policies, but to let the Department stay included?","","The customer would like to be able to manage all the entities from all the policies at the same time","A feature request was opened for this ticket","The feature request was refused.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","230.1","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","Danylo Didenko","2024-06-26T11:07:54.000Z","2025-02-11T13:13:14.000Z"
