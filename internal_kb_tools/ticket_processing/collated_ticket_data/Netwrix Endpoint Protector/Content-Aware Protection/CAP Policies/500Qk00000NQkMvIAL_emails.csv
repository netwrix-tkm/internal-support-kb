Thank you for your time today!

We checked the logs and the screenshots internally and we found the following:
1. Outlook blocked email
- the email was blocked because of the long subject, the text between the brackets - [Request ID :##62346##] |RE: [Request ID :=#62346##] |RE: [Request ID :##62346##] |RE: [Request ID:##623469*] |RE: [Request ID :##62346##] - is similar to a Haskell string.
- It is also the reason this was the only email that was blocked.

2. Teams replies
- Teams replies are formatted as HTML and that is why the EPP client picked it up as HTML code.
- We recommend removing HTML completely from the policy, because most applications use if for communication, and it will cause a lot of false positives; it only needs to be used if you're writing HTML code.
