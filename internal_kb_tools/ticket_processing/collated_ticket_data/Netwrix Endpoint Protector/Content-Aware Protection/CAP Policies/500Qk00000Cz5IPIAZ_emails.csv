Thank you for your email.
For the CAP policies this can be marked as an exit point under Web Browsers and be monitored like the rest of the browsers.
As for E-discovery, exit points are not available- since it scans only the elements from the computer in question.
For more info on the Ediscovery module, please find the manual here https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_User_Manual_EN.pdf page 107/299 chapter
