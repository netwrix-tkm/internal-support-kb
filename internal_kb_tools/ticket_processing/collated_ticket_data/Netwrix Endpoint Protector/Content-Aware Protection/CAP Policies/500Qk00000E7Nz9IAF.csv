We are in a POC with Airpak. They configured a custom policy in CAP, adding a threshold of 3 for a dictionary list added to Predefined content. The policy did not block the file when the threshold was enabled but it blocked it when the threshold was changed to 1. The file contained 6 or 7 codes that should have been reported. Could an engineer join the call that we have scheduled for today at 7pm Romania time?

Spanish support is needed so I will be helping with the translation. 

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","selected the threshold from the Policy Info section","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Airpak","Stefania Oltean","2024-08-07T11:39:06.000Z","2024-08-07T16:40:08.000Z"
