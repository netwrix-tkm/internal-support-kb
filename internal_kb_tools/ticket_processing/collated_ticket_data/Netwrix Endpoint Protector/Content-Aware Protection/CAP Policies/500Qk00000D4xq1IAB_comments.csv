I created a CAP log on my computer with the destination being Telegram Desktop. The CAP log details are displayed.

I suggest that someone from the QA team should also test the case.
Additional information can be found in the attached video.

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan, @Krzysztof Staszalek @Oana-Cristina Rus 
Reproduced the issue by following the steps from the Screen recording. Reproduced first on a 5920 server and the equivalent client on Ubuntu 22.04, then on 5940 with the matching client for Windows 10 x64. The culprit seems to be the ""&"" character from the policy name. When filtering in the CAP reports after the policy name the ""No matching records found"" message will be displayed in the log details if the policy name contains the ""&"" character. Logged a new issue which is linked to this ticket. Created a policy with normal characters and the log details were displayed correctly.
