Thank you for reaching out to us.
To exclude that sync that you were mentioning can you please test the scenario on a computer where you uninstall and then reinstall the EPP client?
This should perform a re-register of the client certificate and should give us an idea if that was causing the false-positive.

Hello,

unfortunately it is not that easy to reproduce as it only occurs sometimes.
I can try to uninstall and install the client and hope for it to happen again.

But I can't follow you on why exactly to re-install the client. Do you think that maybe the client certificate is ""broken"" and that this is causing this issue?
Should I turn on some logging or anything else?

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

the issue didn't appear on the first client, but we have another client which is having this bug.
As you can see ""kleinhenz"" is excluded from this policy, but exactly this one is triggered:
[cid:image001.png@01DAC227.685D77C0]

[cid:image002.png@01DAC227.685D77C0]


The reinstallation of the client is not a satisfactory solution as the problem can appear on any other client of our soon 1000 clients.
We need to solve this issue as soon as possible because our colleagues are sometimes not able to send critical files, wich they should be allowed to.

Thank you in advance!

Hello,

unfortunately it is not that easy to reproduce as it only occurs sometimes.
I can try to uninstall and install the client and hope for it to happen again.

But I can't follow you on why exactly to re-install the client. Do you think that maybe the client certificate is ""broken"" and that this is causing this issue?
Should I turn on some logging or anything else?

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
To exclude that sync that you were mentioning can you please test the scenario on a computer where you uninstall and then reinstall the EPP client?
This should perform a re-register of the client certificate and should give us an idea if that was causing the false-positive.

Thank you for your reply.
Could you please tell me your availability for next week so that we can arrange a remote session via Zoom to perform a re-registration of all the clients and to further investigate this matter? 
For the remote session you will need to have Putty installed on your computer as I would need to access the server via SSH.
 
Have a nice day,

Hello,

 

the issue didn’t appear on the first client, but we have another client which is having this bug.

As you can see “kleinhenz” is excluded from this policy, but exactly this one is triggered:



 



 


 

The reinstallation of the client is not a satisfactory solution as the problem can appear on any other client of our soon 1000 clients.

We need to solve this issue as soon as possible because our colleagues are sometimes not able to send critical files, wich they should be allowed to.

 

Thank you in advance!

 

Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I can think of a hypothesis that the client is kind of blocked and when a service restart is performed (like in the case of the Support tool) to be reengaged.
But please try the mentioned scenario after reinstalling the client and let us know if it occurs again.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
Could you please tell me your availability for next week so that we can arrange a remote session via Zoom to perform a re-registration of all the clients and to further investigate this matter? 
For the remote session you will need to have Putty installed on your computer as I would need to access the server via SSH.
 
Have a nice day,
Best regards,

Hello,

 

the issue didn’t appear on the first client, but we have another client which is having this bug.

As you can see “kleinhenz” is excluded from this policy, but exactly this one is triggered:



 



 


 

The reinstallation of the client is not a satisfactory solution as the problem can appear on any other client of our soon 1000 clients.

We need to solve this issue as soon as possible because our colleagues are sometimes not able to send critical files, wich they should be allowed to.

 

Thank you in advance!

 

Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I can think of a hypothesis that the client is kind of blocked and when a service restart is performed (like in the case of the Support tool) to be reengaged.
But please try the mentioned scenario after reinstalling the client and let us know if it occurs again.

Hello,

 

unfortunately it is not that easy to reproduce as it only occurs sometimes.

I can try to uninstall and install the client and hope for it to happen again.

 

But I can’t follow you on why exactly to re-install the client. Do you think that maybe the client certificate is “broken” and that this is causing this issue?

Should I turn on some logging or anything else?

 

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
To exclude that sync that you were mentioning can you please test the scenario on a computer where you uninstall and then reinstall the EPP client?
This should perform a re-register of the client certificate and should give us an idea if that was causing the false-positive.

Hello,

 

the issue didn’t appear on the first client, but we have another client which is having this bug.

As you can see “kleinhenz” is excluded from this policy, but exactly this one is triggered:



 



 


 

The reinstallation of the client is not a satisfactory solution as the problem can appear on any other client of our soon 1000 clients.

We need to solve this issue as soon as possible because our colleagues are sometimes not able to send critical files, wich they should be allowed to.

 

Thank you in advance!

 

Best regards,

Hello,

 

ok I reinstalled the client – let’s wait if it happens again.

I will get back to you if it happens again, is that ok?

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I can think of a hypothesis that the client is kind of blocked and when a service restart is performed (like in the case of the Support tool) to be reengaged.
But please try the mentioned scenario after reinstalling the client and let us know if it occurs again.

Hello,

 

unfortunately it is not that easy to reproduce as it only occurs sometimes.

I can try to uninstall and install the client and hope for it to happen again.

 

But I can’t follow you on why exactly to re-install the client. Do you think that maybe the client certificate is “broken” and that this is causing this issue?

Should I turn on some logging or anything else?

 

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
To exclude that sync that you were mentioning can you please test the scenario on a computer where you uninstall and then reinstall the EPP client?
This should perform a re-register of the client certificate and should give us an idea if that was causing the false-positive.

Hello,

I sent you the following. I attached a zip file in my original message, but I will exclude that in this message - so hopefully it goes through.

MESSAGE:

Hello,

unfortunately the change we made last Wednesday in the remote session is causing troubles now.


  *   Since then, we are not receiving ANY Content Aware Reports. I tried it myself to upload a file a few minutes ago and no log is visible on the server:
[cid:image001.png@01DACBC1.F4E4E860]



  *   Since then, we are not receiving any Log Entries other than ""Policies Received"". Neither ""User Login"", nor ""USB conncted"", nor ""User logout"" ... nothing. I also tried it a few minutes ago(Login and plugin a USB stick) and no logs appear.

Since then, we are not receiving ANY File Tracing reports either:
[cid:image003.png@01DACBC1.F4E4E860]

I am not sure if anything else is not working anymore. Please assist as soon as possible because Logs are essential in our current enrollment phase.

PS: As mentioned, I turned on my testclient, I logged in, tried to upload something with remediaten and plugged in a USB stick and NO logs appear on the EPP server - if you want to see these client logs, I attached them.


Thank you very much!

Hello,

I sent you the following. I attached a zip file in my original message, but I will exclude that in this message - so hopefully it goes through.

MESSAGE:

Hello,

unfortunately the change we made last Wednesday in the remote session is causing troubles now.


  1.  Since then, we are not receiving ANY Content Aware Reports. I tried it myself to upload a file a few minutes ago and no log is visible on the server:

Hello,

 

I sent you the following. I attached a zip file in my original message, but I will exclude that in this message – so hopefully it goes through.

 

MESSAGE:

 

Hello,

 

unfortunately the change we made last Wednesday in the remote session is causing troubles now.

 


	Since then, we are not receiving ANY Content Aware Reports. I tried it myself to upload a file a few minutes ago and no log is visible on the server: 




 

 


	Since then, we are not receiving any Log Entries other than “Policies Received”. Neither “User Login”, nor “USB conncted”, nor “User logout” … nothing. I also tried it a few minutes ago(Login and plugin a USB stick) and no logs appear. 




 

 

Since then, we are not receiving ANY File Tracing reports either:



 

I am not sure if anything else is not working anymore. Please assist as soon as possible because Logs are essential in our current enrollment phase.

 

PS: As mentioned, I turned on my testclient, I logged in, tried to upload something with remediaten and plugged in a USB stick and NO logs appear on the EPP server – if you want to see these client logs, I attached them.

 

 

Thank you very much!

Hello,

I just wanted to give you an update on this topic. We are receiving the logs again, so this looks fine.
Concerning the original ticket #411571 ""Incorrect CAP Policy is triggered"" - we did not experience it again, so I suggest we leave it this way and should we have some problems again, I will contact you.
Is that ok?

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

I sent you the following. I attached a zip file in my original message, but I will exclude that in this message - so hopefully it goes through.

MESSAGE:

Hello,

unfortunately the change we made last Wednesday in the remote session is causing troubles now.


  1.  Since then, we are not receiving ANY Content Aware Reports. I tried it myself to upload a file a few minutes ago and no log is visible on the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DAD1EB.48256160]



  1.  Since then, we are not receiving any Log Entries other than ""Policies Received"". Neither ""User Login"", nor ""USB conncted"", nor ""User logout"" ... nothing. I also tried it a few minutes ago(Login and plugin a USB stick) and no logs appear.
[cid:image005.png@01DAD1EB.48256160]


Since then, we are not receiving ANY File Tracing reports either:
[cid:image006.png@01DAD1EB.48256160]

I am not sure if anything else is not working anymore. Please assist as soon as possible because Logs are essential in our current enrollment phase.

PS: As mentioned, I turned on my testclient, I logged in, tried to upload something with remediaten and plugged in a USB stick and NO logs appear on the EPP server - if you want to see these client logs, I attached them.


Thank you very much!

Hello,

 

I sent you the following. I attached a zip file in my original message, but I will exclude that in this message – so hopefully it goes through.

 

MESSAGE:

 

Hello,

 

unfortunately the change we made last Wednesday in the remote session is causing troubles now.

 


	Since then, we are not receiving ANY Content Aware Reports. I tried it myself to upload a file a few minutes ago and no log is visible on the server: 




 

 


	Since then, we are not receiving any Log Entries other than “Policies Received”. Neither “User Login”, nor “USB conncted”, nor “User logout” … nothing. I also tried it a few minutes ago(Login and plugin a USB stick) and no logs appear. 




 

 

Since then, we are not receiving ANY File Tracing reports either:



 

I am not sure if anything else is not working anymore. Please assist as soon as possible because Logs are essential in our current enrollment phase.

 

PS: As mentioned, I turned on my testclient, I logged in, tried to upload something with remediaten and plugged in a USB stick and NO logs appear on the EPP server – if you want to see these client logs, I attached them.

 

 

Thank you very much!

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen
