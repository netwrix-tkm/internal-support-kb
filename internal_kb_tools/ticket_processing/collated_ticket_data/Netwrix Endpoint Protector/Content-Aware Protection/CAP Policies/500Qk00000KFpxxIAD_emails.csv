In the last remote session that we had on the 14th February the customer was not able to reproduce the issue in our remote session, at the end of our call we enabled append logs in case the issue reproduced again with the test build.  In our call I asked the customer to send us the append log file, the artifact, the screenshot as well as the date and time that the incident occurred so that we can know where to look in the log files.  Since then we have not had any update from the customer's side and this is why I sent the below follow up email on the 6th March. 

Please let us know the status of this case from the customer's side.
