I do not have an update for this issue right now, but I will check internally and I will let you know tomorrow if the request for allowing specific domains on github is going to be addressed.

This feature request was not yet addressed, as there are some limitations when it comes to controlling github using the DPI.
I asked internally if this request is on the roadmap and when it will be addressed, if it can be addressed in the near future.

Best regards,
Emil
