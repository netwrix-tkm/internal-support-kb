@WaitingOnEngineer
Hello,
It seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.
There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect.
Most probably it's GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.
We can make a build disabling this strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 agents might not be scanned by EPP.
