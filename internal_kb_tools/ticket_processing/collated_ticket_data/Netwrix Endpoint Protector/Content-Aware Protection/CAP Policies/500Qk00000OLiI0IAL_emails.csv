Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hi, sorry but I didn’t quite understand this part: ""what is displayed after you right click on the EPP client icon -> About Netwrix Endpoint Protector?"" I’ve already tried right-clicking the icon on the upper left pane of the screen, but nothing popped up. Could you please clarify or share a screenshot showing where exactly I should right-click? Thank you!

Hi, just to confirm—based on my understanding, the first limitation with Endpoint Protector is that if we block browsers, users won’t be able to open PDF files in the browser. They’ll need to use a specific app like Adobe Acrobat to open them.
The second limitation is that Endpoint Protector can’t block file transfers when using the new Outlook.
Is that correct? I’ll install the client and let you know after testing. Thank you!

Thank you for your time in today's session!

In the meeting, we have performed the following steps: updating the server to the latest version, upgrading the client to the latest version, but also providing you with a test build for the client to see how it works with the new Outlook.

Regarding the PDF files that are opened in browser, yes, we recommend using the dedicated applications as the event is seen as an upload and will be blocked.

Please let us if the file upload is blocked properly (for the new Outlook) after you install the test built.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Oana, I’ve already installed the client and rebooted my computer. Then I tested sending a file via Outlook, and it worked!
Just to confirm, this client version hasn’t been fully deployed yet, right? In order to use this feature on Outlook, I need to wait for the version to be deployed, right?

Hi Oana, I’ve already installed the client and rebooted my computer. Then I tested sending a file via Outlook, and it worked!
Just to confirm, this client version hasn’t been fully deployed yet, right? In order to use this feature on Outlook, I need to wait for the version to be deployed, right?

Hello,

Thank you for your time in today's session!

In the meeting, we have performed the following steps: updating the server to the latest version, upgrading the client to the latest version, but also providing you with a test build for the client to see how it works with the new Outlook.

Regarding the PDF files that are opened in browser, yes, we recommend using the dedicated applications as the event is seen as an upload and will be blocked.

Please let us if the file upload is blocked properly (for the new Outlook) after you install the test built.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi, just to confirm—based on my understanding, the first limitation with Endpoint Protector is that if we block browsers, users won’t be able to open PDF files in the browser. They’ll need to use a specific app like Adobe Acrobat to open them.
The second limitation is that Endpoint Protector can’t block file transfers when using the new Outlook.
Is that correct? I’ll install the client and let you know after testing. Thank you!

Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hi, sorry but I didn’t quite understand this part: ""what is displayed after you right click on the EPP client icon -> About Netwrix Endpoint Protector?"" I’ve already tried right-clicking the icon on the upper left pane of the screen, but nothing popped up. Could you please clarify or share a screenshot showing where exactly I should right-click? Thank you!

Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hi, sorry but I didn’t quite understand this part: ""what is displayed after you right click on the EPP client icon -> About Netwrix Endpoint Protector?"" I’ve already tried right-clicking the icon on the upper left pane of the screen, but nothing popped up. Could you please clarify or share a screenshot showing where exactly I should right-click? Thank you!

Hello,

Since it is just a test build, we always recommend to use it for testing purposes only and not to install it on multiple computers.

We are aiming to include this fix in one of our future releases.

We will keep you informed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Oana, I’ve already installed the client and rebooted my computer. Then I tested sending a file via Outlook, and it worked!

Just to confirm, this client version hasn’t been fully deployed yet, right? In order to use this feature on Outlook, I need to wait for the version to be deployed, right?

Hello,

Thank you for your time in today's session!

In the meeting, we have performed the following steps: updating the server to the latest version, upgrading the client to the latest version, but also providing you with a test build for the client to see how it works with the new Outlook.

Regarding the PDF files that are opened in browser, yes, we recommend using the dedicated applications as the event is seen as an upload and will be blocked.

Please let us if the file upload is blocked properly (for the new Outlook) after you install the test built.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi, just to confirm—based on my understanding, the first limitation with Endpoint Protector is that if we block browsers, users won’t be able to open PDF files in the browser. They’ll need to use a specific app like Adobe Acrobat to open them.

The second limitation is that Endpoint Protector can’t block file transfers when using the new Outlook.

Is that correct? I’ll install the client and let you know after testing. Thank you!

Hi Oana, just to let you know, I tested once again on Outlook. Suddenly, it doesn't work anymore. I'm not sure why and I didn't change any configurations.

Hello,

Since it is just a test build, we always recommend to use it for testing purposes only and not to install it on multiple computers.

We are aiming to include this fix in one of our future releases.

We will keep you informed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Oana, I’ve already installed the client and rebooted my computer. Then I tested sending a file via Outlook, and it worked!
Just to confirm, this client version hasn’t been fully deployed yet, right? In order to use this feature on Outlook, I need to wait for the version to be deployed, right?

Hello,

Thank you for your time in today's session!

In the meeting, we have performed the following steps: updating the server to the latest version, upgrading the client to the latest version, but also providing you with a test build for the client to see how it works with the new Outlook.

Regarding the PDF files that are opened in browser, yes, we recommend using the dedicated applications as the event is seen as an upload and will be blocked.

Please let us if the file upload is blocked properly (for the new Outlook) after you install the test built.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi, just to confirm—based on my understanding, the first limitation with Endpoint Protector is that if we block browsers, users won’t be able to open PDF files in the browser. They’ll need to use a specific app like Adobe Acrobat to open them.
The second limitation is that Endpoint Protector can’t block file transfers when using the new Outlook.
Is that correct? I’ll install the client and let you know after testing. Thank you!

Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hello,
Monday at 3:00 PM MYT works for me.
FYI, the issue we’re facing includes the following:

  1.
PDF files containing sensitive data should not be accessible via any browser, but currently they can be opened. However, they are still being blocked when attempting to upload the sensitive file.
  2.
When attempting to upload the file to Outlook, it is initially blocked, but after a few hours, it no longer gets blocked.

Looking forward to speaking with you on Monday.

Best Regards,

Muhammad Aisy Nazran

Hi Oana, just to let you know, I tested once again on Outlook. Suddenly, it doesn't work anymore. I'm not sure why and I didn't change any configurations.

Hello,

Since it is just a test build, we always recommend to use it for testing purposes only and not to install it on multiple computers.

We are aiming to include this fix in one of our future releases.

We will keep you informed.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Oana, I’ve already installed the client and rebooted my computer. Then I tested sending a file via Outlook, and it worked!
Just to confirm, this client version hasn’t been fully deployed yet, right? In order to use this feature on Outlook, I need to wait for the version to be deployed, right?

Hello,

Thank you for your time in today's session!

In the meeting, we have performed the following steps: updating the server to the latest version, upgrading the client to the latest version, but also providing you with a test build for the client to see how it works with the new Outlook.

Regarding the PDF files that are opened in browser, yes, we recommend using the dedicated applications as the event is seen as an upload and will be blocked.

Please let us if the file upload is blocked properly (for the new Outlook) after you install the test built.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi, just to confirm—based on my understanding, the first limitation with Endpoint Protector is that if we block browsers, users won’t be able to open PDF files in the browser. They’ll need to use a specific app like Adobe Acrobat to open them.
The second limitation is that Endpoint Protector can’t block file transfers when using the new Outlook.
Is that correct? I’ll install the client and let you know after testing. Thank you!

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000OLiI0:ref

Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

I’ve already tried right-clicking the icon on the upper left pane of the screen, but nothing popped up. Could you please clarify or share a screenshot showing where exactly I should right-click?

Hello,

Monday at 3:00 PM MYT works for me.

FYI, the issue we’re facing includes the following:


	
	PDF files containing sensitive data should not be accessible via any browser, but currently they can be opened. However, they are still being blocked when attempting to upload the sensitive file.
	
	
	When attempting to upload the file to Outlook, it is initially blocked, but after a few hours, it no longer gets blocked.

Hi, mind if I ask another question ? usually, when people open PDF files, it gets redirected to the browser, right? But when I enable browsers under the policy exit points, it ends up blocking the user from even opening the file. Is there a way to create a rule that excludes this behavior—so users can open PDF files in the browser, but the rule still blocks them from uploading the file to any website?

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hi, sorry but I didn’t quite understand this part: ""what is displayed after you right click on the EPP client icon -> About Netwrix Endpoint Protector?"" I’ve already tried right-clicking the icon on the upper left pane of the screen, but nothing popped up. Could you please clarify or share a screenshot showing where exactly I should right-click? Thank you!

So far I already tested on Windows only. The current server is Ubuntu Linux and the client version is 5.9.4.0.

Hello,

Thank you reaching out!

Is this issue happening on all the computers (Windows/macOS/Linux)? 
Also, what is the current server and client version?

Looking forward to your reply.
