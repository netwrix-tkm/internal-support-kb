Please note we are facing an issue at Dubai Customs running EPP : 95.9.3.0 with latest Hotfix #1.1. The client machine is able to block notepad with custom keywork but for word if shows DPI ByPassed Traffic, WebScoket Passthrough. I am attaching the event log screenshot to this ticket.

If I uncheck Bypass Websockets in DPI even, then it is allowed and does not show any event.

Thanks and Regards,
Fawad","","","","Cases resolved by making changes to Allowlists file type.
