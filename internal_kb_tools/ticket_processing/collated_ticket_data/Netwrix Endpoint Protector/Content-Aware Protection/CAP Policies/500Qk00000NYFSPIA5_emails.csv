Hi Alin,

The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.

When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.

Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.

Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.

Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin,

The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.

When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.

Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.

Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.

Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin,



The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.



When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.



Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.



Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.



Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin,



The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.



When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.



Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.



Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.



Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.



When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.



Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.



Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.



Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin,



The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.



When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.



Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.



Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.



Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin,



The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well.



When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine.



Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible.



Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently.



Looking forward for your availability.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As you mentioned, ""Configured duplicate policy. After that file upload is blocked as per the duplicate policy. But the original policy is not blocking the file uploading."", can you please then use the duplicated policy instead?
From what you are describing, it seems that something did not save right at that moment for the first policy.

Hi Alin, 
 

 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well. 
 

 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine. 
 

 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible. 
 

 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently. 
 

 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
Looking forward for your availability.

Hi Alin, 

  

The issue is persistent with the duplicate policy as well. 

  

When I have created the new test policy. It was working fine. 

  

Please assist us to resolve the reported issue with the existing policy configuration at the earliest possible. 

  

Please note that this is CoSoSys implementation. Need to resolve this issue urgently. 

  

Looking forward for your availability.

Sure, to recap what we've done today:

1.For the MS Forms issue, we adjusted the DPI allowlist and add it to the CAP policy to exclude the MS Form portal from being scanned when uploading documents.

2. For ManageEngine issue, Vinay already had a DPI allowlist in place, only thing to do was to have it added to the CAP policy to be excluded and as a result, it was working accordingl with both remote sessions issue and ticketing update problem.

3. For OneDrive, other than enabling the DPI, nothing else was done as the other settings were properly adjusted to allow accessing the files.

For the issue with the USB Device access we will check tomorrow at the specified timeframe.

Thank you for your patience!

Hi Marian,

 

We have observed below issues w.r.t CAP policy:

 


	Data uploading on MS Office form is getting blocked even though we have whitelisted the URL.
	When DPI is enabled, team is not able to take remote of the device from their ticketing tool(manage engine).
	Some of the devices are showing offline even though it is connected to internet.


 

Request you to please schedule a call with us to troubleshoot the issues

 


Feel free to reach out again.

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

To recap what we've done today:

We allowed the yealink wireless presentation pods  to be excluded from the device control by creating an exception rule for them.

We first tested on your 0051 machine and once we saw that it is working we added the rule to the global settings and tested on Ramesh's side and he confirmed it's working as well.

The current ticket will be marked as closed but if you have further issues/requests, do not hesitate to contact us.

Have a great day!

	Some of the devices are showing offline even though it is connected to internet.


 

Request you to please schedule a call with us to troubleshoot the issues
