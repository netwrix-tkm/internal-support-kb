Not sure if that is possible so opening another as well. We have added all the internal domains in the allowlist but seems the allowlist is not working. Is there any limit to number of domains can be added. We have 100+ internal domains and the allowlist is considering the target as 25 . I tried to create multiple allow list but still it is not working and the emails are getting blocked.","1. Setup CAP policy with allowlist to 100+ internal domains.
2. Send an email with attachment to an internal domain.
3. Email is blocked due to attachment.","The email was blocked because the Epp client sees the internal emails being sent to Exchange Server.","","We added Exchange Server to the email whitelist.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","8.1","Closed - Resolved","ING companies","Sudipa Bera","2024-10-17T11:19:13.000Z","2024-10-25T13:52:25.000Z"
