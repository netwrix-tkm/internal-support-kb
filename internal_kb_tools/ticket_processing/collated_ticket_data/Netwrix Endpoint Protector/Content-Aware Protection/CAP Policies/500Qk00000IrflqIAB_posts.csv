The CAP policy created to block uploads on Github is not working as desired, we expect your support at the earliest as this is priority.

Schedule a call tomorrow asap 09:00 AM onwards (GST timezone).

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-27T17:55:12.000Z"

Since September, they have had 25 tickets 6 open escalation tickets and 6 open support tickets remain. The highest priority for the customer is the GitHub ticket <a href=""https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000IrflqIAB/view"" alt=""https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000IrflqIAB/view"" target=""_blank"">00428361</a>/<a href=""https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Jy1RMIAZ/view"" alt=""https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Qk00000Jy1RMIAZ/view"" target=""_blank"">00430839</a> the escalation ticket is only 6 days old but the support ticket is over 30. Again, I know this was just submitted between Christmas and NYE but if we can get a status on when this will be resourced for review, I&#39;d appreciate it. It&#39;s priority is Critical. </p><p> </p><p>I created a Mgmt Esc for this and provided the above to Cristi H (EPP scrum) for review.</p><p>More to follow.</p>","","","","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2025-01-02T17:09:28.000Z"

Can we ask you to uninstall the existing EPP client and then retest the scenario with the test build ( EPP client version 6.2.4.0053) on one of the affected machines.  First you will need to uninstall the existing EPP Client version making sure that you also check the option ""Remove database and logs"". Restart the system, then install version v6.2.4.0053.","","","","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2025-01-14T13:34:04.000Z"
