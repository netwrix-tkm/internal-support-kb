@WaitingOnEngineer
Please open the log file and search for ""Scan File:"".
The result will be 331354 results (these means the agent scan 300k files), this causes the Time Mahcine failure and also can causes performance problems.

Our recomandation related to time machine is:

	 - 	use whitelist/allowlist of file location to not scan the time machine files

Recomandation is to add the following file paths:

	 - 	/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/
	 - 	/Volumes/Backups of */*
	 - 	/Volumes/Backup */*.previous/*
	 - 	/Volumes/Backup */*.inprogress/*

(this method can causes also performance problem because every file is checked to see if the scanned file is maching one of the whitelisted file)

     2. use for a specific device with right ""allow access and exclude from CAP scanning"" -> this will allow to not scan any file transfered on this device
