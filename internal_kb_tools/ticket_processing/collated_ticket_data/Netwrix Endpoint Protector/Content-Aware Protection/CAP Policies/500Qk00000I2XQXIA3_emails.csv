The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Thank you for the update.  I see that the domains / URL destination details shows now after you have enabled Deep Packet Inspection.

For the details listed under the ""Destination"" tab, these are the applications that were used as an exit point when the reported data / files were transmitted.  For example you will see that the names under this tab corresponds to the names of the apps selected under ""Policy Exit Points"" in the Content Aware Policy.



I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

The “DPI Restricted Apps” policy is a default policy that Endpoint Protector uses to enforce DPI Denylists.  When a user attempts to access a URL or domain which was added to the DPI Denylist then the name “DPI Restricted Apps” policy will show.

Hi Vaneet,

Thank you for the update.  I see that the domains / URL destination details shows now after you have enabled Deep Packet Inspection.

For the details listed under the ""Destination"" tab, these are the applications that were used as an exit point when the reported data / files were transmitted.  For example you will see that the names under this tab corresponds to the names of the apps selected under ""Policy Exit Points"" in the Content Aware Policy.



I hope this information helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

 

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

 

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

I have enabled the DPI and “Reporting V2” is already enabled.

 

Configuration Snap FYI:



 

 



 

 

Just wanted to know what are these destinations which comes under Social Media/ others category.

Example: ADB, CURL, Edge, RSYNC, SCP, Transmission, Ultra

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""



Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

 

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

 

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

I have enabled the DPI and “Reporting V2” is already enabled.

 

Configuration Snap FYI:



 

 



 

 

Just wanted to know what are these destinations which comes under Social Media/ others category.

Example: ADB, CURL, Edge, RSYNC, SCP, Transmission, Ultra

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi André,

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi André,

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""



Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

 

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

 

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

I have enabled the DPI and “Reporting V2” is already enabled.

 

Configuration Snap FYI:



 

 



 

 

Just wanted to know what are these destinations which comes under Social Media/ others category.

Example: ADB, CURL, Edge, RSYNC, SCP, Transmission, Ultra

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

I would like to give you an update on this case.  See below the feedback that we received from our R&D team

There seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.  There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect.  We suspect that the conflict is with GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.  We can build a client that will disable the strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 applications might not be scanned by EPP.

Would you like us to proceed to create with this build of EPP client ?


Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.



Kind regards

Hi André,

 

After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.

 

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

I have enabled the DPI and “Reporting V2” is already enabled.

 

Configuration Snap FYI:



 

 



 

 

Just wanted to know what are these destinations which comes under Social Media/ others category.

Example: ADB, CURL, Edge, RSYNC, SCP, Transmission, Ultra

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi André,

Thanks for the update,

We would prefer to continue with the existing EPP build, because as you mentioned, with the new build some traffic which comes through CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect might not be scanned by EPP.

And, Our priority is to ensure complete traffic monitoring without any risk of traffic bypass.

Hi Vaneet,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  See below the feedback that we received from our R&D team

There seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.  There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect.  We suspect that the conflict is with GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.  We can build a client that will disable the strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 applications might not be scanned by EPP.

Would you like us to proceed to create with this build of EPP client ?


Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Kindly resolve this on priority.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

We would prefer to continue with the existing EPP build, because as you mentioned, with the new build some traffic which comes through CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect might not be scanned by EPP.

 

And, Our priority is to ensure complete traffic monitoring without any risk of traffic bypass.

 


Regards,

Vaneet Kumar

Hi Vaneet,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  See below the feedback that we received from our R&D team

There seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.  There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and  PaloAlto GlobalProtect.  We suspect that the conflict is with  GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.  We can build a client that will disable the strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 applications might not be scanned by EPP.

Would you like us to proceed to create with this build of EPP client ?


Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""



Kind regards

Hi André,

I just wanted to follow up regarding the two issues we've been encountering:

  1.
After enabling DPI, some VPN (GlobalProtect) users experienced random URL blocking.
  2.
Content Threat Blocked under DPI Restricted Apps, even though no URLs are explicitly added to the Denylist.

I think the feedback you received from the R&D team is for issue no.1 only.
Could you provide any updates on the second issue?

Regards,
Vaneet Kumar

Hi André,



Thanks for the update,



We would prefer to continue with the existing EPP build, because as you mentioned, with the new build some traffic which comes through CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect might not be scanned by EPP.



And, Our priority is to ensure complete traffic monitoring without any risk of traffic bypass.

Vaneet Kumar

Hi Vaneet,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  See below the feedback that we received from our R&D team

There seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.  There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect.  We suspect that the conflict is with GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.  We can build a client that will disable the strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 applications might not be scanned by EPP.

Would you like us to proceed to create with this build of EPP client ?


Kind regards

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,



After enabling the DPI, users are getting block pages on internal URLs.



Kindly resolve this on priority.

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""



Kind regards

Thank you for your email and update.

Can I ask you to have a look at DPI configurations and send us a screenshot of the current settings please? You will find it under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"" > ""DPI Configuration"" or you can check under ""Computers"" for computer level.

If  ""DPI Bypass"" is currently turned off, can you switch this setting on, save the settings, update the policies on the affected endpoint computers then test to see if the issue still persists please?




Please let us know the result of the above.

Hi André,

 

I just wanted to follow up regarding the two issues we've been encountering:


	
	After enabling DPI, some VPN (GlobalProtect) users experienced random URL blocking.
	
	
	Content Threat Blocked under DPI Restricted Apps, even though no URLs are explicitly added to the Denylist.
	


I think the feedback you received from the R&D team is for issue no.1 only.

Could you provide any updates on the second issue?

Vaneet Kumar

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

We would prefer to continue with the existing EPP build, because as you mentioned, with the new build some traffic which comes through CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and PaloAlto GlobalProtect might not be scanned by EPP.

 

And, Our priority is to ensure complete traffic monitoring without any risk of traffic bypass.

Vaneet Kumar

Hi Vaneet,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  See below the feedback that we received from our R&D team

There seems to be an interaction with another agent installed on the system.  There are 2 agents: CrowdStrike Falcon sensor and  PaloAlto GlobalProtect.  We suspect that the conflict is with  GlobalProtect, it also has some firewall rules that redirect traffic.  We can build a client that will disable the strict check that we have, but that means that some traffic that comes through some of these 2 applications might not be scanned by EPP.

Would you like us to proceed to create with this build of EPP client ?

Hi Vaneet,

If you do not want to have internal domains restricted then you will need to remove them from the DPI denylists under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > ""Denylists"" > ""Domain and URL"", select the relevant dictionary and edit it to remove the internal domains.  Click on save and then update the policies on the endpoint machines.  As an example please see the short video recording attached ""How to remove URL and Domains from DPI Denylits.mkv"" that demonstrates how to do this.

Hi André,

 

Thanks for the update,

 

I have enabled the DPI and “Reporting V2” is already enabled.

 

Configuration Snap FYI:



 

 



 

 

Just wanted to know what are these destinations which comes under Social Media/ others category.

Example: ADB, CURL, Edge, RSYNC, SCP, Transmission, Ultra

Hi Vaneet,

The destination details is a seperate column.  You will need to click on the ""Show/Hide Columns"" and then select ""Destination Details"".  Please also note that this column will only be visible if you have ""Reporting V2"" enabled under ""System Configuration"" > ""System Settings"".


You will also need to have ""Deep Packet Inspection"" enabled if you would like the URLs or Domains to be reported.  Deep Packet Inspection can be enabled under ""Device Control"" > ""Global Settings"".

I have made a short video recording showing how to enable Report V2 and how to select the ""Destination Details"" column and where you will see the destination URLs.  Please see the attached video recording ""Enable Report V2 and Destination Details.mkv""



Kind regards
