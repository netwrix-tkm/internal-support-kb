Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we upgraded the EPP client on your end and made some adjustments. We also enabled Silent mode so pop-ups no longer appear.

We strongly recommend upgrading the EPP clients for the other users as well and then setting the EPP client Mode to Silent mode and see if they still experience the issues with the notifications.

We are closing this ticket.
