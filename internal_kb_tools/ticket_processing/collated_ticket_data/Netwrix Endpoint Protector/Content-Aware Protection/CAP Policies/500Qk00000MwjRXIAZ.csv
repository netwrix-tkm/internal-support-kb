"500Qk00000MwjRXIAZ","00438873","Support Ticket","Need assistance setting up a Content Aware Policy","We are attempting to setup a content aware policy and have setup a test policy for credit card information for reporting and it appears to be flagging just about everything on the test computer. Could I get some assistance to see what I may be doing wrong?","","","","We identified the issue for the large amount of logs containing files that did not contain PII information, it was the fact that file types(Office and text) were also selected. This causes that all files of those file types to be reported and/or blocked from being uploaded, no matter if they contain PII or not. If you remove the file types and only leave the PII information selected then it will pick-up every file containing PII no matter the file type it is in.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","16.8","Closed - Resolved","Atris Technology, LLC","Mark Bernard","2025-03-14T19:05:54.000Z","2025-03-31T13:42:39.000Z"
