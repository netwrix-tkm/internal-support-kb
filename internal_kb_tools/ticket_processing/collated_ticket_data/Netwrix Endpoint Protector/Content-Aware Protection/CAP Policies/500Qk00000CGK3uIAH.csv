I created a content-aware policy to monitor all file types, but I noticed that the policy is also capturing downloaded files. I couldn't differentiate between uploaded and downloaded files.

Is there a way to differentiate the uploaded and downloaded files ?","","","","Unfortunately you cannot differentiate between downloaded and uploaded files with DPI disabled. DPI has to be enabled from server UI and the DPI certificate needs to be added on the MacOS Keychain app and marked as Trusted, in order to help with this use case.","","Alin Decean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","9.1","Closed - Resolved","ServiceNow","Arpitha Shetty","2024-06-25T11:21:21.000Z","2024-07-04T13:04:57.000Z"
