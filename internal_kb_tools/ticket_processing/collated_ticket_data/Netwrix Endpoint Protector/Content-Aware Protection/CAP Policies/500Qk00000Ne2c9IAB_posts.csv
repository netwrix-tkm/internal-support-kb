We have encountered the following issue.
There is a CAP policy at the top of the policy list that is configured to block access for predefined and custom content. This policy is explicitly targeted only at a test group consisting of two computers. It works as expected – the test group is affected, and all other users are not.
However, one user who returned to work after a long absence was unexpectedly affected by this block policy. This user had an outdated agent version, and possibly did not have a valid agent license at the time of connection. As soon as the user connected to the network, the block policy was applied to them, even though they are not part of the test group. This is confirmed in the logs.
How can this be explained?
If a user does not belong to any group at all, what policies are applied to them and based on what principle?
It’s important to note that after the agent was updated and the computer was restarted, everything returned to normal.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-03T11:49:28.000Z"

Given that she did not had any logs during the time of occurrence we cannot determine the exact cause of this.

Asked that next time this happens to gather the logs and get back to us to investigate further.
Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-10T12:39:17.000Z"
