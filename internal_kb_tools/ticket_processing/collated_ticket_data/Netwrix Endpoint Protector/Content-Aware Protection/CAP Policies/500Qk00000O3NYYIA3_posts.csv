On the screenshot attatched, do i press generate, and all 3 lists will be generated? Or is it only the latest one I worked on? Also on other screen shot for making contexual lists for credit card, under 'Type', there are options for Amex, Disover etc. Does that mean I have to make a contextual list for every type of credit card we want the list to apply to? Or is selecting 'Amex' enough to cover all credit cards like 'Discover'.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-14T21:20:25.000Z"
