Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

I noticed that the logs which you submitted contains empty ""eppclient.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" files, can we schedule a debug session (video record and logs collection) for tomorrow with you and the end customer ?

But they collected another set of logs, it seems fine now (not empty).

Thank you for getting back to me, I noticed that the customer seems to be collecting the logs from a test build version ""3.0.4.0023"" we need to test and collect the logs from the latest official version ""3.0.4.1006"" and it would also be best to make a video recording where the behavior is demonstrated so that our developers can see.  This would be very helpful.

Would it be possible to have a remote session with the customer and one of the affected users?

Kind regards
