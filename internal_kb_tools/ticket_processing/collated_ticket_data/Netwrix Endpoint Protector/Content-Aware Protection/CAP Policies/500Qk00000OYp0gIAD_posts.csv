I previously made a request to add a Windows app from Mac.
The assigned engineer was Andrei Pop, and I would appreciate it if he could respond to this case as well.

For now, I have added the Windows app to the CAP list.
The server version is 5.9.4.1, and the client version is 3.9.4.1006.

The two attached ZIP files contain logs from the customer’s environment.

1.
When you previously added the Windows app to my test server, it worked well and real-time logs were generated, as shown in the attached ""<a href='https://LOG.png' target='_blank'>LOG.png</a>"".
However, in the customer’s Windows app, there are no logs related to the policy at all.

2.
In my test server as well, once a file is moved or copied using the Windows app's Redirect Folder, no further logs are created for repeated actions.
Just like in ""<a href='https://LOG.png' target='_blank'>LOG.png</a>"", a log appears only the first time, and nothing is logged afterward even if I move the same file again.
I would like to know if this is the intended behavior, or if it's because the Windows app was only temporarily added.

3.
Could you please check why the customer's Windows app is not working properly with the policy?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-29T02:21:33.000Z"
