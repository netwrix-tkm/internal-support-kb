@WaitingOnEngineer the customer is using an old client from 2023 January 11. Since then there were changes regarding sensitive data obfuscation. Indeed, I managed to reproduce the issue with EPP client version 2.0.0.6, but can not reproduce with version 2.4.3.1007. Please ask the customer to check if the problem persist with the latest client version.
