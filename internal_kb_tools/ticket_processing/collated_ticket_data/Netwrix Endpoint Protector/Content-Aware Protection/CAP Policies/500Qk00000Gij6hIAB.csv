We are currently working on an implementation for the customer, Casio Watches. However, we are facing some issues with content and file blocking on the network and FTP shares. Although the Content Aware report indicates that the file is blocked, the file is still being uploaded to the network share.

Please advise on how we can resolve this.","","","","Isuse fixed with 6.2.3.1.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","NONE","","39.0","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Bhavishya Arya","2024-10-07T09:01:14.000Z","2024-11-15T07:56:45.000Z"
