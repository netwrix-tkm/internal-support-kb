Hello!

Thank you for the quick response.
So, I have not found any virtualization platform within the CAP policy exit points.
I was searching for VBox, VMware, Hyper-v and Oracle but nothing is in there.
So does it mean that the only way to control Virtual Platforms is or block the application or just install EPP client on virtual machines?
