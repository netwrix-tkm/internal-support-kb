Hello Dave,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00435197. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00435197
Ticket Subject: Credit card detections when using website
Ticket Details: Hi support,

A user has reported an issue where he receives regular pop up notification saying content has been blocked when he is not attempting to upload any content - just brose the web site.

The alert claims to have blocked a number of credit card number. Not always the same number, but sometimes they are the same.

In the content aware report we see these reported as web-upload (no file name) and the events are not logged against any particular website, just Mozilla.

I'll send a screenshot so you can see.

How can we determine the cause of these please and will it be possible to exception if there is no web site shown in the report?

Thank you,
Dave

Thank you!
