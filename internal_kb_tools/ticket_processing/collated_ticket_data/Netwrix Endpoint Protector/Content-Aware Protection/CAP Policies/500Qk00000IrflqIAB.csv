Thanks!","","Our Dev team have prepared a test build for you.  Can we ask you to uninstall the existing EPP client and then retest the scenario with the test build ( EPP client version 6.2.4.0053) on one of the affected machines.  First you will need to uninstall the existing EPP Client version making sure that you also check the option ""Remove database and logs"". Restart the system, then install version v6.2.4.0053.","TBD based upon customer test results.","Closing ticket as resolved and confirmed by the client.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Policies","","","118.6","Closed - Resolved","Avrioc Technologies","Naveen Kumar","2024-11-27T17:55:10.000Z","2025-03-26T07:31:17.000Z"
