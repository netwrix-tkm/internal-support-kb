Please let me know if the customer has availability for a remote session next week. We would like to take a look over this issue.

There was a fix for this in the EPP server version 5.9.3.0.

Hi team,

unfortunately I have not received any reply from the prospect so far. In our last email she seemed a bit angry about the issues she was facing with the functionalities mentioned below. I have tried to reach out to her several times but I was unable to get an answer. Since she is unresponsive, please close the ticket and I will re-open it when she will reply.

Best regards,
Stefania
