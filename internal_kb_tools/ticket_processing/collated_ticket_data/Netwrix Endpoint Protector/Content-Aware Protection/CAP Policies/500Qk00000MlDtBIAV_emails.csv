1. We are currently monitoring DLP events via printers and the logging of blocked events appears in the Content Aware Report. However, the InfoSec team is interested in seeing all printing logs whether they are blocked or successful. That way they can see the files being printed. Is that possible?
We only log incidents that trigger the policies created, and since this is not the purpose of our solution, it is not possible.

2. For files that are blocked, is there a way to retain a copy of the file that was attempted so the security team can scan then?
Yes, we do have the File Shadow feature that creates a copy of the detected file so you can review it. However, since this is a very highly resource-using feature, it is not recommended to have it enabled globally. Its purpose is to audit certain suspicious users/computers, and enabling it at a global level will increase the overall number of processes so it might bring the appliance to a crawl. Another result of this feature is an increase in disk space usage.

Let me know if you have follow-up questions or if this ticket can be closed.

Theoretically, yes. If you create a RegEx looking for a space you could achieve this if set as restricted content, but I would strongly advise against it as it will give a lot of results.
This will also cause more processes to run on the server so you will see slowness and disk space usage increase.
