Please check to see if the Computer Settings are the same for both devices. It's possible that your device has Custom Settings, while the test device is on Global Settings, or vice versa.

You can verify this by navigating to Device Control -> Computers, and searching for the mentioned computers.

Thank you!

Please ensure you are checking the Settings, not the Rights.

If you need to restore from Custom to Global Settings, right-click on the target computer, select Manage Settings, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on Restore Global Settings.

Under Device Control < Computers

For the 2 working devices - Settings = Inherited

For device not working right - Settings = Custom

 

Is that why? How do I change its settings to Inherited?

Hi Ismail,

Please check to see if the Computer Settings are the same for both devices. It's possible that your device has Custom Settings, while the test device is on Global Settings, or vice versa.

You can verify this by navigating to Device Control -> Computers, and searching for the mentioned computers.

Thank you!

no, the 2 macbooks working properly are on macOS 12, the one that is not working is on macOS 13. DPI should be configured the same because they are on the same CAP right? how could i verify that

Hi Ismail,

Thank you for reaching out.

Could you please confirm if the test machine is running the same operating system as yours? Additionally, are the DPI settings configured the same way?
