Customer added a new video where he tested the scenario with the Gmail – Sometimes  the uploads  blocked (no notification popup after few upload attempts ), and after some time, they are allowed completely.

Also, can you please let us know why there are not pop ups for any threat that has been detected.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-10-25T13:12:00.000Z","2024-10-25T13:12:00.000Z","false","false"

I don't have a final conclusion yet on this one, but it seems to me that the issue here is related to the some incorrect settings/policies. First of all, does the customer actually need URL categories? They are only interested in monitoring certain destinations? Did you try without URL categories enabled? I see a long video form the 25th of October, but the logs are from 18th of October. I wanted to say first that the settings from the video do not match with what I see in the logs. But only after that I realized that the video and the logs are from different dates. Related to the second issue reported, with gmail and missing notifications, without logs, there is nothing that we can do/say. Maybe it is related to the caches we have, but as I said, without logs, we can only make assumptions. 

Getting back to the initial issue reported and the logs. In the logs, there is only one URL category applied to the PC. And the destination is: ""https://www.virustotal.com"". I don't recommend customers to add destinations like this. That is because the actual destination when a file is uploaded will not look like that. I tested on my machine and files uploaded to virustotal.com get to ""'bigfiles.virustotal.com"" (at least this happens in my case). And I uploaded a simple txt file. So, best would be if the customers add some like: ""virustotal.com"". 

Get another remote session, gather logs and record it as well and test how I proposed. But please, keep in mind the initial questions I asked, maybe they don't really need URL categories. If they do and you you want to be sure what the destination is, try the initial tests without URL categories enabled. In this case, the EPP client should theoretically block the transfers and display in CAP reports the destination as well. After that, you can use that destination (or an adapted version of it) to add the URL categories.
