Thank you so much for the support.

 

Just one question regarding the google domain allowlist.

Due to this is a global setting, is it possible to block all google domains by default, but grant a few users permission, with exception list,  temp password or some other ways?

 

Another question regarding DPI monitored URL. We expected data transfer to all URL to be checked and only transfer to the defined URLs in allow list will not be blocked.

Should we select any categories here?


 

 

Best regards,

Hongbin Yu
