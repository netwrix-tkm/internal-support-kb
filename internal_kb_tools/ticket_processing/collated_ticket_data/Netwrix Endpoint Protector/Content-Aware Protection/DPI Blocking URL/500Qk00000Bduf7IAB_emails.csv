Thank you for reaching out to us.
Can you please check if the user is able to access the URLs if the Stealthy DPI driver is enabled for him?
Also can you check if his computer or user name is not selected in any other policy that may have that URL selected in the Denylist?
Are you using any outside network policies?

Hi Alin,

We have checked and found that the computer is still bound to the CAP policy (with Report Only action). After removing the computer from the policy, it was able to access the sites listed in the Domain & URL denylist again.

Could you help to explain the following items?
- Even though the action on the priority policy is ""Report Only"" and the computer is also excluded from the entities in the policy with the ""Block & Report"" action, why does access to the sites listed in the Domain & URL denylist remain blocked? Shouldn't it only report the action while allowing the computer to access the sites?
- The logs in the Content Aware report do not refer to the CAP policy that captures the action (access to the sites) but rather to the DPI Domain Denylist, as shown in the attached screenshot (Content Aware Report.png). Shouldn't the logs refer to the CAP Policy with the report action?
For your reference, I have recorded my attempts to reproduce the action and attached it to this ticket..

Thank you.

Thank you for your reply.
Regarding the two points that you mentioned, I inquired internally and I'll respond below:
The DPI Denylist is acting as a global stand-alone policy, that is why it doesn't take in consideration if it's Report only or Block and report. For the same reason the policy that comes up as triggered in the CAP Reports is DPI Domain Denylist.

Hi Alin, 

Thanks for your confirmation. 
Could you help us with documentation references for DPI?
We need it to explain to the customer since they have an antivirus solution that performs SSL inspection on the endpoints, which we believe is interfering with the DPI operation on their endpoints.

Thank you,
