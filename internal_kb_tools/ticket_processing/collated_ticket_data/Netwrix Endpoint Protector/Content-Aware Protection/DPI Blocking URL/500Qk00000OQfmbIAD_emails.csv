My name is Ramon from Netwrix Technical Support, and I've been assigned to your case. I'm currently exploring whether it's possible to block uploads from personal Microsoft Teams while allowing uploads from business Microsoft Teams using Endpoint Protector.

Could you please share your availability for a remote session next week, if needed? Kindly include the days, times, and your time zone.

Thank you.

Hello Ramon,

Just to clarify, there's no way to blocking selectively to MS Teams account. What if we setup DPI URL blocking to MS OneDrive, will the file still be saved to user's OneDrive when they share the files through MS Teams?

Thank you for asking this question. I am currently testing to see if it is possible to setup DPI URL blocking to MS OneDrive, to see if the file still will be saved to user’s OneDrive when they share the files through MS Teams. I will let you know once I have finish testing to see if this is possible. 

Thank you.
