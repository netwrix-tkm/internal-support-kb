Hello Emil,

Please setup a session for 16:30.

Also, could you maybe setup a 1hr session as I would like to discuss something worrying that I have discovered today? I was able to cause the deactivation of the server connection and EPP did not apply any policies anymore. This was caused by multiple reconnections to the Palo Alto VPN. I will do some more testing in the morning and raise a case with all the details for you.

Thank you,

Hello Andrei,

Would 17:00 work for you? I have a conflicting meeting at 16:00.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,

 

Please setup a session for 16:30. 

 

Also, could you maybe setup a 1hr session as I would like to discuss something worrying that I have discovered today? I was able to cause the deactivation of the server connection and EPP did not apply any policies anymore. This was caused by multiple reconnections to the Palo Alto VPN. I will do some more testing in the morning and raise a case with all the details for you.

 

Thank you,

Hello Andrei,

Would 17:00 work for you? I have a conflicting meeting at 16:00.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,

 

Please setup a session for 16:30. 

 

Also, could you maybe setup a 1hr session as I would like to discuss something worrying that I have discovered today? I was able to cause the deactivation of the server connection and EPP did not apply any policies anymore. This was caused by multiple reconnections to the Palo Alto VPN. I will do some more testing in the morning and raise a case with all the details for you.

 

Thank you,

Hello Alin,

We had a support session with an affected user, where we installed the test build, but this has proven to be unsuccessful.

The iOS simulator was still unable to access any websites. But, when we re-installed the regular agent (3.0.2.2), the issue did not happened anymore.

In order to confirm the issue, before installing the test build we took down DPI to confirm the access was working without DPI. Once turned back on, the access stopped working.

As for the moment, the user is able to access the websites on the regular agent version, this case can be closed. If there will be any future issues, I will raise a new one.

Thank you,
