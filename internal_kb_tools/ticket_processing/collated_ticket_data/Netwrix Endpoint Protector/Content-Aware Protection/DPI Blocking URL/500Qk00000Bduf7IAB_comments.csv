@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan I think this should be handled by the Product team, we have some standard information that we provide to the customers in this case. Briefly the EPP client performs MITM in order to inspect the network traffic and yes, it might happen that some antivirus software detects this and there might be some incompatibilities between EPP and that AV (I know about a recent case with EPP and ESET, and issues when SSL filtering is enabled in ESET)

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hi Support team,

As we clearly state tin UM (https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/ContentAwareProtection/Module.htm) that we don't recommend to overlap with other third party SSL inspection tools, customer need to decide which solution will be used to validate website certs.


--- CODE ---
Note on Peer Certiﬁcate Validation Usage

If Deep Packet Inspection is ON and Peer Certiﬁcate Validation is enabled then you cannot access unsecured websites and a certiﬁcate warning message is displayed.
If Deep Packet Inspection is ON and Peer Certiﬁcate Validation is disabled then you can access unsecured websites and no certiﬁcate warning messages are displayed.
For Example; your organization uses an SSL inspection proxy or gateway. The certiﬁcates injected by the proxy or gateway cannot be validated on the endpoint because they are either invalid or the issuer CA certiﬁcate is not installed in the ""Trusted Root Certiﬁcation Authorities"" in the computer certiﬁcate store. To allow Deep Packet Inspection to work in this case you must skip peer certiﬁcates validation. Endpoint Protector Client assumes that in this case the peer certiﬁcate validation is performed by the proxy or gateway so that security is not compromised.

In top of that following Markus & my e-mail from Tue, Oct 31, 2023 ""[Documentation] New Security Application Guide AVAILABLE"" we recommend to implement 3rd party security exclusion for EPP (AV/EDR/CASB) -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRuvV7tGr5hVvkUkg9EdK6382tk2fsYu/view 

fyi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan
