We do not know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.
Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hi Alin,

I hope you are well.

There is a spike set to be investigated in 5.9.6.0 that would handle Chatgpt.
This was supposed to be addressed sooner, however, due to other priorities, the work on this has been postponed.

Regards,
Cristi

@WaitingOnEngineer I tested with 5.9.4.1 and the historic incompatibility with DPI and Open AI's ChatGPT is no more.

This is a different issue that should be treated separately from the ChatGPT spike.

As a workaround, until we provide a fix, the customer can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes) that is causing them the blocks and false positive logs.

We think that we can't reproduce this in our environment because we don't get the Cloudflare challenge when accessing the chatgpt.com website. That challenge will usually appear for blacklisted or suspect IP addresses.

I noticed that our customer is using a web-proxy in their LAN, however I also tested with a LAN proxy and still can't make the Cloudflare challenge appear.

A workaround for our customer while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass theÂ  Cloudflare challenge in their web browser. After that they can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless they clear their cookies).

I tested this also today, but I'm still unable to reproduce the problem at my end.

You can tell our customer that we are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.

We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

@WaitingOnEngineer As I've said in a previous comment, this is work in progress and will take a lot of time for us to develop (we are talking about a couple of months).

Anyway, if our customer wants to verify if we're on the right track, they can install a test build that would confirm us that the approach we're taking is the right one:

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip


Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.
