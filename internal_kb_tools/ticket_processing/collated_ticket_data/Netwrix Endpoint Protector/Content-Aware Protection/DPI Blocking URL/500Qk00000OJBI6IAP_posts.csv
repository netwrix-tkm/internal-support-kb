UPDATE 23/04/2025

Connected remote to the clients device to take a look at the issue.

Basically they had a blocking upload policy set up but they wanted to add an exception for their ticketing system that's on their online portal and that's where the problem was.

When the users where not added to the CAP policy, they could add files/ make changes to the ticket but as soon as they were added to it, the issues started to show up.

The solution for their issue was to add a DPI allowlist with the ticketing system link and test again.

We tested on two devices and client confirmed that the issue was fixed accordingly.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-23T09:46:48.000Z"
