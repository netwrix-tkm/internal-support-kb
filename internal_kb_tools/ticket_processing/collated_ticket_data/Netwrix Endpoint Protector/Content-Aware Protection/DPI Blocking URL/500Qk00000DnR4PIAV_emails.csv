Our dev team had a look at the logs and said that the issue should not produce when Stealthy DPI driver is enabled and requested for the sslsplit logs which we noticed is missing from the logs submitted.

Can we connect on a call to collect these required logs please? We will need to access the website manupatrafast.com while the logging is enabled.
They also requested the output of the following command 'ipconfig /all' from one of the affected computers



Kind regards

Hi Sumit,

Thank you for the update.  We will need to collect logs while the issue is produced, the best would be to have a remote session for debugging.  Can we connect tomorrow at 3:30 PM IST?

Hi Sumit,

Thank you for your time today on our call. 

We were not able to reproduce the issue of web browsing on our call today but we did enable debug logging and also as mentioned on the call you have whitelisted the following under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > "" Allowlists"" > ""Source Code""
'Java'
Javascript'

and under ""Denylists and Allowlists"" > "" Allowlists"" > ""Other"" you whitelisted:
""Unidentified""

The browsing issue did not reproduce but if there is another incident please take a full page screenshot with the time also in display so that we can know where to look in the EPP client logs.

I will leave this case open and pending on your for further update. 


Kind regards
