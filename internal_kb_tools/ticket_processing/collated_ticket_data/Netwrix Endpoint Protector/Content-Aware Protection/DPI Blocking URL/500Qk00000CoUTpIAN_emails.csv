Can you please give me more details?
Could you let me know if you installed the agent using an MDM tool or manually?
If you installed it manually, did you add the certificate to the keychain and set the Trust to allow all?
If you used an MDM tool did you set it up using our guide?

Hi Eduard,

I can’t remember if it was installed manually or using MDM tool. Let’s assume manual install for now.

No, I don’t believe we added the cert to the keyhchain and set the Trust to “allow all”. Where is this cert and how do I get it? I can push that to all macs with our Jamf MDM. Let me know, thank you.


Regards,
Canan

Everything can be pushed using Jamf. Here is the guide to set it up and the location of the certificate is in the guide.
