This should work with stealthy DPI turned on. Can we please get EPP client and SSLsplit logs when Steatly DPI is turned on? (they were not included among all the logs attached to this issue). They should try to access the website manupatrafast.com while the logging is enabled.

Also, in order for us to make this to work with non-Stealthy DPI, we would like to receive the output of the following command:

--- CODE ---
ipconfig /all
--- CODE ---

run on one of the computes where the issue manifests. @WaitingOnEngineer
