Our development team uses applications like jQuery, intellij, Andrio Studio etc which are refusing to connect to java when the DPI is enabled. The same is allowed and connecting when the DPI is disabled for the user's computer.

Kindly let us know your availability to engage on a call to troubleshoot.
