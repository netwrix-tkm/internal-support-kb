It looks like EPP has started again to block access for mobile iOS virtual machines to any website. We have recently updated to MacOS Sonoma 14.5. Not sure if this is connected to the issue or not, but we've experienced this before and it was fixed in previous versions of EPP. Thank you","","","","Issue was fixed with the previous EPP agent","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI Blocking URL","","","38.5","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Crecan Andrei","2024-06-10T06:31:11.000Z","2024-07-18T18:57:47.000Z"
