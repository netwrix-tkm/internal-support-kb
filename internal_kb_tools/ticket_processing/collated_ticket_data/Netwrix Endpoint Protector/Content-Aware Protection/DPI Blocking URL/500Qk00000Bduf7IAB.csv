"500Qk00000Bduf7IAB","00411451","Support Ticket","Allow specific computer & user to access URL listed on DPI Blocking URL","Hi Support, 
Is there a way to allow specific computers or users to access domains and URLs listed on the Denylist-> Domain & URL? 
We have tried to exclude the computer from the CAP policy that include this entry on the policy, but the computer/user is still blocked from accessing the site. Does this denylist block all listed URLs regardless of the CAP policy assigned or not?

Thank you, 
Regards,
Denni","","","","solved with R&D","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI Blocking URL","","","78.2","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Denni Prima Putra Roli","2024-06-10T07:39:28.000Z","2024-08-27T13:09:27.000Z"
