Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported, that after install EPP client 3.0.3.1 to the new version of macOS Sequoia, some web resources like <a href='https://speedtest.net.ua' target='_blank'>speedtest.net.ua</a> and docs.google started to be unavailable.
I will attach all screenshots and logs.
We suggested to the customer to enable the Intercept VPN feature to test if it will help.","","","","misconfiguration","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","DPI Blocking URL","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-09-24T12:22:33.000Z","2024-10-01T13:35:24.000Z"
