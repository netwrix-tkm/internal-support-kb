Customer name is Privat Bank.
They reported that EPP client is blocking Chatgpt URL.
After they added  *<a href='https://chatgpt.com' target='_blank'>chatgpt.com</a>* to the DPI Allowlist issue is gone.
But they cannot hold it fully allowed for DPI due to security measure.
Could you please review the logs and suggest how they could fix the issue with Chatgpt availability, but not to allow it fully?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-11T09:57:26.000Z"

-The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.
- If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.
- Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.
- opened R&D escalation","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-03-10T14:54:59.000Z"

- The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip
- DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-04-03T12:47:54.000Z"
