Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.

User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.

Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.

Content Remediation Request Canceled by User 2025-01-23 12:01:23 dnh0-1-665 dn171183kmm2 Web Upload -> r.logr-ingest.com Chrome Web Browser r.logr-ingest.com 1.15 MB N/A -

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.

Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.

If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.

Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Alin Anca

Hello,


Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.
User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.
Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.
Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.
If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.
Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Hello,

Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).

The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip

Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
We are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.
We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

I have received an update regarding the spike that we currently investigating, and have a workaround for this:
You can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes).

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.

If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.

Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Best regards,

Hello,


Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).

Hello,

Thank you for this build.
So, customer needs to check how this EPP build works with the ChatGPT?
Also, it may be possible that customer will refuse to install this build and will be waiting for the fully functional test version to check all the functionalities.

Hi Danylo,

The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip

Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
We are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.
We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

I have received an update regarding the spike that we currently investigating, and have a workaround for this:
You can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes).

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.
User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.
Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.
Content Remediation Request Canceled by User 2025-01-23 12:01:23 dnh0-1-665 dn171183kmm2 Web Upload -> r.logr-ingest.com Chrome Web Browser r.logr-ingest.com 1.15 MB N/A -

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.
Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Hello,

Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).

Hello,

Thank you for this build.

So, customer needs to check how this EPP build works with the ChatGPT?

Also, it may be possible that customer will refuse to install this build and will be waiting for the fully functional test version to check all the functionalities.

Hi Danylo,

The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip

Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
We are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.
We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

I have received an update regarding the spike that we currently investigating, and have a workaround for this:
You can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes).
Please test it out on your side and let us know if it works.

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.

User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.

Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.

Content Remediation Request Canceled by User 2025-01-23 12:01:23 dnh0-1-665 dn171183kmm2 Web Upload -> r.logr-ingest.com Chrome Web Browser r.logr-ingest.com 1.15 MB N/A -

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.

Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.

If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.

Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Alin Anca

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
Unfortunately, I can not access the .png files that you attached, can you maybe also attach them to this email?
Also if you can collect a set of log files from an affected computer, that would be helpful.

Hello,

Customer confirmed that adding *.logr-ingest.com to allowlist helped.
At the first time it did not help due to the browser's cash.
So we can close this ticket now.
Thank you for your assistance and have a great day!

Hi Danylo,

They should only test if it works on one machine to provide feedback for us, since DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content.

Hello,

Thank you for this build.
So, customer needs to check how this EPP build works with the ChatGPT?
Also, it may be possible that customer will refuse to install this build and will be waiting for the fully functional test version to check all the functionalities.

Hi Danylo,

The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip

Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
We are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.
We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

Thank you,

I hope you are well.
I have received an update regarding the spike that we currently investigating, and have a workaround for this:
You can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes).
Please test it out on your side and let us know if it works.

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.
User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.
Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.
Content Remediation Request Canceled by User 2025-01-23 12:01:23 dnh0-1-665 dn171183kmm2 Web Upload -> r.logr-ingest.com Chrome Web Browser r.logr-ingest.com 1.15 MB N/A -

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.
Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.
If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.
Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Hello,

Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).

Hello,
 

Customer confirmed that adding *.logr-ingest.com to allowlist helped.

At the first time it did not help due to the browser's cash.
So we can close this ticket now.

Thank you for your assistance and have a great day!

Hi Danylo,

They should only test if it works on one machine to provide feedback for us, since DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content.

Hello,

Thank you for this build.

So, customer needs to check how this EPP build works with the ChatGPT?

Also, it may be possible that customer will refuse to install this build and will be waiting for the fully functional test version to check all the functionalities.

Hi Danylo,

The R&D team provided a test build for this issue, please only install it on 1 or 2 machines, as this is not fully functional:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp24032025/EppClient_v6.2.5.0004.zip

Please note that this is a test build and that DPI does not block or inspect content with this build, it just decrypts the content. There is still a lot of work for us to be able to inspect and control HTTP/2 content.

Hi Danylo,

I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
We are not able to reproduce this issue, but we are working on a feature (HTTP/2 support for DPI) that might fix the issue they reported.
We will try to provide a preview test build once we have a working prototype, but until then our customer has to be patient and rely on the ""allow-listing"" solution.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
A workaround while we're investigating is to temporarily disable DPI, access chatgpt.com and pass the  Cloudflare challenge in the web browser. After that you can enable DPI and the chatgpt.com website should be accessible for a while (unless you clear the cookies).
The engineering team is continuing their investigation in the meantime.

Thank you,

Hello,

I hope you are well.
I have received an update regarding the spike that we currently investigating, and have a workaround for this:
You can allow-list the domain: ""*.logr-ingest.com"" (without the quotes).
Please test it out on your side and let us know if it works.

Hello,

Customer again recreated this case.

User cannot access the https://chatgpt.com/ after Cloudflare captcha check. After EPP client was stopped, user successfully entered this page.

Then, when they tried to go to the Cloudflare webpage for testing, CAP policy has triggered. In the report, we can see after that the destination details: r.logr-ingest.com.

Content Remediation Request Canceled by User 2025-01-23 12:01:23 dnh0-1-665 dn171183kmm2 Web Upload -> r.logr-ingest.com Chrome Web Browser r.logr-ingest.com 1.15 MB N/A -

We do ot know if it could be the reason of this issue, but perhaps you can advice what to add to the allowlist to prevent this Cloudflare captcha failure.

Currently customer has *challenges.cloudflare.com* in their DPI allowlist.

Hello,

The exact behavior is that the user cannot pass the Cloudflare ""humanity"" check, and as a result, ChatGPT does not load.

If DPI is disabled, the user successfully passes the Cloudflare checks and ChatGPT works well.

Also, there are no CAP events in the reports because this URL is not blocking with CAP, but the Cloudflare check cannot be passed because of the DPI.

Hello,

Thank you for your confirmation.
As I said, there was no blockage detected in the log files from the EPP client.
What is the exact behavior? So before adding ChatGPT to the DPI allowlist, when they access the URL, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site doesn't load?
And when it is added to the DPI allowlist, the Cloudflare prompt comes up, they check the box and the site continues to load?
Is there an entry in CAP Reports logs that mentions that the ChatGPT URL was blocked by any of their policies?

Alin Anca

Hello,


Customer confirmed that logs were collected before ChatGPT was added to the allowlist.
Perhaps the issue is that Chatgpt.com is not blocking directly by CAP policy: it cannot pass the Cloudflare check (""Confirm that you are a human"").

Hello,

Thank you for the log files.
I took a look in them, and I believe these log file was created after the ChatGPT URL was added to the DPI allowlist, because we could not find any Threat blocked on that side, just allowed.
In order to have a better view of what is triggering the block, we would need a log file in which the problematic scenario is recreated (why is ChatGPT blocked in the first place?).
