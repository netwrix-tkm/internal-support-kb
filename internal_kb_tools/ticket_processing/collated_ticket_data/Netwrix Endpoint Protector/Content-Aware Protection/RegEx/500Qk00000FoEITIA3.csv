1. Data uploading on whatsapp web is not blocking.
We blocked web.whatsapp.com URL, because the comunication is encrypted and the Epp client will not be able to monitor it.

2. Whitelisted email domains are not blocking.
We allowed mail.google.com to permit file attachments and blocked personal accounts from logging in.

3. Dropbox data uploading should be blocked but still, itâ€™s not blocking.
Restarting the Chrome browser allowed the Epp client to apply the DPI certificate to the Dropbox web page.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","RegEx","NONE","","8.0","Closed - Resolved","Satcom Infotech","prerana yadav","2024-09-16T07:31:45.000Z","2024-09-24T07:35:51.000Z"
