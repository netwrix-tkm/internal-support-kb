When we are pulling EPP reports from Splunk, there is major changes in it. Till last month, the item details field used to indicate the major data type we protect via Regex but this month it seems to be missing. 

I can best show this on a live call to explain more clearly. Can you please share some available timeslots?","","","","The customer mentioned that we can close this ticket after updating to 5941 version of the server and its official client.","","Adrian Draghici","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","RegEx","NONE","5941","202.2","Closed - Resolved","ZS","Manpreet Singh","2024-08-14T12:32:39.000Z","2025-03-04T16:27:32.000Z"
