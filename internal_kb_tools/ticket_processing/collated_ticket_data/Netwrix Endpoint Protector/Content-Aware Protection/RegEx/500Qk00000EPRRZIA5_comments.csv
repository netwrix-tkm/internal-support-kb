@WaitingOnEngineer 

In this configuration, the information regarding the  regex dictionary name is not present in the logs, so it cannot be displayed in the report.

A task was created regarding this issue #320088

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,
This issue is similar to an issue raised earlier this year in JIRA (https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-3612). This issue was found on 5.8.1.0 based on the JIRA info.

Based on that ticket, an ADO User Story was raised for client team where there will be some improvements related to Report Item Type Regex. (https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/320088/)

Currently, the User Story that I mentioned is scheduled to be released in 5.9.6.0, however we might be able to re-prioritize it to 5.9.5.0.

I will discuss with Product and let you know.

Thank you,
Cristi

"00aQk000008pYz8IAE","500Qk00000EPRRZIA5","On Escalation Ticket # 00418449 the new comment has been added: Hi Cristi - I checked the Jira that you mentioned - (https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-3612)
It was opened by me and also for ZS - but would like to highlight that the problem is different on this escalation,

Although we are talking about Regular expressions and the way they are reported on both cases, on the Jira from above the problem is regarding the fact that the Regular expression ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AS PREDEFINED CONTENT - which represents a different tab in CAP - while on this escalation as I clearly mentioned in the description ZS is complaining about the fact that they no longer can see in the logs the NAME OF THE REG-EX dictionaries - 2 different situations. -please read once again the description of both cases as I clearly highlighted this.


I saw your following mention:
""Based on that ticket, an ADO User Story was raised for client team where there will be some improvements related to Report Item Type Regex. (https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/320088/)""

Once again -as we do not have ADO access we cannot see what does the ADO from above contains - and as per this we cannot reply some essential questions that the customer has:
- what and when did this change occured?
- is this due to a modification on  the client side or server side? - if it's on the client - what and when did it change? if its on the server what and when did it changed? (what version)
- are there any workarounds?


Please try to understand that we need clear information on this kind of tickets - this is the reason for which I escalated it - as the customer will need to present a report  containing this information next week and they need precise answers.

Also - we need you to get back to us with a clear answer -will this fix be included in 5950 or 5960?","005Qk000001nViDIAU","2024-08-30T13:02:05.000Z","2024-08-30T13:07:17.000Z","false","false"

Hello, a test build was created with a fix that was commited a while ago.
@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan  Please provide a download link for the custom build at the following path:
smb://192.168.14.5/Public/groups/_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_09_02/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0056

Also, please note, this is only a test build and should be installed on a single machine to test this specific fix.

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

I hope you are well.

Please provide the following test build to the customer: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp02092024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0056.zip

This test build fixes both the issue mentioned on the Jira ticket (3612), and also the reporting issue that was flagged here. 
If we receive confirmation from the customer that the build is ok, we will try to re-schedule this for 5.9.4.1 (sooner than 5.9.5.0).

To answer the questions you added in your latest comment:

	 - 	Dev team is not able to say for sure when this issue was first introduced, they will have to dig in to see exactly when that happened. 
	 - 	we are not sure until dev team fully investigates 
	 - 	no workaround exists. Please try to apply the test build to see if it works. - it's just a test build, it has not been validated by QA. 
 
Thank you,
Cristi
