Our client, Powerweave (Server ID = F025XQ84) facing the below issue with the Netwrix EPP.

â€¢They have blocked all image formats at every exit point, causing emails to be blocked since the signature is in PNG format. We attempted to add the PNG signature file to the ""Allowed File"" section under Allowlists, but even after applying the ""Allowed File"" rule in the CAP policy, the emails are still being blocked.

Regards,
Anil Bisht","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-30T07:18:12.000Z"
