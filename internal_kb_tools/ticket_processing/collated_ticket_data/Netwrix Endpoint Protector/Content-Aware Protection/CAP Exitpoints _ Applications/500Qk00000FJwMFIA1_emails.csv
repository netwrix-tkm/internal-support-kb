Hi Eduard,

We've been getting Authorization prompts frequently on different machines,
as per the logs this is what gets blocked. It says Web Upload in the log
but there is no upload or file move happening when these prompts show up.

[image: image.png]

I have added the Destination details under the Allow list but the number in
that address keeps changing. Can please suggest what exact address needs to
be whitelisted to avoid the prompts.

Karan

Azure keeps switching blobs. You can use a wildcard in the allowlist and instead of the subdomain that keeps changing add *.blob.core.windows.net
Let me know if that works.

Hi Eduard,
 

Yes, thanks I received it and have installed it on a few machines to test it. But our license expires today, so I'll need to ask Andrew to get some extension period to test it properly.

@Andrew Miller  Can you please give us an extension on the license to test this new client properly to see if it fixes the issues that we've been having?

Thanks Eduard, I have added the wildcard and will let you know if it
still doesn't work.

It seems to be working with Excel for now, but it's only been 2-3 days
since I installed the clients on all the test machines, so I would like to
test it for some more time.

Regards,
Karan

Hey Karan,

Azure keeps switching blobs. You can use a wildcard in the allowlist and instead of the subdomain that keeps changing add *.blob.core.windows.net
Let me know if that works.

Hi Eduard,
 

We've been getting Authorization prompts frequently on different machines, as per the logs this is what gets blocked. It says Web Upload in the log but there is no upload or file move happening when these prompts show up.

 



 

I have added the Destination details under the Allow list but the number in that address keeps changing. Can please suggest what exact address needs to be whitelisted to avoid the prompts.

Hi Eduard,
 

Yes, thanks I received it and have installed it on a few machines to test it. But our license expires today, so I'll need to ask Andrew to get some extension period to test it properly.

@Andrew Miller  Can you please give us an extension on the license to test this new client properly to see if it fixes the issues that we've been having?

Also, another user keeps getting spammed with these Authorization prompts
but when I check the logs I only see this in the destination details. He
uses Firefox, can you please advise on that.

I assume you are using Datadog, in this case, you can either exclude the app itself or add it to the allowlist.
use the exact destination since there are no variations, and if you will see variations make sure there are no destinations that have anything after the .com part.
Let me know if that works.

Also, another user keeps getting spammed with these Authorization prompts but when I check the logs I only see this in the destination details. He uses Firefox, can you please advise on that.

Thanks Eduard, I have added the wildcard and will let you know if it still doesn't work.
 

It seems to be working with Excel for now, but it's only been 2-3 days since I installed the clients on all the test machines, so I would like to test it for some more time.

Karan

Hey Karan,

Azure keeps switching blobs. You can use a wildcard in the allowlist and instead of the subdomain that keeps changing add *.blob.core.windows.net
Let me know if that works.

Hi Eduard,
 

We've been getting Authorization prompts frequently on different machines, as per the logs this is what gets blocked. It says Web Upload in the log but there is no upload or file move happening when these prompts show up.

 



 

I have added the Destination details under the Allow list but the number in that address keeps changing. Can please suggest what exact address needs to be whitelisted to avoid the prompts.

Karan

Hi Eduard,
 

Yes, thanks I received it and have installed it on a few machines to test it. But our license expires today, so I'll need to ask Andrew to get some extension period to test it properly.

@Andrew Miller  Can you please give us an extension on the license to test this new client properly to see if it fixes the issues that we've been having?

Hey Karan,

I assume you are using Datadog, in this case, you can either exclude the app itself or add it to the allowlist.
use the exact destination since there are no variations, and if you will see variations make sure there are no destinations that have anything after the .com part.
Let me know if that works.

Also, another user keeps getting spammed with these Authorization prompts but when I check the logs I only see this in the destination details. He uses Firefox, can you please advise on that.

Thanks Eduard, I have added the wildcard and will let you know if it still doesn't work.
 

It seems to be working with Excel for now, but it's only been 2-3 days since I installed the clients on all the test machines, so I would like to test it for some more time.

 

Regards,

Karan

Hey Karan,

Azure keeps switching blobs. You can use a wildcard in the allowlist and instead of the subdomain that keeps changing add *.blob.core.windows.net
Let me know if that works.

Hi Eduard,
 

We've been getting Authorization prompts frequently on different machines, as per the logs this is what gets blocked. It says Web Upload in the log but there is no upload or file move happening when these prompts show up.

 



 

I have added the Destination details under the Allow list but the number in that address keeps changing. Can please suggest what exact address needs to be whitelisted to avoid the prompts.

 



 

 

 

Regards,

Karan

Hi Eduard,
 

Yes, thanks I received it and have installed it on a few machines to test it. But our license expires today, so I'll need to ask Andrew to get some extension period to test it properly.

@Andrew Miller  Can you please give us an extension on the license to test this new client properly to see if it fixes the issues that we've been having?

 

Regards,

Karan

Hey Karan,

I assume you are using Datadog, in this case, you can either exclude the app itself or add it to the allowlist.
use the exact destination since there are no variations, and if you will see variations make sure there are no destinations that have anything after the .com part.
Let me know if that works.

Also, another user keeps getting spammed with these Authorization prompts but when I check the logs I only see this in the destination details. He uses Firefox, can you please advise on that.

Thanks Eduard, I have added the wildcard and will let you know if it still doesn't work.
 

It seems to be working with Excel for now, but it's only been 2-3 days since I installed the clients on all the test machines, so I would like to test it for some more time.

Karan

Hey Karan,

Azure keeps switching blobs. You can use a wildcard in the allowlist and instead of the subdomain that keeps changing add *.blob.core.windows.net
Let me know if that works.

Hi Eduard,
 

We've been getting Authorization prompts frequently on different machines, as per the logs this is what gets blocked. It says Web Upload in the log but there is no upload or file move happening when these prompts show up.

 



 

I have added the Destination details under the Allow list but the number in that address keeps changing. Can please suggest what exact address needs to be whitelisted to avoid the prompts.

 



 

 

 

Regards,

Karan

Hi Eduard,
 

Yes, thanks I received it and have installed it on a few machines to test it. But our license expires today, so I'll need to ask Andrew to get some extension period to test it properly.

@Andrew Miller  Can you please give us an extension on the license to test this new client properly to see if it fixes the issues that we've been having?

Karan
