We have a new potential costumer that want to work with the EPP on windows and linux. The main point is that most of the ""linux"" demand comes from the use of a WSL terminal in the windows OS. So they use only a terminal without any graphic interface and showed us some transfers that they want to block, does the EPP works on that case? Attaching a image to show an example.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-28T14:15:15.000Z"
