Hi Eduard,

We don't know how to replicate the issue so can't really use the test build properly.

Emil mentioned that the problem might be due to the process name between Teams and Outlook. Have you guys figured out if that was causing the issue?

Kind regards,
Denis

Would it be possible to install the test build on one of the machines where the users were facing this issue and let it run for 3 days?
I think that this will be enough time so the user will be able to confirm if the build works as expected or not.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Emil, 
We've setup a call with an affected user on the 26th of November. But, in the meantime we see more and more users being affected by this. And the common point is that they all started having issues after the latest update of MS Outlook. Is your team aware of this? I would assume that the process names overlap between Teams and Outlook app. But, we cannot risk blocking internal communications within the company because of this issue. Please check with your dev team and get back to us.

We can try to test it in 26th November and collect a new set of logs with the new agent if the issue will be reproduced.

I will also ask internally for some more details. If I will find anything new, I will let you know.

Hello Emil,

As this issue is causing more and more problems with internal communications being blocked can you please confirm that the fix is on track to be included in this month’s release of EPP?

Thank you,

Hello Andrei,

As my colleagues told me, this test build should solve the issue:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp08112024/EPPClient_v6.2.4.0026.zip
We can try to test it in 26th November and collect a new set of logs with the new agent if the issue will be reproduced.

I will also ask internally for some more details. If I will find anything new, I will let you know.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
We've setup a call with an affected user on the 26th of November. But, in the meantime we see more and more users being affected by this. And the common point is that they all started having issues after the latest update of MS Outlook. Is your team aware of this? I would assume that the process names overlap between Teams and Outlook app. But, we cannot risk blocking internal communications within the company because of this issue. Please check with your dev team and get back to us.
