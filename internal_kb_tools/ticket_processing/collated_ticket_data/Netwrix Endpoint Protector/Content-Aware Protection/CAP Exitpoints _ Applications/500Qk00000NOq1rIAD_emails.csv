Hello Flaviu,

Im attaching again.
- No policy works on outlook, right now. But you saw that the test works on
dlptest or dlptestnetwrix
- The regex should be:
b[0-9]{1,3}[0-9]{8}b
and
b[0-9]{1,3}[.][0-9]{3}[.][0-9]{3}[-][0-9]{2}b

One with the mask, one without.

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

They asked the following:

1. I the customer can create a Snapshot of the EPP server(if possible) from their VM or AWS/Azure/GCP platform.
2. If the customer can Upgrade the EPP server to the latest version 5.9.4.1.
3. If the customer can upgrade the EPP agent to the latest line/production agent and then try again to see if it works.

Also please ask them to also try without Deep Packet Inspection enabled and see if it works for them.

We checked some Microsoft forums and we found several cases where people complained about having issues when using Regex with Outlook.

Please let us know if the issue still persists after doing the above mentioned steps.

They asked the following:

1. I the customer can create a Snapshot of the EPP server(if possible) from their VM or AWS/Azure/GCP platform.
2. If the customer can Upgrade the EPP server to the latest version 5.9.4.1.
3. If the customer can upgrade the EPP agent to the latest line/production agent and then try again to see if it works.

Also please ask them to also try without Deep Packet Inspection enabled and see if it works for them.

We checked some Microsoft forums and we found several cases where people complained about having issues when using Regex with Outlook.

Please let us know if the issue still persists after doing the above mentioned steps.

Hi Lucas,

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

They asked the following:

1. I the customer can create a Snapshot of the EPP server(if possible) from their VM or AWS/Azure/GCP platform.
2. If the customer can Upgrade the EPP server to the latest version 5.9.4.1.
3. If the customer can upgrade the EPP agent to the latest line/production agent and then try again to see if it works.

Also please ask them to also try without Deep Packet Inspection enabled and see if it works for them.

Hello Flaviu,
 

Im attaching again.
- No policy works on outlook, right now. But you saw that the test works on dlptest or dlptestnetwrix
- The regex should be: 
b[0-9]{1,3}[0-9]{8}b
and
b[0-9]{1,3}[.][0-9]{3}[.][0-9]{3}[-][0-9]{2}b

One with the mask, one without.

Best regards,

Hi Lucas,

--Updated again--

I have checked, but unfortunately I could not find the logs in the attachment folder or the email.

Could you please resend them to me again?

1. Do you know by any chance if other policies revolving Outlook work? Like testing if uploading a .pdf file(with denylist on PDF file type) works correctly?
2. Can the customer please share the regex they are using with us?
