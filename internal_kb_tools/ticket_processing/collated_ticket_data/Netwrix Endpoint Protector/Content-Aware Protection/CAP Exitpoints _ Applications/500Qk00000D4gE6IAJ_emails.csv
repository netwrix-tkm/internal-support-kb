Thank you for your time today.
As the issue was not reproducible on the computer to which we connected, please check on the other affected computer if the issue can reproduced there.
Once it can be reproduced please follow the steps below to generate a debug log file:
 
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Log File"" and click ""Execute"" then select ""Create DPI Log File"" and click ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Restart the Tally application.
7. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
8. Reproduce the scenario that you want to perform and for which you receive the error.
9. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
10. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.
