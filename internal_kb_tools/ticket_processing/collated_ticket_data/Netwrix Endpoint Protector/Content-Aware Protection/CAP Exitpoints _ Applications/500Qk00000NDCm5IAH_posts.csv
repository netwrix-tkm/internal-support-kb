Hi, we are facing a problem with the DLP product on one system. The system is unable to download files directly to a network mounted drive via the chrome browser, when using firefox it is working as expected. The CAP report is mentioning that the file types are blocked as a content threat, we have not configured any content aware policies to block downloads of content nor blocking content movement over network shares. This is affecting only one system as of now.

Requesting your guidance and support on this

Regards,
Swami Purnamsha","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-22T08:20:12.000Z"
