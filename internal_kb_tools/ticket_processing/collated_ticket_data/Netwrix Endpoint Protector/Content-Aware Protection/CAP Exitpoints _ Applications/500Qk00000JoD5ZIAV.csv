We change one of our policies in content aware protection a few days ago to block and remediate file upload that contains us passport on GitHub Client. It caught many false positives so we removed GitHub client from the policy, but even after removing it (and it goes on until now, a week later) the users complains they are getting this error in their GIT: fatal: unable to read tree.

There are no logs in the content aware report but this issue started happenning after this policy was created and it goes on after removing GitHub client from the policy.

Please suggest.","","","","The customer uninstalled the client and reset the computer and it works well for the user now","","Andrei Pop","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Exitpoints / Applications","","","3.9","Closed - Resolved","Pagaya Technologies Ltd","Amit Markus","2024-12-22T14:12:35.000Z","2024-12-26T12:15:23.000Z"
