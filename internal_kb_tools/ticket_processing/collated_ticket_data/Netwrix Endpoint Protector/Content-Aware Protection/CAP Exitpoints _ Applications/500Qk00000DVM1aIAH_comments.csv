@WaitingOnEngineer we prepared a test build with a fix for this issue. Please find the build at this location on our file-server:

_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_08_29/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0055

DPI must be enabled in order to distinguish between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Personal.

OneDrive for Bussines detection did not work for this customer because they were using OneDrive on a domain ususally reserved for US government agencies and we did not identify this as a ""business"" account.

Hi Flaviu, @WaitingOnEngineer,

Thank you for your confirmation.

The fix will be part of the 5.9.4.1. release which is scheduled to be released in November.

Currently, the fix has not been tested internally by our QA team so I would advise against mass deploying the test build until we have QA's confirmation.

Thank you,
Cristi
