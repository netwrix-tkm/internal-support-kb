Hello Swami,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00439700. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00439700
Ticket Subject: Downloads of media files are blocked via Chrome browser to a network share
Ticket Details: To whom it may concern,

Hi, we are facing a problem with the DLP product on one system. The system is unable to download files directly to a network mounted drive via the chrome browser, when using firefox it is working as expected. The CAP report is mentioning that the file types are blocked as a content threat, we have not configured any content aware policies to block downloads of content nor blocking content movement over network shares. This is affecting only one system as of now.

Requesting your guidance and support on this

Regards,
Swami Purnamsha

Thank you!
