If the Linux machines do not have a GUI, then the users will not get notifications about blocking file transfers, etc., but the actions should be visible on the EPP Server.
We recommend trying it out and seeing if our product matches their needs.
We can schedule a remote session if necessary to have a look together at their scenarios.

Hi we need help with this customer.

Can you please give me access to this ticket? Lucas is on vacation.

This customer has made more questions:


   1. He is using EPP as SaaS (provided by Netwrix). What are the features
   differences against the onprem version?
   2. Why he cannot see a Single Sign On option to integrate with Azure AD?
   3. Why he cannot see an option for the System Backup v2?
   4. What is the disk space for a SaaS offering?
   5. What is the IP Address the instance uses for outgoing traffic? We ask
   because they want to integrate with SIEM and they will need to create a
   network policy to allow this traffic coming from the Internet.
   6. Is there any DDoS protection to protect the SaaS server?
   7. Is there a roadmap to include the feature to block only Smartphone
   and tablet devices via Bluetooth for Linux, while allowing keyboard and
   headphone?
   8. Where is API at the roadmap? Does it include logs?




Atenciosamente/ Saludos/ Best Regards,
