"500Qk00000GmNPKIA3","00423291","Support Ticket","Emails via Outlook getting blocked","Hello, we have users complaining that emails are being blocked by EPP. We do not have Outlook as an exit point. Based on the alert logs it shows the Destination as Microsoft Teams and the Destination Details as <a href='https://outlook.office.com' target='_blank'>outlook.office.com</a>. The user mentioned that they do not use any Outlook add-ons and that they use the Desktop version of Outlook. One of the users stated that they experienced this issue only after switching to a Windows 11 machine, but not sure it is related.

I have uploaded logs from one of the user's machine.

Could you please investigate and let us know what can be done? Thank you.","","The EPP Client was wrongly blocking some uploads on Outlook","A test build was sent to the customer and we are waiting for them to test it.","Solved after updating to 5941","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Exitpoints / Applications","","","147.1","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Denis Pasca","2024-10-08T14:14:27.000Z","2025-03-04T16:47:44.000Z"
