I hope you are well.
I wrote an email on 21st of February, I'm not sure if it went through, I will add it again below:
The domain would be  https://helpdesk.identita.gov.mt/ with wild cards at the beginning and the end ( *helpdesk.identita.gov.mt*).
I will also like to add:
Can you please confirm if it happens with new outlook or just with the clasic one?

Thank you,

Hello,

I hope you are well.
I received an update from our team that the issue was reproduced on my side. 
As a workaround, whitelisting the domain should solve the issue till we find the solution to the general issue. 
Can you please try it and let us know after that?

Thank you,

Hello,

Thank you for your time today.
I could download the attached log files and after checking them I could see that the period for which it doesn't open the hyperlink is related to the scanning of the location C:/PST.
Regarding this, I would like you to please try to exclude the extensions .ost and .pst (Outlook archives) from the scanning.
You can do this from the Settings (depending which apply to your computer - Global or Custom) -> File Tracing and Shadowing.
[Inline image name : image016.png]

You would need to update the policies and restart Outlook after saving.
Please let me know if the performance improved after that.

Best regards,
Alin Anca
