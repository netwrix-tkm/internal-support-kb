Customer name is Privat Bank.

They are asking if this behavior is expected:
Inside the CAP policy, ""Network Share"" is disabled, but ""Total Commander"" exit point is selected.
They found the logs in Logs Reports that seems like to be a Network Share transfer, even if it is disabled.
We guess that EPP is recognizing the Total Commander share like a Network share operation by default, but we want to be sure about it.
So, is it an expected behavior?","","","","Clarification on Content Aware Report was needed.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Content-Aware Protection","CAP Exitpoints / Applications","NONE","","10.2","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-08-02T08:18:15.000Z","2024-08-12T13:38:37.000Z"
