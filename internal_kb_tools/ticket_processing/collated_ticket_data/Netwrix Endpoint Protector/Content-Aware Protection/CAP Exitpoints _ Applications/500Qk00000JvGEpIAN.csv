"500Qk00000JvGEpIAN","00430756","Support Ticket","Multiple Issues with Netwrix EPP","Hello Team,

Our client, Powerweave (Server ID = F025XQ84), has the following requirements and facing the listed issues with the Netwrix EPP.

Requirements:
•License allocation from auto to manual.
•Automatically back up all logs to a local path and then delete them from the server.
•Reports need filtering options by department or policy for better categorization.
•What is the allocated storage size for logs and shadow copies on the Cloud Server?

Issues:
•They have blocked all image formats at every exit point, causing emails to be blocked since the signature is in PNG format. We attempted to add the PNG signature file to the ""Allowed File"" section under Allowlists, but even after applying the ""Allowed File"" rule in the CAP policy, the emails are still being blocked.
•Copying a file through the network drive prompts a file replacement message, even when the file is being copied for the first time.
•The backup of the audit log only displays logs related to Content Aware Protection and does not include Device Control logs.

Anil Bisht
