@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi! This is the same issue that was found in https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/342009. @Mara Dobse  fixed it and it applies here too. 
Custom build can be found here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_11_08EPPClient_v6.2.4.0026
The problem is that Outlook uses the same helper process ""msedgewebview2_exe"" when sending a mail as Teams does. The workoround is to identify the destination and if we detect ""Outlook"", simply change the process name. 

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan  @Krzysztof Staszalek  please help us with a download link. Thanks!
