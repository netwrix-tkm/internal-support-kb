We have a new potential costumer that want to work with the EPP on windows and linux. The main point is that most of the ""linux"" demand comes from the use of a WSL terminal in the windows OS. So they use only a terminal without any graphic interface and showed us some transfers that they want to block, does the EPP works on that case? Attaching a image to show an example.

Best regards,","","We have provided the answers for 7 out of 8 questions. The one remaining has been addressed on EPP-team-solution-engineers
