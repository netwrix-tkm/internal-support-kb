Hope my email finds you well!
Due to our company policy tickets that require testing from customer side needs to be closed with the possibility of reopening them in 30 days by a simple reply on the thread!
But we will make an exception in this case and we will leave this ticket open until Friday. Afterwards we are forced by the company rules to close the ticket, but as mentioned you can anytime reopen it in 30 days- very simple - by a reply on the thread.

Thanks Chris for your time.

Hi Daniel,
After the agent upgrade the GBS script has worked today during the testing. We've kept DLP on the device, WPO1D4CV946WNFY. If it works well this week (fingers crossed), then we can close this case by the end of the week.


Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hi Sudipa,

Thanks for the notice. We checked this morning but seems the DLP has not been updated yet. The machine has been kept powered on throughout the weekend. The DLP was updated last time in Dec 2024.

Thanks Chris for your time.

Hi Daniel,
After the agent upgrade the GBS script has worked today during the testing. We've kept DLP on the device, WPO1D4CV946WNFY. If it works well this week (fingers crossed), then we can close this case by the end of the week.


Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hi Sudipa,

Thanks for the notice. We checked this morning but seems the DLP has not been updated yet. The machine has been kept powered on throughout the weekend. The DLP was updated last time in Dec 2024.

Hello Chris,
I have scheduled agent upgrade on WPO1D4CV946WNFY.
Could you please check on you time if the agent is upgraded to v6.2.4.2 and then if the ssh transfer is possible with the new agent.


Thanks and Regards
Sudipa
