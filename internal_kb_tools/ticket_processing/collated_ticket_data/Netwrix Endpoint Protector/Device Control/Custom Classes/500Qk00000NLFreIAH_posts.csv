Customer name is PrivatBank.
They need to add 1100 USB flash drives to the Allowed Specific Devices.
But when customer tried to create a test bulk with 9 USB devices - Device Wizard added the wrong VID and PID and replaced them to ""Genera"" (look on screenshot).
Customer were using the Bulk enrollment .xls sample from EPP console to add there these 9 USB devices.
When they added these 9 devices by text (not .xls file) it added correctly.
Could you please assist with that?
We also can schedule the remote session to look into it.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T08:16:14.000Z"

- couldn't test during our remote session because their server had an issue with the SSL certificate
- used a certificate from a backup which fixed the issue
- resource usage was high, shadows were taking up a lot of space, around 800GBs
- created an Audit Log Backup to check if it works","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-03-28T06:57:40.000Z"

- the Audit Log backup cleared around 3GBs of logs, the oldest log date appeared new
- CPU usage is very high
- server freezes when trying to upload XLS file for specific devices
- looks like Libre Office modifies the XLS file and it doesn't get read correctly by the EPP server","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-03-28T13:16:47.000Z"
