The customer enquired about steps on how to move their EPP virtual appliance from Nutanix to VMWare.  We advised the customer of a better way and that is to migrate over to vmware by deploying a new EPP appliance and then do the migration using our System Backup V2.  Complete backup and migration will require: System Backup v2 + Audit Log Backup.","2025.05.07:
