Analysis:

   --> see screenshot ""<a href='https://tnc_connection_test_LPTP2045733.jpg' target='_blank'>tnc_connection_test_LPTP2045733.jpg</a>"" attached.
- According to the server logs, client received policies.
   --> see screenshot ""<a href='https://EPP_server_logs_LPTP2045733.jpg' target='_blank'>EPP_server_logs_LPTP2045733.jpg</a>"" attached.

Questions:
- How do these two points fit together?
- What is the actual status, has the client received the latest policy?
