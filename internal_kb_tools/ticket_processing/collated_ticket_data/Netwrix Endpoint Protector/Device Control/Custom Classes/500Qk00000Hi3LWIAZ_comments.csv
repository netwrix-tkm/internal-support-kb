@WaitingOnEngineer

I don't think we have an exact explanation for this request. Most of the devices the EPP client is reporting should have VID, PID and SerialNumber. I encountered in some cases devices reported without a serial, but that was because they don't actually have a serial number. Or yes, it can be that in some particular cases the EPP client can't extract it. For missing VID and PID one explanation can be that that particular device is not a physical device. For example I encountered that for printers that are not in fact real printers (when one uses ""Print to PDF"" for example). If the customer has specific queries, they can try to send us more info and logs (registry entries and some screenshots from Device Manager) and we can try to see what we don't extract some info properly.
