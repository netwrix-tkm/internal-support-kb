Customer name is Privat Bank.
They're asking under what circumstances EPP client cancan't collect the Printer's VID and PID?
Because in the Device Control - Devices, many fields are empty.
They need this information because they are planning to make custom classes for allowed printers and restrict all others.

And also, some Printers have strange serial numbers:
For example: usb://Samsung/SCX-4300%20Series?serial=9N66BFFZC00289E.&interface=1
