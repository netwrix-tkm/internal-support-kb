Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Customer reported that this file also imported with the VID and PID ""Genera"".

Can we schedule a remote session to check this together?

Thank you, I've tried to use exported file from EPP, and it applied successfully, any difference is the file name.
Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hello,

Thank you, I've tried to use exported file from EPP, and it applied successfully, any difference is the file name.
Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

Hello,

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.
Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.
Should we expect some fix in this case?

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:
Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?
Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hello,
 

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.

Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.

Should we expect some fix in this case?

 

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:

Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?

Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

Hello,

Thank you for the details.
But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.
Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.
I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:

What server version is the customer using?

Hello,

Thank you for the details.

But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.

Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.

I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hello,
 

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.

Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.

Should we expect some fix in this case?

 

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:

Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?

Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Customer reported that this file also imported with the VID and PID ""Genera"".

Can we schedule a remote session to check this together?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.
Should we expect some fix in this case?

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:
Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?
Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:

Hello,

Yes, I think it would be good approach in this case, but only if customer will not ask to persist on the current server.

Hello,

Thank you for the details.

But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.

Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.

I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hello,
 

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.

Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

Yes, I think it would be good approach in this case, but only if customer will not ask to persist on the current server.

Hello,

Thank you for the details.
But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.
Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.
I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hello,

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.
Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.
Should we expect some fix in this case?

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:
Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?
Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Yes, I think it would be good approach in this case, but only if customer will not ask to persist on the current server.

Hello,

Thank you for the details.
But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.
Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.
I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hello,

As you could see on the meeting, the server slowness usually is about 5-10 minutes, in some cases more after the import has been done.
Currently there are around 2000 specific devices added.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.
Should we expect some fix in this case?

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:
Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?
Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:

Hi Danylo,

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.

Should we expect some fix in this case?

 

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:

Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?

Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Customer reported that this file also imported with the VID and PID ""Genera"".

Can we schedule a remote session to check this together?

Thank you, I've tried to use exported file from EPP, and it applied successfully, any difference is the file name.
Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Hello,

Thank you for the confirming.

Should we expect some fix in this case?

 

Regarding the high usage of the resources, the question is:

Why this huge server freezes happen only after the customer tried to import the bulk list of devices?

Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?
Usually customer server works well, until they try to import the device list.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your time today!

I checked internally, and Libre Office is changing the encoding of the XLS file and that is the reason why the devices don't get imported correctly.

Regarding the high usage of the resources, I was told by the devops team that MySql is using up the CPU, meaning the incoming logs and shadows are to blame. They suggested a fine-tuning of the policies and file tracing/shadowing in order to decrease this usage.

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Customer reported that this file also imported with the VID and PID ""Genera"".

Can we schedule a remote session to check this together?

Hello,

Thank you, I've tried to use exported file from EPP, and it applied successfully, any difference is the file name.
Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.

We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights

We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:


What server version is the customer using?

Hello,

Thank you for the details.
But I think it does not explain why the huge slowest occurs only after importing the bulk of devices by file.
Because usually customer do not complain to the server slow working, it happens only when if it comes to Specific device list.
I could propose your team to investigate the customer's EPP server, but I am not convinced that it would be useful at this moment, since customer is planning migration to the new EPP instance.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the details!

Since the slowness is usually between 5-10 minutes, and the clients are set to update the policies every 10 minutes, implementing the new specific devices to the clients is one of the reasons the slowness occurs. It is also related to the huge number (around 2000 as you mentioned) of specific devices they have.

The huge size of the file shadows also slows down the server. While the specific devices are being implemented, shadows and logs also get uploaded to the server, which uses up a lot of resources.

Our recommendation would be to fine tune the policies that they have in place, and also use file shadowing only for users/scenarios which are necessary.

Hi Danylo,

I consulted with Adrian and one of my colleagues from the devops team and we believe the server freeze is caused by the implementation of the specific devices on all the computers, hence the slowness after the xls file is being imported. We have 2 follow up questions regarding this:
1. How long does the server slowness last after importing the new specific devices?
2. Ho many specific devices are in total? If there is a high number, it also impacts the performance.

We would also like to take a look at device duplicates, since those are known to impact the performance. Could you please take a look on the server if you can find any? We could also check for this in the backend.

Can it be because of Libre Office as well because of dencoding?

Hi Danylo,

As during the current remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Customer reported that this file also imported with the VID and PID ""Genera"".
Can we schedule a remote session to check this together?

Hello,

Thank you, I've tried to use exported file from EPP, and it applied successfully, any difference is the file name.
Can you check it please by using the Specific Devices menu?

Hi Danylo,

I'm sending you the xls file I created so you can test with that one as well.
The only difference, as far as I can see, is that I didn't leave the first row empty.

Hello,

Customer is using the EPP 5.9.4.1.
We recreated the issue in our environment as well by using the Specific Devices in the Device Control - Global Rights
We tried to add the Bulk of devices using the Device Wizard.

Hi Danylo,

I couldn't use that xls file, because the server said it's invalid.
I downloaded a fresh sample, copied over the details and uploaded that file. In my case the VID and PID columns were successfully generated:

What server version is the customer using?
