- connected with the customer
- restored a backup, but the server is still not accessible, even tho all services are working","schedule a remote session with the customer and someone from the dev team","The customers did not allow the port 443 in Azure and this was the reason why they were not able to access the UI at all.
After adding the port 443 in their network rules in Azure we managed to access the UI. They understood what the issue was and they told me that they were also trying to adjust the network rules in Azure and that they did not think about the port 443. Also, we replaced the SSL certificate and everything works as expected","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Server Access Error","","","48.8","Closed - Resolved","DATA Group of Companies, Ltd.","Taylor Waldon","2024-11-15T19:15:52.000Z","2025-01-03T15:02:37.000Z"
