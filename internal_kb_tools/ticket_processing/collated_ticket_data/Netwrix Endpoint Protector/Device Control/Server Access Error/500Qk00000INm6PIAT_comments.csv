Hi,

Please let us know what certificate was changed?
What was the issue with the nginx config file?
Can you confirm that the issue with the nginx config file has been fixed?
Does the company DATA Group of Companies use some specific certificates?
Do they use custom/separate port in the nginx config ?

Please let us know what certificate was changed?
The SSL certificate. They were issued a new one, and they said they changed it in the console, not from the backend(they have ssh access).

What was the issue with the nginx config file?
It was a certificate key issue.

Can you confirm that the issue with the nginx config file has been fixed?
After removing the new certificate, and re-adding the old one, the nginx test and service ran ok.

Does the company DATA Group of Companies use some specific certificates?
Not sure, I will ask them.


Do they use custom/separate port in the nginx config ?
Not sure, I will ask them.

I will get back to you after the customer answers.

The SSL certificate was from GoDaddy.

No, both the UI and clients use port 443.

Hi,

Use this command to regenerate the certificate stack:


--- CODE ---
bash /opt/functions.sh run regenerateCertsV2Callable 3502
service nginx restart

--- CODE ---




If the issue persists, please let us know if there is an error on the UI. Please provide some screenshots with the error and with the nginx config file.
Thanks

Hi,


I observed that the server is accessed using the domain name.
Please check if the domain points to the valid server IP?
Have you tried accessing the server using a different browser or by using the IP address instead of the domain name?

Please verify the server by executing the ping command.

Is there a firewall that might filter the network traffic ?

If a remote connection is necessary, please consult with @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan  for developers availability during the holiday season.


Thanks

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Cristi, Botond, Alina,
I have looked at the screenshots and at the exchanged messages. I think as long as nginx is started, this issue that the customer encountered is rather network-configuration related.
Please check also on the EPPServer if port 443 is being listened to:

netstat -tln | grep 443

If it is, then if telnetting to epp.datacm.com on port 443 doesn't work, in that case the issue clearly is network-configuration related (port-forwarding from external IP to internal EPPServer IP ?), having nothing to do with the product.

After they fix their network, if in any way needed, I'll join you in a remote connection either this Friday or sometime the next week, during an agreed-opon hour for further investigation

Hi Emil, Botond,

I hope you are well.

As this was already fixed and confirmed on teams, I will proceed with closing this ticket.

The resolution is as follows: 
""The customers did not allow the port 443 in Azure and this was the reason why they were not able to access the UI at all.

After adding the port 443 in their network rules in Azure we managed to access the UI. They understood what the issue was and they told me that they were also trying to adjust the network rules in Azure and that they did not think about the port 443. Also, we replaced the SSL certificate and everything works as expected""

Cristi
