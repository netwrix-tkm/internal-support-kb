We will have to change the certificate from the backend of the server.
For this, we will need to access it via SSH, so we can copy the new certificate over the old one with WinSCP.
Are you available on Monday for a remote session for this? If so, please let me know what your timezone is so I can schedule it.

Very important, please make sure SSH access is enabled to the VM.

No updates yet, but I scheduled a call for tomorrow as well.
In case we can't restore the certificate backup, would it be alright to revert to an older server backup from before you changed the certificate? It would mean that the logs, configurations and any modifications done since that backup would be erased, but the server would be accessible.

Dear Netwrix,
We would like to request an update on this case. The previous technician informed us that we have approximately one month before this becomes a critical issue. However, we would prefer to resolve this as soon as possible, well within that timeframe.
Please let us know how we can expedite the resolution process.
Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Netwrix,

We would like to request an update on this case. The previous technician informed us that we have approximately one month before this becomes a critical issue. However, we would prefer to resolve this as soon as possible, well within that timeframe.

Please let us know how we can expedite the resolution process.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Hi Taylor,

I asked for assistance from the dev team and I will let you know when they're available.
In the meantime could you please run the following command and let me know what the result is?

systemctl start nginx

If it's successful, please try to load the UI again.

Hi Taylor,

No updates yet, but I scheduled a call for tomorrow as well.
In case we can't restore the certificate backup, would it be alright to revert to an older server backup from before you changed the certificate? It would mean that the logs, configurations and any modifications done since that backup would be erased, but the server would be accessible.

Hi Taylor,

In case you missed my previous email, I said the following:
We will have to change the certificate from the backend of the server.
For this, we will need to access it via SSH, so we can copy the new certificate over the old one with WinSCP.
Please let me know if you're available on Thursday or Friday for a remote session.

Very important, please make sure SSH access is enabled to the VM.
