Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

 



 

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image004.png@01DB9F39.E0643F20]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

 



 

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image005.png@01DB9FC2.2285FDC0]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image005.png@01DB9FC2.FC255B20]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We have investigated the logs and found the following error: 

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue. 

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

Kind regards

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image005.png@01DB9FD9.33E029D0]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We have investigated the logs and found the following error:

ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false [CSoapClient::SendRequest SoapClient.cpp:338]

This error means that the EPP client didn't receive the certificate from the EPP server, and we can try a few troubleshooting steps in order to fix this issue.

Could you please check with the user and let us know their availability so we can schedule a new session ?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We've managed to get hold of the one impacted user today, followed your guide to operate the EPP support tool and have now uploaded the required logs to this call.
We'll upload the other user's logs if they are available on Monday, the challenge was we needed a desktop support person to be available as well as admin rights is required to run the tool.

Please review attachment and advise if anything further is required from our end.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client. 

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

 

Thanks for the review and quick response. 

Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that’s required for the session.

Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.

Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won’t be available, we’ll send you a response early next week on this.

 

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Kind regards

Thanks Daniel.

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your feedback.

We require admin access, to be able to uninstall and reinstall the EPP client.

Also, if this step will not work, we will need to access the backend of the EPP server and as a safety measure we recommend you to take a SNAPSHOT prior to the meeting from the virtualisation environment.

Please check with your colleagues and let us know your decision as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Anton

Thanks for the review and quick response.
Before I contact the user, would admin rights be required to run anything on her machine as we would need to make additional arrangements if that's required for the session.
Also let me 1st discuss the findings with the team and get back to you with regards to hosting a session to resolve.
Tomorrow is also a public holiday on our end, so we won't be available, we'll send you a response early next week on this.

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

 

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

 

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

 

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image005.png@01DB9FE7.36678FA0]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel

The impacted users have suggested a date and time of Monday 24 March @ 11:30 am SA time, please let me know if you have availability at this time on your end?

Also, with regards to working on the backend of the application, we would need to discuss on our end as this is a prod server so we would prefer if this action is done after working hours, just as a preventative measure.

Let us know if the above suggestions are acceptable from your end?

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error
curl --versioncurl https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://proxy.rmb.co.za/proxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not. 

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  *   curl --version

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image005.png@01DBA003.57B2C000]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have tried to perform a few troubleshooting steps, but due to lack of admin rights we could not.

As we agreed you will discuss internally and let us know when we can reschedule the session, to continue the investigations.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ? 

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user’s machine. 

The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent – the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

So, we contacted the proxy guys,
We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Kind regards

Thanks Daniel.

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

So, we contacted the proxy guys,
We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed,

Thank you for getting back to us.

Could you please let us know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 ?

In the meeting we will require access to ssh, so you will need to provide us access to be able to control an affected computer.

Additionally please take a SNAPSHOT for the VM from the virtualisation environment prior .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

I have also gone through the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on the impacted user's machine.
The uninstall was successful, but after the reinstall of the new agent - the behaviour still seems to be the same -see snippet below:

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel

 

Ok no problem, we’ve moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

 

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

 

We’ve tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.

We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

 

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn’t communicate back to server, we’ll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

 

We’ll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

 

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

So, we contacted the proxy guys,
We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Kind regards

Thanks Daniel.

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel

Ok no problem, we've moved the meeting out to tomorrow 4pm

https://secure-web.cisco.com/1jUH7Q98fl9VyP8tAOTWU77FyxQkHvoAW0zlrsIvZB18JjHAQVYnP5unpsp3xuYJA4QFcbQpOnu6-xaNLDesaO_f777pko5cqIf9Nl8VIyyInRehDKB3GoOvB0E2kuj1AcMlPsiJ6gJ7pGH7jz0Hjc4J083KNlk_Bvcp9CWgcRLulyy1L_wIaF9UEtwV_5BERcuGo3kqpV1f-6TR_OUIb0fvP2JhPIXqDKXT1Wy1g7MX4ZSp-tyStjdGat1loeHq4o_QBjRuyilFI8Gu4pZwmiVJCNISwpDNc5zjAFp0B8b0Y4UHWX0o3WbXU-XXXeFIo_gKHi7zy-403mZDn0bPP8A/https%3A%2F%2Ffnb.webex.com%2Ffnb%2Fj.php%3FMTID%3Dmcbc27e9baf974d11d9dd2d4462e11b4d

We've tested uninstalling and re-installing the agent on 2 the impacted users, after the installs both agents were still not communicating back to the server.
We then went ahead and tested uninstalling and installing the same agent on our test machines but on ours the newly installed agent communicates back to the server. So, could this issue still be related to the backend(ie: the certificates)?

So, our plan is to test an uninstall and re-install with Koketjo tomorrow morning, if the agent still doesn't communicate back to server, we'll attempt connecting to a with a different VPN profile and see if it connects then.

We'll discuss the outcomes in our meeting with you at 4pm tomorrow.

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Hi Daniel

 

We’ve tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo’s machine.

The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.

We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.

And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.

Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

 

Regards

Shaheed

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

So, we contacted the proxy guys,
We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Thanks Daniel.

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image006.png@01DBA312.E20D41A0]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel

We've tested again this morning completely uninstalling the agent and then installing the new agent on Koketjo's machine.
The agent is still coming up as not connecting to the server.
We connected the person on the same VPN network that Clint and I connect to, but still the agent did not communicate or connect to the managing server.
And we tested on our machines and via this VPN network the agent communication works.
Can you let us know what the next steps are taking the above update into account?

Regards
Shaheed

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Thanks Daniel.

 

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel/Adrian

 

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

 

So we’ve got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

 

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work

Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

 

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

 

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department. 

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

 

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

[cid:image009.png@01DBA314.D92A40E0]

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

  10. curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel/Adrian

Apologies for the late response , desktop support seemed to have been quite busy to grant us admin rights.

So we've got a hold of the user today we tried the following:

Tried with agent version 6.2.3.1 with defdept, it did not work
Tried overwriting with installing agent 6.2.4.2 did not work, did not make a difference(ie: we took the logs with 6.2.4.2)

We then ran the support tool to collect the new logs which have now uploaded to the case. Please review and advise the way forward or the next steps.

Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have performed the following troubleshooting steps:
- we have checked the computers that encounter the issue and appear offline
- we reregister one of them in the backend of the EPP server
- checked the iptables

As we agreed in the meeting, tomorrow you will install one EPP client on one of the affected endpoints using the 6.2.4.2 version and on the other using the default department.

Once this steps will be performed please let us know, so we can investigate this issue further.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel

We also picked up this in the logs of one the machines with an EPP agent which is not communicating:

Could this potentially be the issue?

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

But as Clint mentions below, we really need to find a way to resolve this as more agents are getting impacted daily.

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Sorry, only seeing this now. 

 

We can connect a little later if you’re still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Guys,

So this is what we're seeing in the Schannel logs on the test system after switching on all logging for Schannel:

A fatal alert was received from the remote endpoint. The TLS protocol defined fatal alert code is 40.
The SSPI client process is EPPservice (PID: 11396).

Not sure if this helps or sheds additional light on what could be causing the issue?

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

  10. curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We would like to push again a reregister on the server side and also check the SSL version on the appliance.

If possible we would like to access an endpoint that is affected and to check if doing a curl on the IP of the appliance if this is successful or not.

Please provide us your availability for today, so we can schedule a new session.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, only seeing this now.

We can connect a little later if you're still available but what would you like to do and what do we need to prep for the session?

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys, 

We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Not a problem at all.

 

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that’s assisting us.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:

More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Not a problem at all.

Can we maybe try for 2PM? We can check the appliance, do we need to do a snapshot? I just want to confirm that 2PM will work for the user that's assisting us.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

 

Thanks for the update.

 

So, we contacted the proxy guys,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1ltU52Lm71gBJ4e-uy807qfmgvd3-CMfA48SHtS-eLSk67ngafEXVj7PwCh6yadbTRWsxjsZ0Ns3MZ-OwK4t84-wmcARkBJSiPBD2K6T4rxTqH4IvDr-TnqIQF_9SehueSy8qTrdTACkFcg5KKWtCAU1n1vCrmxGwN8eN9gQ6Jxgz-JZ0IOPt3Rsxa5jQn5mAdjWbKRKaSFJpc08Y4jsyYCojUSYm3hzL9ekvUwDCX5aIt89_yD6NHOR30cdXoLLjAtkeV-lGt0d59OnSKC0ALJYdFYhQWcz0f1EX-Uyr_0J1A_rBbZIrfZeC9XZJjVSS/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://x.x.x.xcurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170curl -x http://username:password@proxyserver:port

Some of the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs:
ERROR Register request failed. cURL error is: 35, schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE (0x80090326) - This error usually occurs when a fatal SSL/TLS alert is received (e.g. handshake failed). More detail may be available in the Windows System event log., proxy: false

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

As we agreed please discuss with your colleagues from the network side and verify the proxy settings.

Have a nice day ahead!

Thank you very much for the reply Daniel.

I've booked a call for 3PM. Please find Webex link below.

in the meantime, we've installed the EPP troubleshooting app. We'll also check a few things related to Curl, Schannel, Tls, etc. and make notes.

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting today we have run the reregistration one more time and observe if the situation persist.

We have checked if with the latest client the issue is still the same with curl error 35 and yes we still receive it.

We run also the following commands to check the TLS version and to check if the curl command returns the same error

  1.  curl --version

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBA418.3AE61850]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Another observation is that the users have different proxy addresses : http://fnbproxypac.fnb.co.za/vpn_pac_base.pac http://secure-web.cisco.com/1HRpx3QMfeBiYm_ypA-51yY56dKeN3VvMe1ZMVCG6knrKgvA_bHYnFcpQoc6uieY9elDfjycYn-1nN-otJgoEPL0RBLryLYhIZZBsTMTD5L2ak5E6Cuoqucf-LFPPA0G0Byacn_Qumlk1ZUOkZLK18ttBGTt54Uie9zUVBKRCCbEc3xUepBmPX7QtbS3fGZk_zrB3utfc1UUOLP_QxnebLBQNniSUhImf-6hegXxpTPDplL19GhJvc_ONn6S2zEvR1PbK8XJr_Kt93mQH5z5hD_aSsBkY1Vt1tvkfd1U_SSSQ2sgKoot_bzLFPdDSd2BytTu9E88frvgt0zWv3BN0TQ/http%3A%2F%2Fproxy.rmb.co.za%2Fproxy.pac

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image004.png@01DBA4A9.A43E82B0]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi guys

Thanks for the update.

So, we contacted the proxy guys,
We asked them is there any internal traffic being routed through the proxies and this is the response we got:

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:
 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:
curl --versioncurl https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :
webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark
 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 
-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref

 

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome.

 

We’re trying to get that sorted, because we’re unable to connect still. We’re requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

 

If that fails, we’ll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

 

In the meantime, please let us know if there’s anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

 

Kind regards

We’re also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

 

We’ll advise once we can log in.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that’s the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they’ve advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

 

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel and Adrian,

Hope you're both well and thank you very much for the comprehensive and detailed response below, covering everything we've done up to this point. It is highly appreciated.

Just to add and also explain why I posed the question about the Ciphers was because I thought there might be something set by GPO on the workstations that's causing this issue and this morning Shaheed and I checked the GPO setting that would be used to essentially enforce this but found that it wasn't configured at all. So that didn't help. We're currently engaging the firewall team to do some checks and will keep you posted on that but at this point, we will provide feedback on this matter as there isn't much more we can do. Will keep you posted and thank you again for the support.

Have a good evening.

Kind regards

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  *    $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  *    $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  *    $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  *   machine_id;
  *    $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  *   curl --version
  *   curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1YUeqzVvub533HKYB_3hmd4WRlP015lg_3OKECMb7_W392gEK-FBE4kTVz5cFOWI2qREoIlMjvIbdwmnETlmTgoHcJc2FSRTxHxaGU8GtBPTIW3bvvFA6QSzeG1H_tMQX_37jG8N1vCI_yxNbQa3hvxCoiWS4dnKeiAocZIIKrJ26Fya8MSzV_Jj5aVzFPdINpJlU3zKXraHUyRtkETz3a8mIpcZUghere6Ifyf2oPcdqrXlMZpnuFKwWE-mc178XgsHq5mPmIM9-489OQQeK0CJpyLxx49c6ISDdE4bPEmXQMRHGPScW_L1Vh8SleuS2/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  *   webservice,
  *   webservicefree
  *   access.log
  *   error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  *    activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  *    tried to update policies and restart service
  *    switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  *    We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  *    Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image005.png@01DBA4C1.751D9D00]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

We're also trying to log into a test machine for futher testing that we can probe and seems the Test system does have the issue too.

We'll advise once we can log in.

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  *   Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  *   We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  *    $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  *    $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  *    $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  *   machine_id;
  *    $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  *   curl --version
  *   curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  *   webservice,
  *   webservicefree
  *   access.log
  *   error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  *    activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  *    tried to update policies and restart service
  *    switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  *    We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  *    Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image004.png@01DBA558.CED65660]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome.

We're trying to get that sorted, because we're unable to connect still. We're requesting an account to this domain that will allow us to log in.

If that fails, we'll try to go to the campus in question and work from there, that should allow us to get onto the machine.

In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything we can check and try on our machines that could cause this problem?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

The proxy team advised we can use one proxy pac configuration on that's the same on our systems to test with. I tried it yesterday and this made no difference but also as they've advised, there is a comment in the proxy pac files that bypasses local traffic, meaning it goes direct on the network.

So this was unsuccessful, the issue persists.

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 


	Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue 
	We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work


 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:


	 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
	 $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
	 $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
	machine_id;
	 $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;



-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:


	curl --version
	curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :


	webservice,
	webservicefree
	access.log
	error.log 



-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark


	 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
	 tried to update policies and restart service 
	 switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
	 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
	 Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60


-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 



 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Thank you very much for the reply Daniel.

 

I’ve booked a call for 3PM. Please find Webex link below.

in the meantime, we’ve installed the EPP troubleshooting app. We’ll also check a few things related to Curl, Schannel, Tls, etc. and make notes.

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image001.png@01DBA7BB.06FE1780]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image005.png@01DBA7BB.06FE1780]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image001.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image005.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi guys

Also....

Does the certificate get installed with the package or does it come from the server?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBA7C7.D4C2FA80]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image005.png@01DBA7C7.D4C2FA80]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

To answer to you inquiry, the certificate automatically gets installed on Windows machines.

For MAC OS, the certificate needs to be generated and imported manually or through a 3rd party deployment tool.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Hi guys

 

Also….

 

Does the certificate get installed with the package or does it come from the server?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image005.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hello,

To answer to you inquiry, the certificate automatically gets installed on Windows machines.

For MAC OS, the certificate needs to be generated and imported manually or through a 3rd party deployment tool.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image005.png@01DBA7CC.23A192C0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBA7CC.23A192C0]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Thank you for following up on this and sorry for the misunderstanding.

To respond to your question, the certificate for communication is obtained from the EPP server side when it does the first registration.

It is located under C:WindowsSystem32configsystemprofileAppDataLocalCoSoSysEPP :

Hello,

To answer to you inquiry, the certificate automatically gets installed on Windows machines.

For MAC OS, the certificate needs to be generated and imported manually or through a 3rd party deployment tool.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image005.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image003.png@01DBA869.3DB90650]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBA869.3DB90650]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image003.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

 

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image003.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image003.png@01DBAA42.D444E550]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image005.png@01DBAA42.D444E550]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image003.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image005.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBAAE2.3C765380]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #439312 - Endpoint Protector agents not communicating to the managing server - [External Email] [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N69zS:ref ]

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBAAE2.3C765380]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBAD84.9A559570]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #439312 - Endpoint Protector agents not communicating to the managing server - [External Email] [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N69zS:ref ]

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBAD84.9A559570]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBADF3.3CC715E0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBADF3.3CC715E0]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBAE0B.EC22D2A0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBAE0B.EC22D2A0]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBAE16.8DA7CEA0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBAE16.8DA7CEA0]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Hi Guys,

 

I just wanted to check on this, I’m looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server’s Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

 

[Inline image name : image006.png]

 

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I’m asking because I’m wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn’t permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

 

We will check this anyway and advise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image004.png@01DBAE17.C717FB00]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;


-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N69zS:ref


Hi Guys,

I just wanted to check on this, I'm looking in the capture that I took on my machine and I see that the EPP server's Hello response to the Client is via the following 128-bit key cipher:

[cid:image006.png@01DBAE17.C717FB00]

Does the server set to respond with this by default? I'm asking because I'm wondering if the issue could be due to a policy that doesn't permit applications to communicate on 128-bit key ciphers. I see there is a way to actually limit this by GPO, so we will check the test system tomorrow but also just wanted to understand how the server is set up to respond and what would happen if this is indeed the case?

We will check this anyway and advise.

Kind regards

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 
how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : epp5900.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : epp5910.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : 5920.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : 5930.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

 activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170"" tried to update policies and restart service  switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149 We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60

-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 Ubuntu 22

ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

 

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.

As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image. 

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images). 

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image009.png@01DBAEBA.26E82620]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

  1.   activated Wireshark logs and set filters for your EPP like ""host 10.5.8.170""
  2.   tried to update policies and restart service
  3.   switched the client to communicate to their staging server - 10.5.8.149
  4.   We checked that TLS1.2 is enabled in registries for that test system - result -> Enabled
  5.   Checked curl command for Forcepoint IP -adding a screenshot for comparison - the 10.5.8.170 and 10.5.8.149 are EPP while the 10.5.8.178 is Forcepoint one - The EPP ones receiving curl 35 while Forcepoint is connected receives curl 60
-> Out of the Wireshark logs, we found out a TLS error with handshake failure. Also suggesting the fact that the Endpoint is not reaching the EPP server IP

Regarding your last question about the ciphers, we have checked internally with EPP server on Ubuntu 18 and compared with the latest image that we have sitting on Ubuntu 22.
Below, you can see that both are having exactly the same ciphers version:
 Ubuntu 18

-> Since this exact same version of ciphers is present on the latest version of EPP server, we can say that the ciphers are not responsible for the situation encountered.


As a conclusion after analysing all of the above with client and DevOps teams, our R&D suggested that this might be caused by either something in networking / firewall or by a conflict with other third apps which come preinstalled with the Windows image.

Further suggestions would be to eliminate one by one the other third party apps and perhaps to have another clean install of the client afterwards with a restart between uninstall and reinstall.

If this won't have any effect you should check internally with dedicated teams (firewall , networking, OS deployment-images).

We are at your disposal for any test that you would like to perform on the server side (ssh) .

Looking forward for your decision regarding the next steps.

Best regards,

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint, 

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams): 

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted. 
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

 $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name'; $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id; $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =machine_id; $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

curl --versioncurl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.2 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.1 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170curl --tlsv1.3 https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170openssl s_client -connect 10.5.8.170:443 -tls1_2openssl --versioncurl -k -vvvvvvvvv https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

webservice,webservicefreeaccess.logerror.log 

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .

- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image009.png@01DBAEBF.341BB820]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version
  2.  curl https://secure-web.cisco.com/1fT8C1kt840-9nYa6sjB0oVR3HodCi_Z4XGm4keIRjJV-1AIBusUP6VbGDNUNZhxp7VCko9uLx_IuzY-PzDe1BrFNU7zPYaFJzggiJoX9aNONy22afvTKMfOuZCdUTw_ConB7daiMJjex2xLEq1n9IUhtpBfMXI9y1S9yuFJG6K_u1DojQrsG4jHjWOfAjRYFBr2O2H7NzEgfiq23uM1NWNsfYXm5fMOjKjJbOFcI0SgNCoPAp3zbIK2JbfuA7QmVSwatUn9ALqH1UkJryeNR-XpgUXdNbfSZqx4uSstkCk0QklbT0S4CrFV_fUcCMDFY/https%3A%2F%2F10.5.8.170

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

 

Kind Regards,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #439312 - Endpoint Protector agents not communicating to the managing server - [External Email] [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N69zS:ref ]

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image009.png@01DBAEC0.CC29D8D0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Hello Shaheed, Clint,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We would like to send you a complete summary of what steps and checks we have performed during our sessions, also we attached here our offline investigation that we performed with our R&D team (both client and DevOps teams):

- we have checked if the telnet command is able to communicate with the EPP Server, from the affected endpoint -> the test was successful
- we have uninstall the client and remove the database and logs in order to eliminate the doubt of having a corrupt client installed. -> the situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.3.1 with default department, to eliminate any possible situation caused by a different department -> R&D confirmed that this shouldn't happened, situation persisted.
- we install agent version 6.2.4.2 (latest available client), to test also with the newest client -> situation persisted

- due to the fact that we observed in the client debugging logs the ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35""
- we have performed a reregistration for this specific endpoint (Koketjo's computer) using the following commands:

  1.   $ select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
  2.   $ UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
  3.   $ UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id =
  4.  machine_id;
  5.   $ DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

-> the issue persist after we restart the computer

- since we observed that the reregister did not work we proceeded investigating with the help of curl command directly from the endpoint CMD the connectivity to the EPP server without involving the EPP client:

  1.  curl --version

-> the commands provide us the same error as the one we find in the EPP logs, ""Sending a request with no certificate context. ERROR  Register request failed. cURL error is: 35"" .

- as instructed be our R&D team we have checked the following logs from the EPP server, in order to find any related logs for the following affected machines - Minesh's 10.7.96.226 and Koketjo's 10.7.101.195 :

  1.  webservice,
  2.  webservicefree
  3.  access.log
  4.  error.log

-> we couldn't find any of the IP's of the systems that are not communicating, sign that the endpoints are not even reaching the server .


- after another internal meeting with our R&D, both teams ( client and Devops) we decided to check the logs from one of your test environments, where the issue is reproducing with the help of Wireshark

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Guys, 

 

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

 

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow – it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:

[Inline image name : image009.png]

 

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

 

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

 

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

 

From your suggestions we’ve done the following:

 

Engaged with the Firewall team - we’ve tested with them while live on a call  and they’ve checked their logs as well – the firewall rules are not an issue We’ve disabled all the AV with help from our AV team – disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender – attempted connecting the agent – still does not work

 

We’re going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image009.png@01DBAECA.8C460EF0]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Kind Regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Hope you guys had a good weekend.

We had a look at the Wireshark logs again on our end, please have a look at snip below where we have highlighted in Yellow - it seems like the server has responded, meaning traffic is reaching the server:
[cid:image009.png@01DBAECD.5D93FD30]

Is there a log on server, where we can see why the server does not like what the client is presenting it with?

Regards,

Hi Adriaan and Daniel

Thanks for the detailed update you sent.

From your suggestions we've done the following:


  1.  Engaged with the Firewall team - we've tested with them while live on a call  and they've checked their logs as well - the firewall rules are not an issue
  2.  We've disabled all the AV with help from our AV team - disabled Cisco AMP, Umbrella and MS Defender - attempted connecting the agent - still does not work

We're going to continue to reach out to the ISE team as well as the Active Directory team to check if the GPO has a policy enabled that could impact the EPP agent communication.

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier. 

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;

As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required. 

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

 

Hi Daniel,

 

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

 

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

 

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday . 

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Clint, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We can connect starting 11:00 your time, just share with us the meeting link. 

I'm updating the EPP server and reply back here with the findings for the next two versions.

Have a nice day ahead!

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Please advise on Shaheed’s email below. We’re being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Hi Daniel,

Hope you're well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

Yes, let's please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I'll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier.

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;


As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required.

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Guys,

Please advise on Shaheed's email below. We're being asked why we cannot retrieve more information on these server replies from the server logs on this end as it may provide insight into why the agent connections are failing?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

Hope you’re well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

 

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

 

Yes, let’s please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I’ll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier. 

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;

As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required. 

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

 

Hi Daniel,

 

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

 

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

 

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

 

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

Hope you're well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

Yes, let's please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I'll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier.

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;


As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required.

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your update!

Nothing should be changed from our side on that perspective.

Looking forward for your reply after your meeting with the AD team.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hope you're well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

Yes, let's please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I'll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier.

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;


As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required.

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Daniel,

 

Hope you’re well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

 

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

 

Yes, let’s please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I’ll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier. 

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;

As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required. 

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

 

Hi Daniel,

 

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

 

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

 

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday . 

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image003.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.

Could you please let us know the availability you have for Monday, so we can discuss also with our colleagues? 

Also, please let us know how are the tests going .

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

You’re most welcome. We’ll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we’re encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites. 

 

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

 

Kind regards

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We had a discussion on our end, and this is not the test we wanted to do. Can you please assist with adding the original ciphers used for 5941 and add only these 4 ciphers to the ciphers used in version 5941 to our staging environment:

AES256-SHA256
AES128-SHA256
AES256-SHA
AES128-SHA

Pleas let me know when you have availability so that we can set up another Webex session from our end.

Hi Daniel,

Hope you're well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

Yes, let's please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I'll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier.

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;


As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required.

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we're seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We're just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday .

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We can connect starting 11:00 your time, just share with us the meeting link.

I'm updating the EPP server and reply back here with the findings for the next two versions.

Have a nice day ahead!

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it's complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn't possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We're having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there's an AD policy in place that's affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don't know when this was introduced and what exactly it's doing but might find out tomorrow because I don't think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.

Could you please let us know the availability you have for Monday, so we can discuss also with our colleagues?

Also, please let us know how are the tests going .

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

You're most welcome. We'll have to move it out because we will be engaging our AD team later this afternoon around 3PM. From additional testing and checks, it seems like the issue we're encountering might be due to a GPO policy so we would like to engage the Active Directory team to unpack the differences in the affected area and the larger environment. This appears to be something related to cipher suites.

So can we get back to you guys following that session? Perhaps we can engage on Monday?

Kind regards

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We had a discussion on our end, and this is not the test we wanted to do. Can you please assist with adding the original ciphers used for 5941 and add only these 4 ciphers to the ciphers used in version 5941 to our staging environment:

 

	AES256-SHA256
	
	AES128-SHA256
	
	AES256-SHA
	
	AES128-SHA
	

 

Pleas let me know when you have availability so that we can set up another Webex session from our end.

 

Regards,

Hi Daniel,

 

Hope you’re well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

 

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

 

Yes, let’s please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I’ll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier. 

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;

As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required. 

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

 

Hi Daniel,

 

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

 

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

 

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday . 

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Clint, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

We can connect starting 11:00 your time, just share with us the meeting link. 

I'm updating the EPP server and reply back here with the findings for the next two versions.

Have a nice day ahead!

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image007.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

 

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

 

Kind regards

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We had a discussion on our end, and this is not the test we wanted to do. Can you please assist with adding the original ciphers used for 5941 and add only these 4 ciphers to the ciphers used in version 5941 to our staging environment:

AES256-SHA256
AES128-SHA256
AES256-SHA
AES128-SHA

Pleas let me know when you have availability so that we can set up another Webex session from our end.

Regards,

Hello,

As a summary for today's meeting - we replaced the ciphers on the Staging EPP server 5941 version with  the ones from 5940 and agreed that we will have a sync regarding the results next week after testing the connectivity once again.
Have a nice weekend ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Hope you’re well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

Yes, let’s please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I’ll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier.

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;


As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required.

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday .

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Clint,

Thank you for getting back to us.

We can connect starting 11:00 your time, just share with us the meeting link.

I'm updating the EPP server and reply back here with the findings for the next two versions.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Good day Daniel,

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting .

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally.


  1.  how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint?
  2.  if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04
  3.  are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .
We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same.
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are :
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5900]

For 5.9.1.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[epp5910]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5920]

For 5.9.3.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[5930]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.


We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .
 Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Apologies for not responding to your last email. It wasn’t possible to have a session today, unfortunately but we might be able to have one tomorrow afternoon. We’re having a session with the AD team tomorrow to discuss a solution to this issue after testing a possible fix today that worked on an affected machine. So, we will have more information after this session tomorrow. Right now, it seems that there’s an AD policy in place that’s affecting the Cipher that the EPP server is using, we don’t know when this was introduced and what exactly it’s doing but might find out tomorrow because I don’t think anything changed on the EPP Server in terms of the Cipher Suite in use or the order?

Kind regards

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We had a discussion on our end, and this is not the test we wanted to do. Can you please assist with adding the original ciphers used for 5941 and add only these 4 ciphers to the ciphers used in version 5941 to our staging environment:

 

	AES256-SHA256
	
	AES128-SHA256
	
	AES256-SHA
	
	AES128-SHA
	

 

Pleas let me know when you have availability so that we can set up another Webex session from our end.

 

Regards,

Hello,

As a summary for today's meeting - we replaced the ciphers on the Staging EPP server 5941 version with  the ones from 5940 and agreed that we will have a sync regarding the results next week after testing the connectivity once again.
Have a nice weekend ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Hope you’re well and apologies for not responding sooner, I missed your message below yesterday.

 

Thank you for doing the checks and for the reply below.

 

Yes, let’s please see if we can make some test changes in the staging environment. I’ll book a session for us for 1PM today if that still works for you and Adrian?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case. 

Unfortunately due to the fact that many members of the team were out because of the Easter Holidays, we couldn't reach to you earlier. 

We are getting back to you with a response regarding the ciphers, after consulting with our senior developer colleague for the Server team:
As you can observe in the following the ciphers from the EPP server changed after 5.9.4.0 version, respectively in 5.9.4.1 and 5.9.4.2, the change consist in removing some of the deprecated ciphers.

 5941 and 5942 ciphers are:

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;

5940 cyphers are:

AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;

As we consulted with our colleagues, even if the ciphers were modified, in your situation communication problems could have appeared only for very old clients, since the modifications that we performed were to remove the deprecated old ciphers.

Since in your situation we are talking about Windows 11, latest EPP client version and the fact that on some of the same version clients and Windows, we believe that we can exclude that the ciphers are part of the culprit.

If you would like, we can even put back the old ciphers on your staging server(to avoid affecting the production ), in order to see if that have any improvements for the affected test endpoints.

Adrian will be available for a session tomorrow starting with 13;00 South Africa time, if it is required. 

Have a nice day ahead!!!

Best regards,

Thank you very much Daniel, I responded to an earlier mail, but will also just post the same information here

 

Hi Daniel,

 

Thank you for assisting with the storage hiccup and for doing the checks on the 5.9.4 and 5.9.4.1 environment, will wait for your feedback on that.

 

Just to pose the question here formally on the support case, due to our server being based on Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that we have a limited amount of usable ciphers and since we’re seeing issues in one of our areas where they are limited with the amount of ciphers they can use, so we were wondering if it would be possible to add compliant ciphers to our server that is available in this area? This is something we can potentially test first in our staging environment if this can be done.

 

We’re just considering all possible options that can resolve this issue, by trying to cater to all scenarios in our environment. Kindly check if this would be possible?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your  time in today's session .

In the meeting we have removed the error.log that we have created yesterday . 

We will check the cyphers for the 5.9.4.0 version and 5.9.4.1 and get back to you as soon as possible. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Good day Daniel,

 

Thank you for doing these checks and for reverting. I see that the ciphers are not changing through the version upgrade/updates. Could I please ask that you check v5.9.4.0 and v5.9.4.1 as well?

 

Also, I see that when we log on to our EPP server, it’s complaining about low storage, I think this is due to the log file we created. Can we see if we can clear that when you have some time?

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed, 

Thank you for your time in yesterday meeting . 

In the session we have discussed about the EPP server cyphers and you had a couple of questions that we had to verify them internally. 
 

how the server decides what ciphers to use for communication with endpoint? if there are any custom modifications brought to the ciphers compared to a regular Ubuntu 18.04are there any specific settings on the server to use this chipers not this ?

For the question 1 and 3 we have setup on the server this option ""ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;"" , which means that the agent will follow the order of the cyphers from the server.
Regarding the second question, we do have setup our nginx which by default use : ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5 cf  .

We have also verified as discussed if the cyphers are being changed after the EPP server update and the answer is no. The cyphers remain the same. 
For example on version 5.9.0.0 the cyphers are : 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image004.png]

For 5.9.1.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image005.png]

For 5.9.2.0
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image006.png]

For 5.9.3.0 
AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
[Inline image name : image007.png]

Once this update was performed, we have also restart the server and verified if the epp.nginx.conf file has been modified since we started the updates.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

I think we need to check if the server is recording the handshake failures because that is a question we were asked, so if that requires someone from Devops, then yes, please.

 

At this stage it does appear to be GPO related and the AD team is investigating but from our end, we would also like to fully understand what is recorded on the server side in terms of logging and also what is configured in terms of the ciphers.

 

Kind regards

Hello Clint, Shaheed,

Thank you for your prompt response.
 

We would like to know if the presence of our Devops and Client team is still necessary or if its something related to your GPO policy, so that we know how to organise internally .

 Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
