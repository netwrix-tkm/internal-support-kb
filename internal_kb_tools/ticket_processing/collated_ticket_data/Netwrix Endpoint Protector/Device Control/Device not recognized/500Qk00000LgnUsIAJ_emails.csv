I asked internally and I got an update for this.
Unfortunately the SD Cards will not be controlled in the same way as the USB storage devices because they can not be properly identified.
I was told that the SD Cards do not have a persistent serial number. The serial number allocated to the SD Cards is not persistent, it modifies every time the SD Card is formatted. Also, the serial number can be modified by the users to any value.

The only way to control the SD Cards is by controlling the SD Card Reader for the machines where the user have access to SD Cards.

Best regards,
Emil
