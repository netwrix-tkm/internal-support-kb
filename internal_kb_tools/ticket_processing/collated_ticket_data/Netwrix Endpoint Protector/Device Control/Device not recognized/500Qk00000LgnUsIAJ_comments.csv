@WaitingOnEngineer

The logs are incomplete.

Why were DPI extended logs collected when we are dealing with a device control issue?
Was the device detected in the EPP notifier?

Please collect logs using the support tool when the card reader is connected (including registry logs and database logs).

1. Why were DPI extended logs collected when we are dealing with a device control issue?
In order to generate the log file the customer enabled the Debug mode from Device Control -> Computers -> mange settings -> debug logging. 

Was the device detected in the EPP notifier?
The device was not detected in the EPP notifier.

An additional set of logs was collected with the support tool. I just attached it (archieve (2).zip)
https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00435577

Let me know if the new logs will help.

I managed to verify and explain the customer why the SD Card was allowed.
But the customer asked if we have any plans for the future in order to control the SD Cards as we control the USB Storage Devices, instead of controlling the SD Card reader.

What should I tell the customer about this?
