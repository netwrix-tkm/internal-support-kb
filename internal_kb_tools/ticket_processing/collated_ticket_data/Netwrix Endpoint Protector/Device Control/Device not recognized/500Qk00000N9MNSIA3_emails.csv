Hello,

here are a few comments on the topic:

  1.  As far as I understand, a smartphone must be recognized as a smartphone. Otherwise, the four device types listed under ""List of Device Types"" would be superfluous. [cid:image001.png@01DB9A5A.24C27720]
Why a smartphone is recognized as a USB modem is unclear here.
Shouldn't it be enough to recognize the smartphone only as one device, namely as a smartphone?

  2.  Furthermore, the smartphone is recognized as a ""Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device type. If MTP is used to exchange data between the computer and the smartphone, why isn't the smartphone recognized as an ""Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol)"" device type?
Hint:
Description of a “Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol)”:
USB connected devices that use the MTP protocol to transfer data such as Android devices, digital cameras, etc.
It seems as if this device type makes the “Android Smartphone” device type superfluous.

  3.  Why is the Samsung Smartphone also recognized as a Teensy Board?
Description of a Teensy Board:
Devices like the USB-based Microcontroller Development System

  4.  If the log report is filtered for a Galaxy S23, there are no results for a smartphone connected via USB.
[cid:image002.png@01DB9A5F.810BDAD0]

What is your opinion of the comments listed?

Thank you for your reply.
I have forwarded the query internally to our engineering team and I will get back to you once I receive an update to this topic.
In the meantime, can you please also generate a debug log for when the Samsung device is getting connected to the computer to see how it is getting identified by the client? 

Have a nice day,

I hope you are well.
Please check the engineering reply below:
This is behavior is expected. There isn't a device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers (click manage rights for a Windows computer on the EPP server, to convince yourself).
The phone will be detected as an MTP device, because the OS will detect it as an MTP device. Additionally, if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might be detected as a ""USB Modem"".
Some phones (with an SD card) can be configured to appear as storage devices to the operating system. In that case, those devices will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device.
Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Hello,

the ticket description does not mention an ""Android Device"" device type!

The question was as follows:
Why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""Smartphone (USB Sync)""?

If the behavior is expected as you have noticed, please explain what function the following device type categories have:
[cid:image003.png@01DBA971.CE31F260]

  *   Why do they actually exist?
  *   Which smartphone models fall under which device type?

From my point of view, a smartphone should be recognized as a smartphone. The same already applies to iPhones.

Here is another example of how a Galaxy A55 smartphone is recognized after connecting to the computer:

  1.  Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
  2.  It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
  3.  And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).
[cid:image005.png@01DBA978.68B69F10]

In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:
[cid:image004.png@01DBA976.C26C15A0]

Result:
Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all of the smartphone's functionalities.

  *   Does this make sense?
  *   And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?

Log files “LPTP2086334_2025-04-07.zip” have been attached to vendor website.

Please have a look at the comments and questions and provide feedback.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

	Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
	It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
	And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).




 

In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:



 

Result:

Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all of the smartphone's functionalities.


	Does this make sense?
	And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?

Please have a look at the comments and questions and provide feedback.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please check the engineering reply below: 

This is behavior is expected. There isn't a device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers (click manage rights for a Windows computer on the EPP server, to convince yourself).
The phone will be detected as an MTP device, because the OS will detect it as an MTP device. Additionally, if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might be detected as a ""USB Modem"".
Some phones (with an SD card) can be configured to appear as storage devices to the operating system. In that case, those devices will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device.

Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Thank you,

Hello,

 

the ticket description does not mention an ""Android Device"" device type!

 

The question was as follows:

Why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""Smartphone (USB Sync)""?

 

If the behavior is expected as you have noticed, please explain what function the following device type categories have:




	Why do they actually exist?
	Which smartphone models fall under which device type?


 

From my point of view, a smartphone should be recognized as a smartphone. The same already applies to iPhones.

 

Here is another example of how a Galaxy A55 smartphone is recognized after connecting to the computer:


	Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
	It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
	And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).




 

In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:



 

Result:

Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all of the smartphone's functionalities.


	Does this make sense?
	And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?

Hello,

thank you for the explanation.

However, a few questions remain:

  1.  Why is a smartphone initially recognized as a Teensy Board after being connected?

Only then is it recognized as a USB modem.
And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).

  1.  Why are iPhones recognized as an iPhone even though, similar to smartphones, these devices are also essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system?
How is this different from smartphones?
  2.  Are the three mentioned smartphone device types superfluous?

I am looking forward to your response.
Thank you.

Hi Christian,

When discussing your reported issue with our dev team, they informed me that there is no device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers. You can see this when you click Manage Rights for any Windows computer in the EPP server.

Due to Android's capabilities, smartphones no longer simply present themselves as ""smartphones."" This term has evolved, as these devices are essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system.

The phone will be detected as an MTP device because the OS will detect it as an MTP device in Device Manager.

Some phones using an SD card, when configured to appear as storage devices to the OS, will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device.

Another thing to take into consideration is if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might also be detected as a ""USB Modem"".

After a thorough review and without identifying any issues, we'll be closing this support ticket in a couple of days.

Hello,

the ticket description does not mention an ""Android Device"" device type!

The question was as follows:
Why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""Smartphone (USB Sync)""?

If the behavior is expected as you have noticed, please explain what function the following device type categories have:
[cid:image001.png@01DBB500.6FADA500]

  1.  Why do they actually exist?
  2.  Which smartphone models fall under which device type?

From my point of view, a smartphone should be recognized as a smartphone. The same already applies to iPhones.

Here is another example of how a Galaxy A55 smartphone is recognized after connecting to the computer:

  1.  Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
  2.  It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
  3.  And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).
[cid:image002.png@01DBB500.6FADA500]

In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:
[cid:image003.png@01DBB500.6FADA500]

Result:
Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all of the smartphone's functionalities.

  1.  Does this make sense?
  2.  And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?

Log files “LPTP2086334_2025-04-07.zip” have been attached to vendor website.

Please have a look at the comments and questions and provide feedback.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please check the engineering reply below:

This is behavior is expected. There isn't a device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers (click manage rights for a Windows computer on the EPP server, to convince yourself).
The phone will be detected as an MTP device, because the OS will detect it as an MTP device. Additionally, if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might be detected as a ""USB Modem"".
Some phones (with an SD card) can be configured to appear as storage devices to the operating system. In that case, those devices will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device.
Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Thank you,

Hello,

 

thank you for the explanation.

 

However, a few questions remain:


	Why is a smartphone initially recognized as a Teensy Board after being connected?


Only then is it recognized as a USB modem.
And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).


	Why are iPhones recognized as an iPhone even though, similar to smartphones, these devices are also essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system?
	How is this different from smartphones?
	Are the three mentioned smartphone device types superfluous?


 

I am looking forward to your response.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hi Christian,

When discussing your reported issue with our dev team, they informed me that there is no device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers. You can see this when you click Manage Rights for any Windows computer in the EPP server. 

Due to Android's capabilities, smartphones no longer simply present themselves as ""smartphones."" This term has evolved, as these devices are essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system. 

The phone will be detected as an MTP device because the OS will detect it as an MTP device in Device Manager. 

Some phones using an SD card, when configured to appear as storage devices to the OS, will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device. 

Another thing to take into consideration is if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might also be detected as a ""USB Modem"". 

After a thorough review and without identifying any issues, we'll be closing this support ticket in a couple of days. 

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

I hope you are well.
We received an reply from the product team regarding your latest questions, please see below:

Regarding your device-specific question, such as why your S23 is registering as a Teensy board or MTP, this is likely attributed to individual device settings, application configurations, and corporate mobile management profiles. These elements are configured independently of EPP and thus, would be best addressed by examining the particular device settings or reaching out to the mobile device vendor.

Similarly, comparing the behavior of iPhone with Android Samsung devices is not really manageble, their technologies and designs differ greatly. Questions regarding these differences are best directed towards their respective manufacturers.

Lastly, in response to your query about the relevance of the ""smartphone"" category, these devices continue to be integral assets for numerous enterprise-level organizations, much like older technologies such as floppy discs or ZIP drives that are still supported due to their usage in specific contexts.

I hope this clarifies your concerns.
Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Thank you,
Best regards,

Hello,

 

thank you for the explanation.

 

However, a few questions remain:


	Why is a smartphone initially recognized as a Teensy Board after being connected?


Only then is it recognized as a USB modem.
And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).


	Why are iPhones recognized as an iPhone even though, similar to smartphones, these devices are also essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system?
	How is this different from smartphones?
	Are the three mentioned smartphone device types superfluous?


 

I am looking forward to your response.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hi Christian,

When discussing your reported issue with our dev team, they informed me that there is no device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers. You can see this when you click Manage Rights for any Windows computer in the EPP server. 

Due to Android's capabilities, smartphones no longer simply present themselves as ""smartphones."" This term has evolved, as these devices are essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system. 

The phone will be detected as an MTP device because the OS will detect it as an MTP device in Device Manager. 

Some phones using an SD card, when configured to appear as storage devices to the OS, will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device. 

Another thing to take into consideration is if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might also be detected as a ""USB Modem"". 

After a thorough review and without identifying any issues, we'll be closing this support ticket in a couple of days. 

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hello,

 

the ticket description does not mention an ""Android Device"" device type!

 

The question was as follows:

Why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""Smartphone (USB Sync)""?

 

If the behavior is expected as you have noticed, please explain what function the following device type categories have:




	Why do they actually exist?
	Which smartphone models fall under which device type?


 

From my point of view, a smartphone should be recognized as a smartphone. The same already applies to iPhones.

 

Here is another example of how a Galaxy A55 smartphone is recognized after connecting to the computer:


	Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
	It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
	And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).




 

In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:



 

Result:

Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all of the smartphone's functionalities.


	Does this make sense?
	And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?


 

Log files “LPTP2086334_2025-04-07.zip” have been attached to vendor website.

 

Please have a look at the comments and questions and provide feedback.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please check the engineering reply below: 

This is behavior is expected. There isn't a device category called ""Android Device"" in EPP for Windows computers (click manage rights for a Windows computer on the EPP server, to convince yourself).
The phone will be detected as an MTP device, because the OS will detect it as an MTP device. Additionally, if internet sharing is used on the device, the device might be detected as a ""USB Modem"".
Some phones (with an SD card) can be configured to appear as storage devices to the operating system. In that case, those devices will be detected by EPP as ""USB Storage"" device.
