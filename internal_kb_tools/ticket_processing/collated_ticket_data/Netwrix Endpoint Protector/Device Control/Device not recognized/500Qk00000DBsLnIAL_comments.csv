From the latest logs found in archive.zip uploaded on August 6th, we can seee that this is an issue on the server rather than on the EPP agent.

The EPP agent is configured to communicate with a server address: 192.149.205.229 on port 443. However, when the agent tries to register to the ""wsf/webservice.php"" it gets a ""404 Not found"" HTTP status, which might indicate a misconfigured/broken EPP server.

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

1. Check if the config file is not corrupted: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml


--- CODE ---
43. Certificates error – config file to be checked – EPP YML
--- CODE ---

2. Check if Increased Communication Security is enabled, and disable it. (Appliance -> Server Maintenance page, Increased Communication Security section.)
After the UI setting was disabled, please also check the epp.nginx.config and make sure the wsf entry looks like this:


--- CODE ---
vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
 
    location ~ ^/wsf/(.+.php)$ {
        #if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        #       return 401;
        #}

        alias   /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/$1;
        include fastcgi_epp_params;
    }

--- CODE ---

	If the communication isn't established:

3. Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack.

If communication is established, and the customer uses a UI certificate, please advise him to upload the UI certificate again.

As requested we:
1. Checked the: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml and configured it as per the documentation.
2. Increased Communication Security - was disabled. We also re-installed the latest EPP client on a computer with it being disabled, but it did not appear on the EPP server UI.
2.1. /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/epp.nginx.conf - we commented out the portion as mentioned + compared their settings with the port separation template and deleted a few more entries that were not present in the template(made a backup of the original file in order to rollback if needed).

One thing I noticed here was that they seem to be running the port separation nginx config file, but they don't have port separation. Both ports are on 443.

3. Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack - did this, but the EPP clients did not come back online.

Please let me know if we can schedule a remote session as the issue is urgent with the customer. Preferably Monday or Tuesday. The customer is in US timezone(EDT).

I will attach screenshots in: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00415281

Thank you!

Sorry, it is a little bit confusing for me.



Does the customer have or not the port separation?

Can you share the backup Nginx file with us?

After you made the described changes, have you restarted the Nginx?

--- CODE ---
service nginx restart
--- CODE ---

I mentioned in the second step that you need to check if in epp.nginx.config the wsf entry exists, I didn't see any kind of information about it. Instead, you share with us details about the ws entry.




--- CODE ---
   location ~ ^/wsf/(.+.php)$ {
        #if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        #       return 401;
        #}

        alias   /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/$1;
        include fastcgi_epp_params;
    }
