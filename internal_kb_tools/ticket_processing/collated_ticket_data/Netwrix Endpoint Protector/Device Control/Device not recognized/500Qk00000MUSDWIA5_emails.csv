Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
For point 1, yes, you are correct, only devices whose date under ""Last seen"" is later than 17:00 yesterday.
For point 2, I have forwarded your questions, but regarding if the missing device needs to be reconnected to the computer, as far as I know, yes.

Hello,

 


	To section „- Please do not add any rights, on a device only if the last seen on the device page is set to be after the intervention finished, which is after 17:01. We know a device is synced only by verifying the last seen column on the Device page. If it is after today, 17:00, a new right can be added.”
	The following sentences are confusing:
	Please do not add any rights…after the intervention finished, which is after 17:01 <-> …today, 17:00, a new right can be added.


These sentences contradict each other.

However, if I interpret it correctly, only devices whose date under ""Last seen"" is later than 17:00 yesterday can be added, correct?
 


	To section “If you do not see a device on devices list, please create a log and the device should enter in the system.”
	The logs report was created both for the respective computer to which the device was connected and for the serial number of the device. Unfortunately, the external devices are still not displayed:



	MMUC1050156:
	
	LPTP2043748:
	
	



This raises the following questions:


	What filter should be used to create the logs report if a device is missing?
	Does the missing device need to be reconnected to the computer?
	 


If this procedure is incorrect, please explain it in detail.

 

Thank you for supporting.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
We have connected to investigate and troubleshoot this issue and performed the following:
- we deleted all the devices on the nodes that were not having rights associated. This was because of the soft deletion which was removed by 7.2.0 update and we needed to clean the database on the nodes.
This will cause a higher communication between the server and the client because the client needs to send all the devices again in order to enter on the nodes.
After entering on the nodes the devices should be synced by the Unify server, which is seen on the UI.
- Please do not add any rights, on a device only if the last seen on the device page is set to be after the intervention finished, which is after 17:01. We know a device is synced only by verifying the last seen column on the Device page. If it is after today, 17:00, a new right can be added.
If a new device last seen is not being updated please delete the device from UI, and after 15 min try making some logs from that device. Then it should enter in the system. 

Question:

Do devices that have been deleted from the list generally no longer appear in the device list?
From 7.2.0, if we delete a device from UI it will be deleted from nodes also, before it was only marked as deleted and when reappearing in the system, the flag was only reset. Now it is added again.

If you do not see a device on devices list, please create a log and the device should enter in the system.

Please let us know tomorrow if everything is fine with this topic now.

Alin Anca

We are investigating now this issue, so our request is to not add any new rights to the devices till we complete the clean-up process.
I will get back to you with an email once this is done.

Can you please remove the right assigned for it then wait for the last seen collumn to pass the 6th of March at 17:00 before asigning a right adain?
We need the device to communicate with the server once before a right can be assigned. Hence, we need to see the last seen date to update before asigning a right.

- we deleted all the devices on the nodes that were not having rights associated. This was because of the soft deletion which was removed by 7.2.0 update and we needed to clean the database on the nodes.
This will cause a higher communication between the server and the client because the client needs to send all the devices again in order to enter on the nodes.
After entering on the nodes the devices should be synced by the Unify server, which is seen on the UI.
- Please do not add any rights, on a device only if the last seen on the device page is set to be after the intervention finished, which is after 17:01. We know a device is synced only by verifying the last seen column on the Device page. If it is after today, 17:00, a new right can be added.
If a new device last seen is not being updated please delete the device from UI, and after 15 min try making some logs from that device. Then it should enter in the system.

Question:

Do devices that have been deleted from the list generally no longer appear in the device list?
From 7.2.0, if we delete a device from UI it will be deleted from nodes also, before it was only marked as deleted and when reappearing in the system, the flag was only reset. Now it is added again.

If you do not see a device on devices list, please create a log and the device should enter in the system.

Please let us know tomorrow if everything is fine with this topic now.

Hello,

We are investigating now this issue, so our request is to not add any new rights to the devices till we complete the clean-up process.
I will get back to you with an email once this is done.

Thank you,
Best regards,
