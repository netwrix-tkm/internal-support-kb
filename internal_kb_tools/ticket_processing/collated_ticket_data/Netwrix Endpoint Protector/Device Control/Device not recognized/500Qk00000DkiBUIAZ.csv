Customer (Dubai Police) has requested a call with adrian for the following technical points:

Customer has the following issues which they also want to check:

1- They want to be added to email notifications sent by EPP for any new update released for the application, they want to stay up to date with EPP, so any time EPP releases a new version for their product they want to be notified about it.

 

2- They are facing issues with agent deployments, they have push the agent from their SCCM to 1500 devices in the network, but in the WebUI they can only see 500, we have checked few devices which had the agent installed on them, they can communicate to EPP server on Port 443, but still they are not showing in computers inventory

 

3- customer had few questions and they requested for you to be on the call to clarify their points.

Please organize this session as soon as possible as the customer has been asking for this session for a while","","","","Confirmed that we can close this ticket as Solved","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device not recognized","","5930","23.7","Closed - Resolved","Dubai Police","aiman Jadiba","2024-07-30T13:47:51.000Z","2024-08-23T06:26:33.000Z"
