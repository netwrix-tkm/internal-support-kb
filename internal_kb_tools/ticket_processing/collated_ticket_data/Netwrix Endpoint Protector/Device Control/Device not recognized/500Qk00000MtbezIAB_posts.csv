we are facing some problems with the computers in our EPP administration panel, in the computers part we have around 212, however, not all of them get the license, and we have 225 licenses, they keep appearing as unlicensed. 
Also, some machines do not appear as online for a long time, and the machines are online and with the Agent installed, in the agent itself it shows that the last connection to the server is recent, but in the panel it is not. 
I've tried to reinstall and it didn't work. Now my machine no longer appears on the dashboard, we have this problem on average of 30 machines, could you help us?

If necessary, I have the screenshots.

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-13T15:17:17.000Z"

— tried changing the IP using the tool without success.
— used the zap tool and reinstalled after a reboot without success
—  the customer will retry the steps using another admin account and install via MDM 
based on the outcome, I will have to check in the backend to see what is the status of the computer and why it is not appearing in the console.","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-03-17T15:14:31.000Z"
