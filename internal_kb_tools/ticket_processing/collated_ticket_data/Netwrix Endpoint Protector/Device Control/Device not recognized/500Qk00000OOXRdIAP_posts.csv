We have added EPP clients on our 3 Linux servers recently which are Ubuntu 22.04 and EPP version installed as 2.4.4.1004, but they are not showing up in the Computer list in EPP from last 2 days

Could you please guide us why they are not showing, it is mandatory to apply policy on them.

Regards,
Diwanshu Srivastava","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-24T04:51:26.000Z"

-it seems that the issue is related to the client-server communication, so I guided the customer to check the options.sh configuration file, that sets up the communication of the client.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-04-24T07:47:38.000Z"
