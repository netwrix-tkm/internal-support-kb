"500Qk00000MUSDWIA5","00437481","Support Ticket","Missing USB Storage Device in List of Devices","Initial situation:
A USB storage device was whitelisted locally on a computer.
However, whitelisting is not functional.

Workaround implemented:
The USB storage device was deleted from the device list.
Delete time: Monday morning, February 24, 2025.
Whitelisting was done manually via Adding New Device (VID, PID, Serial Number) and is now functional!
--> see screenshot ""MMUC1050156_USB Storage <a href='https://Device_whitelisted.jpg' target='_blank'>Device_whitelisted.jpg</a>"".
Whitelisting time: Tuesday morning, February 25, 2025.

Issue:
Since then, the deleted USB storage device no longer appears in the device list!
The USB storage device is, however, displayed in the Logs Report.
--> see logfiles ""<a href='https://EP_Reporting_and_Administration_Tool_USB_Storage_Device_20D11E8010C1.xlsx' target='_blank'>EP_Reporting_and_Administration_Tool_USB_Storage_Device_20D11E8010C1.xlsx</a>"".

Question:
Do devices that have been deleted from the list generally no longer appear in the device list?

Expectation:
Please check why the USB storage device is not listed in the device list.
Please make sure that deleted devices are listed again.
