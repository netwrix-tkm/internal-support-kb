@WaitingOnEngineer 

Adrian, please checked the linked item, I think the issue is the same with the one from Salesforce 00417056.
 
To my knowledge we did have a signing issue that for fixed in 5940, but that only affected Easylock clients. If what I mentioned in the other ADO case does not fix that or this issue, we might need to check also this Easylock issue.
