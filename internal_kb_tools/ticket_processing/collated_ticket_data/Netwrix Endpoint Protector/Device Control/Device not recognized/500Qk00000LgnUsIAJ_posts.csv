A gap in Security has been raised to my attention, where a computer's inbuilt SD Card Reader does not prevent them from using an SD Card.

At present, a user with the EPP Client can use this inbuilt SD Card Reader to plug any SD Card into the computer, to access any files they wish, with read-write permissions. When using an SD Card Reader that is plugged into a USB Port, EPP works as intended and blocks the action. But with the inbuilt SD Card Reader, no blocking action is performed.

This constitutes a concerning lack of security in our systems, as any users who have an inbuilt SD Card reader could have an adversary - Perhaps an on-site contractor walk around, find a laptop that has not been locked and perform any action they wish.

Please could this be investigated?

I am happy to be called or emailed about this Incident.

Kind Regards,
Conor","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-10T11:26:53.000Z"

I have to check if we have any plans on controlling the SD cards as we can control the USB Storage device. I will revert to the customer with our plans regarding the SD cards.","","","","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-02-27T17:46:13.000Z"
