Some computers have been recently migrated from our M&A domain(<a href='https://na.ad.vwr.com' target='_blank'>na.ad.vwr.com</a>) to <a href='https://avantorsciences.net' target='_blank'>avantorsciences.net</a> domain. However, these computers are still reporting with the old domain names in the Cososys console. 

Do we need to do anything with endpoint protector for it to pick up the change? 

I have attached the screenshot for reference.","","","","EPP has been uninstalled","Netwrix account issues","Andrew Siemasko","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device not recognized","","","306.0","Closed - Resolved","Avantor","Karthikeyan Ravi","2024-06-27T17:13:42.000Z","2025-04-29T17:58:01.000Z"
