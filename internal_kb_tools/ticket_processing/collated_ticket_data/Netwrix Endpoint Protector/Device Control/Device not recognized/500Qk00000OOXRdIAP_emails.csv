Thank you for reaching out to us.
Regarding the behavior that you are reporting, it seems that the clients are not communicating with the server.
As such, I will please ask you to read and follow the steps that are present in the README.txt file 

It states the following:

Install:
        Make sure you have execution rights on install.sh (chmod);
        Epp-client must not be installed at the moment of running ""install.sh"" (see Update);
        Set the correct IP for the server in options.sh file;
        Run as root: ""./install.sh"" or ""bash install.sh"";
        If the user is not root, the root password will be required;
        If the user is root, the epp-client GUI will have to be started manually,
        but it will start automatically at restart for the current user.

Please make sure that the options.sh file is correctly configured and that the necessary lines an uncommented as mentioned in the file:

Please let us know if we can close the ticket after this.

Have a nice day,
Best regards,
Alin Anca
