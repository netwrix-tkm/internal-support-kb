Behavior of the Samsung device:
According to the definition under List of Device Types, the Samsung smartphone should be recognized as a “smartphone” device type. In this case, however, it is recognized as 3 different device types, but not as a smartphone:
- Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol)
- Teensy Board
- USB Modem

Questions:
1. Is this behavior as designed from vendor side?
2. If not, why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""SmartPhone (USB Sync)"" device type?

Please check and give feedback.
