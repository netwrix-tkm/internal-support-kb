Hello!

I have tried to reproduce the issue described above, but did not manage. I tried different scenarios but without any luck.
Seems that the device is not entering in the console because it might be stuck, dev intervention is needed to clean up the device tables on nodes.

Hi, we were connected and deleted all the devices on the nodes that were not having rights associated. This was because before 720 we had many duplicates, also because of the soft deletion which was removed by 720 update and we needed to clean the database on the nodes. This will cause a higher communication between the server and the client because we made that the client could send us all the devices again in order to enter on the nodes. After entering on the nodes the devices should be synced by the unify server, which is seen on the UI. Please tell the client to not add any rights, on a device only if the last seen on the device page is set to be after the intervention finished , which should be around 17:00. We know a device is synced only by verifying the last seen column on the Device page. If it is after today, 5 pm,  a new right can be added...If you add a right and it is not synced...no error will appear on UI.. but it might cause inconsistencies and because of this we advise not to. ( We didn't delete the devices on unify and because of this we need to wait for the sync)
If a new device last seen is not being updated please delete the device from UI, and after 15 min try making some logs from that device. Then it should enter in the system. 

Question:

Do devices that have been deleted from the list generally no longer appear in the device list?
From 720, if we delete a device from UI it will be deleted from nodes also, before it was only marked as deleted and when reappearing in the system the flag was only reset. Now it is added again.

If you do not see a device on devices list, please create a log and the device should enter in the system.

To section “If you do not see a device on devices list, please create a log and the device should enter in the system.”
The logs report was created both for the respective computer to which the device was connected and for the serial number of the device. Unfortunately, the external devices are still not displayed:


[See screenshot ""external devices are still not displayed for computers MMUC1050156 and LPTP2043748""]

This raises the following questions:

- What filter should be used to create the logs report if a device is missing?
- Does the missing device need to be reconnected to the computer?

If this procedure is incorrect, please explain it in detail.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-07T14:33:37.000Z","2025-03-07T14:33:37.000Z","false","false"

   We were connected and found out that, the logs from that device appear to be on the 27 of February 2025. In order for the device to appear on the UI, one should make a connect with that device so a new log could be triggered and device added in the system. Because of this the device is not present in the system.

    Also we found out that a new right was added to global rights, one that had last_seen before the 6th of march...and because of this the right did not propagate ok to the nodes. That should be deleted from UI because it is not taken into consideration.
   We could delete the last seen and on UI would be empty...or we could delete the devices prior to 6th of March that do not have rights applied...so no right could be added with inconsistencies.
