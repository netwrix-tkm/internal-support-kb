The ticket description does not mention an ""Android Device"" device type.

The question was as follows:

Why is the Galaxy S23 smartphone not recognized as a ""Smartphone (USB Sync)""?


If the behavior is expected as you have noticed, please explain what function the following device type categories have:


- Why do they actually exist?
- Which smartphone models fall under which device type?

 From my point of view, a smartphone should be recognized as a smartphone. The same already applies to iPhones.

Here is another example of how a Galaxy A55 smartphone is recognized after connecting to the computer:

Once plugged in, it is first recognized as a Teensy Board.
It is then recognized as a USB Modem.
And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).


In the device manager it is listed under portable devices:
 

Result:

Theoretically, three different permissions are required to use all the smartphone's functionalities.

Does this make sense?
And why is the smartphone recognized as a Teensy Board?

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi @Alin Anca, @Eduard-Alexandru Nut,

Queries like this can be quite confusing. When customers pose such questions, they should consider that with Android phones, you can configure how the USB connection behaves in the phone settings. As an owner of a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, I conducted a quick test and verified that the device is recognized differently by the OS and EPP Client, depending on the configured mode, such as MIDI-audio device, MTP, or USB stick.

Due to Android's capabilities, smartphones no longer simply present themselves as ""smartphones."" The term ""smartphone"" has evolved, as these devices are essentially full-featured computer platforms with an operating system. In the EPP category, ""smartphone"" refers to a more traditional definition, like Symbian or WindowsPhone devices, etc. where the option to announce to the OS as a smartphone was available.

Please coordinate with the Customer Success Management (CSM) team regarding the wording and redirect this query back to the customer.
Developer escalation has been declined.

Thank you for your cooperation.
BR, Krzysiek

Based on the explanation, the customer came back with a reply, please see below:

Thank you for the explanation.

However, a few questions remain:

1. Why is a smartphone initially recognized as a Teensy Board after being connected?
    Only then is it recognized as a USB modem.
    And if the transfer protocol is enabled, it is finally recognized as a Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol).

2. Why are iPhones recognized as an iPhone even though, similar to smartphones, these devices are also essentially full-featured 
    computer platforms with an operating system?
    How is this different from smartphones?
3. Are the three mentioned smartphone device types superfluous?

Hi @Alin Anca, @Eduard-Alexandru Nut

Thank you for reaching out with your questions. I wanted to clarify the nature of our support scope in relation to the inquiries you've raised.
Please also algin with our Customer Success Team, they are well-equipped to guide you through these nuances and support query resolution effectively at this level, as this case has been not well managed on our support side.

These questions are more geared towards device-specific and general IT concerns rather than technical issues directly pertaining to our Endpoint Protector (EPP) product. Therefore, they do not fall under the types of inquiries typically escalated to our development team. 

Regarding your device-specific question, such as why your S23 is registering as a Teensy board or MTP, this is likely attributed to individual device settings, application configurations, and corporate mobile management profiles. These elements are configured independently of EPP and thus, would be best addressed by examining the particular device settings or reaching out to the mobile device vendor.

Similarly, comparing the behavior of iPhone with Android Samsung devices is akin to comparing the characteristics of a BMW and a Mercedes—while both are luxury brands, their technologies and designs differ greatly. Questions regarding these differences are best directed towards their respective manufacturers.

Lastly, in response to your query about the relevance of the ""smartphone"" category, these devices continue to be integral assets for numerous enterprise-level organizations, much like older technologies such as floppy discs or ZIP drives that are still supported due to their usage in specific contexts.

I hope this clarifies your concerns.

No case for further DEV investigation for this case.
