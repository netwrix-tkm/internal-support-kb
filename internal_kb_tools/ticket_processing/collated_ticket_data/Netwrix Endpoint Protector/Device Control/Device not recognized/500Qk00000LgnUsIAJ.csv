"500Qk00000LgnUsIAJ","00435237","Support Ticket","SD Cards not being controlled by Endpoint Protector using an Inbuilt SD Card Reader","Good Morning,

A gap in Security has been raised to my attention, where a computer's inbuilt SD Card Reader does not prevent them from using an SD Card.

At present, a user with the EPP Client can use this inbuilt SD Card Reader to plug any SD Card into the computer, to access any files they wish, with read-write permissions. When using an SD Card Reader that is plugged into a USB Port, EPP works as intended and blocks the action. But with the inbuilt SD Card Reader, no blocking action is performed.

This constitutes a concerning lack of security in our systems, as any users who have an inbuilt SD Card reader could have an adversary - Perhaps an on-site contractor walk around, find a laptop that has not been locked and perform any action they wish.

Please could this be investigated?

I am happy to be called or emailed about this Incident.

Kind Regards,
Conor","","SD card reader not being blocked by the EPP Client","A set of logs was collected and an ADO will be opened.

I have to check if we have any plans on controlling the SD cards as we can control the USB Storage device. I will revert to the customer with our plans regarding the SD cards.","The SD Cards can not be controlled as the USB Storage devices are controlled.","","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device not recognized","","","36.0","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","Conor Lane","2025-02-10T11:26:52.000Z","2025-03-18T11:04:56.000Z"
