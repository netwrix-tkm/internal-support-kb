@Cecilia-Maria Iepure I tried to reproduce it with my scanner from Canon but without success, I have the printer with scanner embedded  and they have scanner as stand alone. Looking for that in the office to test. Now my printer with scanner is reported correctly into Unify as network printer.

This issue is related to the problem encountered with the list of devices. Because of a MySQL error, the devices can not be inserted into the server, and they will appear only in the agent console.
This scenario occurs when a computer has specific devices connected, and the agent is installed for the first time on that computer.

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Cecilia-Maria Iepure @Jonathan Micheal Orford we have investigated this one and these are the results:

	 - 	in 710 the scanner is reported in server and client - keep in mind that I used a network printer with scanner incorporated, I don't/QA is not having a scanner as a standalone hardware.
	 - 	On 720 is the same, nothing changed. 

I suggest to wait for 720 to be applied on their side.

Hi Alin,

Based on the discussion with the team, we believe that one of the scenarios which caused the missing logs was causing this issue as well. Internally cannot be reproduced nor on 720 nor on 712 .
Our recommendation is to wait for 7.2.0 release, to be applied and do further investigation afterwards.
In addition, all the team is stretched out due to the 7.2.0 release, which needs to be delivered this month.
