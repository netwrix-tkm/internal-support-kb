Hi Support team, @Stacy Petruzzi @Peter Rooney @WaitingOnEngineer 

This is not a scenario which we support. We do not provide possibility to execute any queries by customer on own, as we don't take support responsibility for it. It require custom approach which is out of regular support. 
If custom additional effort (cost & time dependency on our DEV effort) will be approved, we can offer DEV who can investigate queries simplify requested process.

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

I reached out to Pete and Stacy to see if additional costs would be approved for the custom approach.

However, I think that in the meantime you should inform the customer that we do not support this.

Thank you,
Cristi
