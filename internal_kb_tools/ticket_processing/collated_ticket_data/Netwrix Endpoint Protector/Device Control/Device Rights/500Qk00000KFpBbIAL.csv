"500Qk00000KFpBbIAL","00431185","Support Ticket","support for offline machines","Context:  We have around 100 IoT devices in our Digipass factories (which have no network connectivity) where the current Endpoint device control software running on them retrieve the list of allowed/denied device from a Windows registry file, which has been created on the software server.
Somehow, that registry file contains encrypted values about allowed/denied devices, and these values are decrypted by the software on the client.
If the client can contact the server, pull is done from the client. And vice-versa.
If the client is fully offline, then we can import the registry file even if the client will never contact the server.

So my question is: I would like to know if Netwrix has a possibility to work in an offline mode in the EPP client-server model.","","","","We received confirmation that we can close this ticket after our discussion in a call with Anthony!.","","Adrian Draghici","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","5941","22.1","Closed - Resolved","OneSpan Canada, Inc.","Anthony Nafarrete","2025-01-06T09:45:25.000Z","2025-01-28T11:23:54.000Z"
