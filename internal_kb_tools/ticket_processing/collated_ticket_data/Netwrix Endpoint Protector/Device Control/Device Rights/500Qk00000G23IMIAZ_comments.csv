@Cecilia-Maria Iepure I can see in the logs the SD card reader, they can use the VID/PID and SN from the logs to add a specific device for unblocking it.

after analyzing log file “eppclient.log” the following device has been whitelisted using VID, PID and SN:

Remark:

From my point of view, it makes no sense to whitelist the Internal Card Reader(6) device as well as there are no “DEBUG  enumerate” listed in the logs for this device.

Does this consideration make sense?

Result:

    According to the affected user, using SD card now works.
    After connecting the SD card is unblocked.
    Log files of the SD card connection process are still not available on the server console.


Thank you for the workaround!

Please still analyze and check, why SD cards are not listed in EPP client console and why there are no logs from connected SD cards on the server console.","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2024-10-15T12:42:50.000Z","2024-10-15T12:42:50.000Z","false","false"

@Cecilia-Maria Iepure it seems that devices are having a delay to enter the server - 5 minutes probably; in my case I had the option to test with an external SD card reader and it appeared in Unify server and also in EPP Client. In this case, we cannot reproduce the issue because everything is working as expected at our end.

Hi Alin,

Our recommendation is to wait for 7.2.0 release, to be applied and do further investigation afterwards.

In addition, all the team is stretched out due to the 7.2.0 release, which needs to be delivered this month.

The customer has reported that the testing has been carried out.

 Initial situation:

- User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
- The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
- The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
- There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.
 

Expectation:

- After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”
- The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
- The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
- Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.
 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

- The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
- The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
- There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.
 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

I have tested with 2 external card readers, one that is generic, and one from Dlink, both function as expected,, and the SD Card can be blocked/unblocked without issues. Tested using the internal SD Card reader, the device works as expected ( the device is of type SCSI ). 

Is the Card reader ( not clear if internal or external ) properly identified? ( SCSI, MTD, or Internal).

We investigated this issue at BMW, to see how the rights look on unify and nodes and we could not see differences, we need a connection with the client in order to test this scenario together.

We were connected and found out that the problem was that an SD card was allowed when the rights were set to deny. This was because the connection between the unify and nodes was not done correctly and when the right was deleted from unify it couldn't be deleted from nodes. We made the connection ok, so all the modifications made after to be executed ok and we deleted the right from the nodes, that was deleted on unify server.
After the modification took place ok, they wanted to self remediate but they expected the self remediate popup to show automatically, which it did not. They said that this ticket could be closed and open a new ticket for the behavior of the self remediate poupup.

Please see the customer's reply below, and respond to their points in order for us to be able to close this:

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:

- The SD card reader is blocked again.
- Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.
 

Attention:

- After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self “Remediate” pop-up window appears for manual approval.
- The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
- Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.
 

Please briefly summarize the following again:

- What was the cause of the problem?
- How was it resolved?
- How can it be prevented in the future?
 
The ticket can then be closed.

Thank you!","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-04-04T11:45:14.000Z","2025-04-04T11:45:14.000Z","false","false"

Hi @Alin Anca
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the unify console also from the nodes.
 
- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more..if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again...because it might be a communication error due to load...

a few comments/questions on point 3: How can it be prevented in the future?

 - No rights were added here! Only a single global right was removed on the Unify server.
So, my question:
How can Netwrix ensure that removing and adding a global right definitely works?
- “If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration”
How can actually be checked whether added rights are being taken into consideration?
Usually, after adding a global right, the affected user is checked to see whether, for example, access is functional.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-04-09T12:45:33.000Z","2025-04-09T12:45:33.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer @Cecilia-Maria Iepure @Alin Anca One solution to verify this issue, in case there is a suspicion it might still occur, would be to reuse the same device on two different endpoints to see if the behavior is consistent and if the global rights are at fault. 
As to prevention, currently we consider this occurrence to have been remote with very low probability of it happening again in the future.
