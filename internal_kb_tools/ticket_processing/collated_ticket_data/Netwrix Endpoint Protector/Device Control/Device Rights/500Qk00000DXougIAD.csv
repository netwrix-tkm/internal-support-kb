"500Qk00000DXougIAD","00416114","Support Ticket","need to delete all computers","We have changed our device exception model from device and computer based to user based, and need to delete all the device permissions set on all the computers. We think the easiest way to do this is to delete all the computers and let them get recreated when they check back in. Deleting them through the gui is quite painful and usually fails when we select a large number. Can we get support to get into the database and delete them directly from the database?","","","","Manually removed by customer.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","32.0","Closed - Resolved","Chevron Phillips Chemical","Jeff Schemp","2024-07-25T15:41:52.000Z","2024-08-26T15:36:22.000Z"
