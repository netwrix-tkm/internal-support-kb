Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we unfortunately do not store on the EPP server the Hardware ID's of the devices(USB's).

If you would like this functionality to be implemented in future releases, please raise a separate ticket for a Feature Request. Please provide us with all the details needed and some examples of use cases. Once we receive the Feature Request we will raise it with our Product Team and they will analyze it and see if it can be implemented in future versions.

We are closing this ticket.
