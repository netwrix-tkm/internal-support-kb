I have checked our repository and it seems that we have had a few tickets regarding Audio Device issues.

These were mostly resolved by upgrading to the latest EPP server version and client version. Can you please confirm if you are running the latest EPP client version and server version?

I believe upgrading these(EPP server and clients to the latest version) should resolve the issue.

Please let me know if we can schedule a remote session for tomorrow or any day next week and we will take a look together.

We would need access to a computer that experiences this issue in order to test.

We might have to remove the latest EPP client version and try with an older/previous version to see if the issue still persists then, to determine if it is a client or server related issue.
