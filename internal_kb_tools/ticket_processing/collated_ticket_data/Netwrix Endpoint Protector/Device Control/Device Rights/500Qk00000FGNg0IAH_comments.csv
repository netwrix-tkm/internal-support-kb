I had another remote with the customer, this time the issue was a bit different.
The client wasn't communicating with the server, it showed up as offline and unlicensed on the console, but the client showed that it is communicating(attached screenshot).
We also added the DPI certificate to the keychain, but it didn't show up on the client.
I added the logs and the screenshot to the 419872_2 folder:

@WaitingOnEngineer According to the 6th September log there was a communication problem: the client received a certificate from the server, but in the subsequent steps the server did not acknowledged it. This is probably a server issue. The second, 10th September log shows that the client is communicating with the server, but there is no DPI certificate.

Regarding the client versions, they seem to be OK. One of the log file starts with 3.0.2.1007, the corresponding screenshot also shows 3.0.2.1007. The other log reports version 3.0.1.2002, the screenshot also shows 3.0.1.2002.

Do you have any recommendations for the september 6th issue? For the other one we can re-add the certificate to the keychain to see if that makes a difference.

Hi Botond, without digging further into the problem I can not suggest any solution for the September 6th issue. We think this belongs to the server team, and Cristi will move the issue there.

Hi,



It is very difficult to follow the issue and the attachments in this case , so please make a new test on one of the affected computers.

Please check that the firewall is not blocking the communication of that computer with the server.
 
 telnet <IP> <PORT>

Also, for testing purposes, please disable the DPI certificate for the computer that you are testing with.

Follow these steps:

1. Enable registration logs:
     

--- CODE ---
    vim /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php
--- CODE ---

    set DEBUG to true and DEBUG_VERBOSITY to 1011 and save the file

   2. Reregister the machine:


--- CODE ---
        select id from clientmachine where name = 'machine_name';
--- CODE ---

                                  - this will provide the machine_id


--- CODE ---
        UPDATE license SET assigned_to = null where assigned_to = machine_id;
        UPDATE clientmachine SET trialversion = NULL, reregister = 1 WHERE id = machine_id;
        DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;
--- CODE ---

      3.  Update Policies

       4. Provide the logs from /EPPServer/sieratool/log/WebServiceFree.log

       5.  Very important: Disable the debug from point 1


        6. Collect  client logs during this test.

    Please let us know if there are multiple computers that are affected by this issue.

Thank you,
Alina
