Ticket Number: 00437078
Ticket Subject: iphone USB connect allowed
Ticket Details: WE have the setting set to allow for power only when an iPhone is connected, but when trying it out recently we have found that when an iPhone is connected it allows you to browse the storage of the USB, this is restricted to the camera roll, but does allow a user to download files from an iPhone to the PC. We need to stop this but still allow charging for iPhones,

Thank you!

Marian Ilies
Technical Support Engineer
