This is Jessica from Qast. I submit this ticket on behalf of Huawei, and I prefer Adrian to handle this ticket, who is always in charge of Huawei's case. 

Their version information:
Server Version: 5.9.3.0
Client Version: 2.5.0.8 (I suppose the cause is due to this old version)
Client OS: Mac Sonoma 14.74 (Mac mini), Sonoma 14.7.4 (iMAC)

Problem Description:
The policy set in Device Control is disabling WiFi and Bluetooth (Deny Access) in Computer level, and the computer right prior to the user right. This policy is effective and WiFi is disabled automatically.

But users can enable WiFi manually on Mac and connect to the network. 

This problem is very urgent. Please help the customer solve the problem. Thanks a lot in advance. ","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-13T08:28:00.000Z"
