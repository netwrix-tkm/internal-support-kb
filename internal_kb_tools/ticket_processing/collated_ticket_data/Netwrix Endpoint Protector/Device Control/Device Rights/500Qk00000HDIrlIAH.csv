"500Qk00000HDIrlIAH","00424426","Support Ticket","Devices detected/seen on the EPP client are different than the ones seen on the EPP server as connected.","The issue that remains is that in the EPP client UI of the computers the list of devices is different than the one on the EPP server when searching in Device Control -> Devices -> Filter after Computer name. I have attached some screenshots with the comparison between the two(Client UI vs what is seen on the server). There are missing devices and extra devices in both the displays that do not match one with the other.

I am also attaching logs for this computer where we checked.
Location: 

Please advise.

Thank you!

Scheduled a new meeting for next week to check if any duplicate ones appear until then.
03Feb: Scheduled remote session to apply steps from R&D.
Waiting on R&D to provide instructions.","Closing ticket.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","125.9","Closed - Resolved","Children's Medical Center of Dallas - Auditor","WILLIAM LAU","2024-10-18T17:00:09.000Z","2025-02-21T15:43:08.000Z"
