Good Afternoon, Iosif

Does the fact the current system we have been working on is in the (Cloud) or should I say it's an Intune Device have any effect as why the permissions are not taking effect. The server is Domain Joined.

Hi Vannick,

As discussed in our meeting today, please update the EPP server to the latest version(5.9.4.1), and after that, you can upgrade the EPP clients also(it can be done from the EPP UI: System Configuration->Client Software Upgrade, or using MDM tools).

If after the upgrade the printer issue persists, we will collect the logs again and send them to the R&D for further investigations.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick,

Yes, it is always recommended that we update both server and clients to the latest version, as it includes many improvements and bug fixes.
So if it is possible, please update them, and if the issue persists we are going to collect the logs with the latest client installed.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick, Carlos,

Do you think it is feasible for you to upgrade the EPP Server to the 5.9.4.0 version? We can share with you a newer EPP Client to test it in combination with the new server version.

Otherwise, we can try with the current server version and the new client, and in case the issue persists we will schedule a remote session to collect some logs.

Which option works best for you?

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out.

Is it possible to check if any specific settings/client or server updates were made before this issue occurred?
Are there other computers with custom device rights affected also?

Please provide the EPP Server and EPP Client version you are currently using.

Did you manage to update the EPP Server and EPP agent to the latest versions?

Hi Vannick,

As discussed in our meeting today, please update the EPP server to the latest version(5.9.4.1), and after that, you can upgrade the EPP clients also(it can be done from the EPP UI: System Configuration->Client Software Upgrade, or using MDM tools).

If after the upgrade the printer issue persists, we will collect the logs again and send them to the R&D for further investigations.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick,

Yes, it is always recommended that we update both server and clients to the latest version, as it includes many improvements and bug fixes.
So if it is possible, please update them, and if the issue persists we are going to collect the logs with the latest client installed.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick, Carlos,

Do you think it is feasible for you to upgrade the EPP Server to the 5.9.4.0 version? We can share with you a newer EPP Client to test it in combination with the new server version.

Otherwise, we can try with the current server version and the new client, and in case the issue persists we will schedule a remote session to collect some logs.

Which option works best for you?

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out.

Is it possible to check if any specific settings/client or server updates were made before this issue occurred?
Are there other computers with custom device rights affected also?

Please provide the EPP Server and EPP Client version you are currently using.

Hi Vannick,

Please correct me if I'm wrong, the computer/server where the EPP agent is installed is a device managed by Intune, it's also Domain joined. This should not generate any issues.

Did you manage to update the EPP Server and EPP agent to the latest versions?
Thank you!

Good Afternoon, Iosif

Does the fact the current system we have been working on is in the (Cloud) or should I say it's an Intune Device have any effect as why the permissions are not taking effect. The server is Domain Joined.

Hi Vannick,

As discussed in our meeting today, please update the EPP server to the latest version(5.9.4.1), and after that, you can upgrade the EPP clients also(it can be done from the EPP UI: System Configuration->Client Software Upgrade, or using MDM tools).

If after the upgrade the printer issue persists, we will collect the logs again and send them to the R&D for further investigations.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick,

Yes, it is always recommended that we update both server and clients to the latest version, as it includes many improvements and bug fixes.
So if it is possible, please update them, and if the issue persists we are going to collect the logs with the latest client installed.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick, Carlos,

Do you think it is feasible for you to upgrade the EPP Server to the 5.9.4.0 version? We can share with you a newer EPP Client to test it in combination with the new server version.

Otherwise, we can try with the current server version and the new client, and in case the issue persists we will schedule a remote session to collect some logs.

Which option works best for you?

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out.

Is it possible to check if any specific settings/client or server updates were made before this issue occurred?
Are there other computers with custom device rights affected also?

Please provide the EPP Server and EPP Client version you are currently using.

Hi Vannick,

Please correct me if I'm wrong, the computer/server where the EPP agent is installed is a device managed by Intune, it's also Domain joined. This should not generate any issues.

Did you manage to update the EPP Server and EPP agent to the latest versions?
Thank you!

Good Afternoon, Iosif

 

Does the fact the current system we have been working on is in the (Cloud) or should I say it’s an Intune Device have any effect as why the permissions are not taking effect. The server is Domain Joined.

Hi Vannick,

As discussed in our meeting today, please update the EPP server to the latest version(5.9.4.1), and after that, you can upgrade the EPP clients also(it can be done from the EPP UI: System Configuration->Client Software Upgrade, or using MDM tools).

If after the upgrade the printer issue persists, we will collect the logs again and send them to the R&D for further investigations.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick,

Yes, it is always recommended that we update both server and clients to the latest version, as it includes many improvements and bug fixes.
So if it is possible, please update them, and if the issue persists we are going to collect the logs with the latest client installed.

Thank you!

Hi Vannick, Carlos,

Do you think it is feasible for you to upgrade the EPP Server to the 5.9.4.0 version? We can share with you a newer EPP Client to test it in combination with the new server version.

Otherwise, we can try with the current server version and the new client, and in case the issue persists we will schedule a remote session to collect some logs.

Which option works best for you?

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out.

Is it possible to check if any specific settings/client or server updates were made before this issue occurred?
Are there other computers with custom device rights affected also?

Please provide the EPP Server and EPP Client version you are currently using.
