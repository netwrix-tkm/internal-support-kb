@WaitingOnEngineer

The ""NoUser"" username appears usually when there is no user logged at the machine. For example, if one restarts a machine, the Login screen appears, but no one logs at the machine, it is normal to have no user. I checked the logs and indeed, the client does not detect any user logged at the moment the logs were collected. Moreover, the tasklist that is exported shows no real user logged, the processes that are running have as owner the System. So, long story short, this is pretty much expected. Or was expected, because to my knowledge, in 5941 we introduced some logic that will keep and use the last known logged user when there is no user logged at the machine. I see the customer uses a 5940 build, so you can advise to upgrade.Â
