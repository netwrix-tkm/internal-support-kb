Just a quick question, if you don't mind?

My team and I have noticed an account called 'NoUser' within Device Control -> Users that appears to be checking in every minute, across all devices within the company, such that if you search for that user and refresh the search, the ""last computer"" field changes every time.

Is this normal?

If so, is there any available explanation as to what this noUser account is? Can we remove it without causing any impact? I notice that it has the groups set as ""Allow All"" which is the only example of this within the company.

Many Thanks,
Conor","","The customer reported that for some computers the EPP Client is reporting ""NoUser"" for the logged user.

R&D concluded that this is an expected behavior, and advised to upgrade the server and clients to the latest versions that include improved noUser logging.

We informed the customer about the R&D findings.","The customer collected a set of logs and I attached them to the ADO.
Waiting for an update from R&D.

Waiting for the customer's feedback.","The ""NoUser"" username appears usually when there is no user logged in to the machine. For example, if one restarts a machine, the Login screen appears, but no one logs at the machine, it is normal to have no user. 
The engineers checked the logs and indeed, the EPP client did not detect any user logged at the moment the logs were collected. Moreover, the tasklist that is exported shows no real user logged, the processes that are running have as owner the System.","","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","47.1","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","Conor Lane","2025-02-28T12:06:39.000Z","2025-04-16T14:26:12.000Z"
