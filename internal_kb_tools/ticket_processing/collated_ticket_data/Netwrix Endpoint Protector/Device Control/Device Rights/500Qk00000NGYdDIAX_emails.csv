I hope you are well.
We investigated and found out that one node had different right that the one saved on the unify console. We modified it and now it should work ok.
Please check and let us know if we can close this ticket after that.

Hello,



fyi:

This email I did not receive as well:

[cid:image001.png@01DB9F01.BB128B60]



An update regarding this case:

According to the customer, Bluetooth other device types are blocked again as expected due to the global rights setting.

[cid:image002.png@01DB9F09.B2BF5FD0]


This raises the following questions:

  1.  What was the reason why the Bluetooth other devices were no longer blocked?
  2.  How was the problem resolved now?
  3.  How can external devices be prevented from suddenly no longer being blocked on a computer in the future, even though they should be blocked due to global rights?

Thanks for answering the questions in advance.





Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

one answer to my questions is missing:
How can external devices be prevented from suddenly no longer being blocked on a computer in the future, even though they should be blocked due to global rights?

More specifically:

  *   How can you prevent that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console?
  *   How could something like this even happen?

Thank you for your reply.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

I hope you are well.
We have received an update regarding your remaining queries on this topic, please see below:

Root Cause:

The discrepancy arose due to an inconsistency between the global rights set on the Unify console and the device-level settings. While the global rights were correctly configured to ""Deny Access,"" the settings on the affected node permitted access, which caused the unintended behavior.

Resolution:

Our team has realigned the node settings with the Unify console to ensure consistent application of the Bluetooth device blocking policies. We have also advised our technical team to enhance monitoring processes to detect and prevent similar inconsistencies in the future.

To ensure sustained functionality, we recommend the following:

Periodic Validation: Regularly review and validate global rights settings and ensure they are effectively propagated across all nodes and devices.

Updated Procedures: In case of any future discrepancies, trying a reset by toggling the settings off and on, or removing and re-adding specific devices that seem affected, can help in re-establishing intended configurations.

Thank you,
Best regards,
Alin Anca

  *   Which steps must be carried out?

Hello,



UPDATE



Fyi:

This email I did not receive as well:

[cid:image003.png@01DBA7A4.E7344840]



According to the customer, Bluetooth other device types are blocked again as expected due to the global rights setting.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA7A4.E7344840]


More specifically asked:

  1.  How can you prevent that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console?
  2.  How could something like this even happen?

Thank you for your reply.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
We investigated and found out that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console. We modified it and now it should work ok.
Please check and let us know if we can close this ticket after that.

The engineering team has concluded on the latest queries that you added, please see below:

We have reviewed the behavior internally and for our future releases we believe this behavior will not happen again. The next release, 7.3.0 contains a full upgrade of PHP, MySQL and Symphony framework. Along with these upgrades, we have made improvements regarding communication between components (as a mandatory operation part of the upgrade) and we do not expect this issue to resurface.

  *   How can it be reviewed and ensured from the operational side (WK IT) that global rights settings are effectively propagated to all nodes and devices?
  *   Which steps must be carried out?
  *   Can this even be done by the Operations Team (WK IT)?

About the regular validations, what engineering suggested, is to have a manual verification of the global settings, and that a setting in a group, computer/user or device level does not supersede it.
Just make sure the device does not have a different setting than the global or group settings that you want to apply.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hello,

I hope you are well.
We investigated and found out that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console. We modified it and now it should work ok.
Please check and let us know if we can close this ticket after that.

Thank you,
Best regards,

Hello,

for your information:
Before a ticket is opened, it is always checked whether local settings supersede a global one.

Notes:

  *   If I have understood the problem that has arisen correctly, a comparison of local and global settings is of little use. The problem only arose after a local setting was deleted and therefore the global setting should actually be adopted.
  *   Checking the settings on the affected node is not possible. The settings can be checked on affected computers.
  *   It is also not possible to check the local settings on 120.000 computers as a regularly review and validate.
  *   A reset by toggling the settings off and on, or removing and re-adding specific devices that seem affected, is not feasible, as only a local setting was removed in this case.

Please take note of the comments and check for any further information regarding ""regular validations"" and share it.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hi Christian,

About the regular validations, what engineering suggested, is to have a manual verification of the global settings, and that a setting in a group, computer/user or device level does not supersede it.
Just make sure the device does not have a different setting than the global or group settings that you want to apply.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hello,

thank you for the explanation.

However, the questions asked were related to your statement about ""Regular validation"":

  1.  How can it be reviewed and ensured from the operational side (WK IT) that global rights settings are effectively propagated to all nodes and devices?
  2.  Which steps must be carried out?
  3.  Can this even be done by the Operations Team (WK IT)?

Please let me know.
Thank you.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
The engineering team has concluded on the latest queries that you added, please see below:

We have reviewed the behavior internally and for our future releases we believe this behavior will not happen again. The next release, 7.3.0 contains a full upgrade of PHP, MySQL and Symphony framework. Along with these upgrades, we have made improvements regarding communication between components (as a mandatory operation part of the upgrade) and we do not expect this issue to resurface.

Thank you,

According to the customer, Bluetooth other device types are blocked again as expected due to the global rights setting.

More specifically asked:

  1.  How can you prevent that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console?
  2.  How could something like this even happen?

If I have understood the problem that has arisen correctly, a comparison of local and global settings is of little use. The problem only arose after a local setting was deleted and therefore the global setting should actually be adopted.
If a local setting is deleted, the computer is still of a custom type in the computers list, so Global will not apply unless the computer is restored to global settings. That is done by editing the settings of the computer, and ""restore global settings"" at the bottom of the page. The same applies to Rights.

Checking the settings on the affected node is not possible. The settings can be checked on affected computers.
Correct, as the node itself cannot be checked, but the affected computers can be checked.

It is also not possible to check the local settings on 120.000 computers as a regularly review and validate.
I understand that, but when there are affected computers, this should be checked. Since you have such a large environment, to make the check easier, you can go to the computers page and sort by the settings, then rights columns and see if there are any of Custom type. Those will not switch to global rights or settings unless restored.


A reset by toggling the settings off and on, or removing and re-adding specific devices that seem affected, is not feasible, as only a local setting was removed in this case
Not sure what you mean, but if the setting was removed on the computer directly, then it will have custom settings.

Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
