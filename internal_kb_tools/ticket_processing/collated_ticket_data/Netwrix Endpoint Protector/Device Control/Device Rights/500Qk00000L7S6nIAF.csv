"500Qk00000L7S6nIAF","00433700","Support Ticket","Phone Read Only behavior changed","We have received reports of User's phones no longer being Read Only when connected to computers with EPP installed.  After some investigating, it looks like this started on December 20th, the same day we pushed out the server/client updates to 5.9.4.1 and 6.2.4.1 respectively.  

When I search EPP for Unblocked Iphone events, I still find some.  When I look at the client version these are running, I have not found one running 6.2.4.1, so this may be an issue/change with the new client for iPhones (Seeing unblocked on client 6.2.3.1).  For Android, the most recent Unblock event I see is on December 20th, about the time we updated the server, so this appears to be an issue/change with the server update for Android.

When I checked the Global Rights in the EPP console, for Android Smartphone (Media Transfer Protocol) there is only Deny Access and Allow Access, no options for Read Only.  For iPhone it's the same with the addition of Deny Access but Allow Charging.

I've included screenshots of the same device on the same computer, being unblocked, then a few hours later it shows blocked (I assume the client updated in this time)

1. Was there a change to how iphones/android phones are handled by EPP with the latest server and client updates?  I've looked at the patch notes and the bug fixes online, but wasn't able to find anything relevant to this situation.

2. What configuration changes can we make to restore functionality to the way it behaved previously?  (Android and iPhones being treated as Read Only instead of fully blocked)","","the customer wants to know why the ""read only"" right disappeared from ios and android devices
asked internally","waiting on internal information to pass over to the customer","let the customer know that we didn't have a read only mode","","Botond Biro","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","4.2","Closed - Resolved","OUHSC","Chisum Thompson","2025-01-27T15:22:37.000Z","2025-01-31T20:45:58.000Z"
