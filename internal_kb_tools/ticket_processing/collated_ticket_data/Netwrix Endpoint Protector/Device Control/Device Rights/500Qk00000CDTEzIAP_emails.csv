I tried a callback as requested but the call did not go through, so I am replying via the ticket.
There could be multiple reasons why the page keeps on loading.
One of them is the very high number of logs on the server where an audit log should help if set up.
Another one could be high resource usage based on client-server activity, which will resolve after the task is done.
Disk space issues could also cause high loading times.
Seeing that I do not know which one is the cause, I recommend setting up a remote session where we can troubleshoot.
I will need SSH access to the server, so please make sure it can be accessed by the time we set it up.
Please let me know your timezone and availability for a remote session.

Thank you,
