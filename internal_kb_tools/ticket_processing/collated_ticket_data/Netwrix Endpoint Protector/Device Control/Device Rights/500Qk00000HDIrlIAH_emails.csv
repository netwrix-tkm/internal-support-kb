Hi Flaviu,

I installed on one endpoint. Before the installation, I only see less than 20 entries in the console on that computer. After the installation, it is showing more than 5K entries in the devices on that computer. Not good at all.

Hi Flaviu,

I installed on one endpoint. Before the installation, I only see less than 20 entries in the console on that computer. After the installation, it is showing more than 5K entries in the devices on that computer. Not good at all.

Thanks,
Will

Hi William,

We were asked by our devs to raise the device miss match between the EPP server and the EPP client in a separate ticket.

We have raised this ticket to address that issue. I will get back to you as soon as I have more updates on this.

Hi William,

Please let me know if you have availability this week or next week for a remote session so we can take a look at the issue. We would need access to the computer where the agent was installed and caused it to have 5k entries in the list.

Thank you for the remote session!

I will check to see if we can identify the device type codes/ids for the rest of the devices so we can try and delete them.

In the meantime please check to see if the end user will have availability for a remote session so we can generate logs on that computer. I can also send the steps to generate log files if needed.
