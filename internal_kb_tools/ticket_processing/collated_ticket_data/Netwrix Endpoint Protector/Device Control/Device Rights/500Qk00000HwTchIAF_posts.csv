This issue is particularly concerning as it had worked in their EPP testing instance.

Despite our testing, we found that enabling the “Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1+” setting does not allow users to read pre-existing files on the USB device.

Below are the client’s comments and test scenario to replicate the issue:
1.	Data was copied onto the USB using a personal laptop.
2.	The USB was then plugged into a work computer, where Easy Lock launched, and the drive was password protected. A work document was copied and encrypted successfully.
3.	However, the personal document already on the USB could not be viewed on the work computer, as Windows would not open the drive through File Explorer.
4.	When the USB was plugged into a personal desktop computer, the unencrypted file could be accessed, and the work-related content could be decrypted.

We would appreciate your prompt support in resolving this issue, as it is critical for our client’s operations. Please advise on the necessary steps or configurations required to enable access to existing data on USB drives.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your swift response.","","","","0050g000005zo5JAAQ","2024-11-06T05:35:38.000Z"
