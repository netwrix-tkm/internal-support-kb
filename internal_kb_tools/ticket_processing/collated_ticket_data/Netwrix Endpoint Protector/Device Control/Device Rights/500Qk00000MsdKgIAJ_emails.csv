We tested inhouse with the latest client available in Server version 5941  - Client 3.0.4.1006 and it does not reproduces for us.
When we tried to activate the Wi-fi from the toggle button it gets automatically deactivated after 1 second. Attaching a screenshot.
I am also sending you in advance the latest client download link so that Huawei can test it prior to the server + client upgradation.

Ticket Number: 00438657
Ticket Subject: Users CaUsers Can Still Enable Wifi Manually on MAC While 
Wifi Is Disabled (from HUAWEI）
Ticket Details: Dear Sir/Madam,

This is Jessica from Qast. I submit this ticket on behalf of Huawei, and I 
prefer Adrian to handle this ticket, who is always in charge of Huawei's 
case. 

Their version information:
Server Version: 5.9.3.0
Client Version: 2.5.0.8 (I suppose the cause is due to this old version)
Client OS: Mac Sonoma 14.74 (Mac mini), Sonoma 14.7.4 (iMAC)

Problem Description:
The policy set in Device Control is disabling WiFi and Bluetooth (Deny 
Access) in Computer level, and the computer right prior to the user right. 
This policy is effective and WiFi is disabled automatically.

But users can enable WiFi manually on Mac and connect to the network. 

This problem is very urgent. Please help the customer solve the problem. 
Thanks a lot in advance. 

Thank you!

Adrian Draghici
Technical Support Team Lead
