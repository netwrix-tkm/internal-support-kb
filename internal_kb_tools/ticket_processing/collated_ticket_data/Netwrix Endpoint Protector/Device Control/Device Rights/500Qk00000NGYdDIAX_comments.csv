Hello
Based on the client logs provided the right for bluetooth other (device type id 43) is set to allow.

Make sure that the right for bluetooth is set to deny access based on their right priority setup. If right is set to deny but the EPP client is still allowing the device, we need to have a look in their database.

Checked locally with a few different bluetooth devices and could not reproduce this specific scenario.

We investigated and found out that one node had different right that the one saved on the unify console. We modified it and now it should work ok.

According to the customer, Bluetooth other device types are blocked again as expected due to the global rights setting.

More specifically asked:

- How can you prevent that one node had different right that the one saved on the Unify console?
- How could something like this even happen?","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-27T13:26:12.000Z","2025-03-27T13:26:12.000Z","false","false"

Root Cause:

The discrepancy arose due to an inconsistency between the global rights set on the Unify console and the device-level settings. While the global rights were correctly configured to ""Deny Access,"" the settings on the affected node permitted access, which caused the unintended behavior.

 

Resolution:

Our team has realigned the node settings with the Unify console to ensure consistent application of the Bluetooth device blocking policies. We have also advised our technical team to enhance monitoring processes to detect and prevent similar inconsistencies in the future.

 

To ensure sustained functionality, we recommend the following:

 

Periodic Validation: Regularly review and validate global rights settings and ensure they are effectively propagated across all nodes and devices.

Updated Procedures: In case of any future discrepancies, trying a reset by toggling the settings off and on, or removing and re-adding specific devices that seem affected, can help in re-establishing intended configurations.

@WaitingOnEngineer @Cecilia-Maria Iepure We have reviewed the behavior internally and for our future releases we believe this behavior will not happen again. The next release, 7.3.0 contains a full upgrade of PHP, MySQL and Symphony framework. Along with these upgrades, we have made improvements regarding communication between components  (as a mandatory operation part of the upgrade) and we do not expect this issue to resurface.
