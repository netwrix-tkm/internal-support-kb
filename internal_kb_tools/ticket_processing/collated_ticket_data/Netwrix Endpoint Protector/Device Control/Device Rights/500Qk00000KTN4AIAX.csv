"500Qk00000KTN4AIAX","00431756","Support Ticket","IDT-CYJ0PZ3 - Zebra ZP 450-200 dpi","This machine has a device allow for a zebra zp printer.  I allowed this device in EPP a few weeks ago and everything was fine.  Beginning this week, we notice that the devices appear to be green in epp on the client, but epp is still blocking the printer.","","We have asked for additional details about the reported issue.

We have provided the latest windows eppclient version but the issue is still reproducing.

We had a remote session with the customer where we recreate the allowing rule for the specified printing device. Unfortunately the end-user didn't manage to join and they will let us know about the outcome of the changes we have made.

The changes from the previous remote sessions have fixed the issue.

We had another remote session with the customer to investigate the zebra printer issues on another computer. We could not download the support tool and we have attached it to the ticket, including the necessary steps for log collecting.

We have opened an escalation ticket for R&D to investigate.

We have provided the build received from R&D to the customer for testing and recommended them to always be on the latest Server and Client version to avoid known issues.

The printer issue can be reproduced with the provided eppclient and we advised the customer to upgrade the server and the client to the latest versions available.","We are waiting for the customer's reply.

We are going to schedule a remote session to investigate the issue and collect the logs

We are waiting for the end-user to retest and confirm if the issue was solved or not.

The customer wants a few days to monitor if our fix is permanent, so we will do a follow-up next week.

We are waiting for the customer to collect the logs and attach them here for further investigation.

We are waiting for the R&D solution.

We are waiting for the customer's confirmation on the new client build.

If the printer issue persists after the server&client upgrade, we will schedule another remote session to collect the logs for R&D.","This issue has been resolved by applying the latest server and client updates.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","70.1","Closed - Resolved","NationsBenefits","Carlos Miyares","2025-01-10T18:28:08.000Z","2025-03-21T21:04:33.000Z"
