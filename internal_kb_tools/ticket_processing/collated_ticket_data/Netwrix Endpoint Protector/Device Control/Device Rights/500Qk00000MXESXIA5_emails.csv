Thank you for your time today during our meeting.
As you mentioned that only one user is affected by this, and only in South Africa, with a previous version of the client, please let me know after you managed to test this with the latest client and see if all the communications are working well for him and if he's receiving the policies.

Hello,

fyi:
This email I did not receive as well:

[cid:image001.png@01DB9D73.BA59F8A0]



The next step was to test the following:

  1.  Computer offline: No Internet connection!
Testing approval with correct login credentials.
  2.  Computer online: Internet connection with BMW network!
Testing unblocking with incorrect and correct login credentials.



Hint:

No tests can be carried out at the moment, as external USB storage devices are not blocked on the user's affected computer.

Hello,

fyi:
This email I did not receive as well:
[cid:image001.png@01DBAECC.5EC28790]

A few more questions and a request...


  *   Were the log files actually compared as described in email from Fri, April 4, 2025, 3:37 PM?
--> see below.
  *   Were no differences found?

Therefore, my request:
Compare the log files (epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip) that were recorded during the outage in South Africa again with those from the last tests (LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip / LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip).
Perhaps some errors can be found here.

Please let me know the result.
Thank you.

The next step was to test the following:

  2.  Computer online: Internet connection with BMW network!
Testing unblocking with incorrect and correct login credentials.



Hint:

No tests can be carried out at the moment, as external USB storage devices are not blocked on the user's affected computer.

Betreff: AW: Netwrix Support Ticket #00437623 - Unblocking devices offline not possible - ref:_00D7000000091pB._500Qk00000MXESX:ref

Hello,

fyi:
This email I did not receive as well:

[cid:image003.png@01DBAF89.2C9E6500]



The next step was to test the following:

  1.  Computer offline: No Internet connection!
Testing approval with correct login credentials.
  2.  Computer online: Internet connection with BMW network!
Testing unblocking with incorrect and correct login credentials.



Hint:

No tests can be carried out at the moment, as external USB storage devices are not blocked on the user's affected computer.

--> see vendor case 438964.





Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

I hope you are well.
My colleagues have prepared a test build for Windows, please use the following link to download the build:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp29042025/EPPClientSetup.6.2.5.0010.zip
As this is a test build, please install it only on 2-3 computers to confirm it works and let us know the results after that.
In the case that the issue is still present, please provide us with the log files collected during the replication of the scenario with the test build installed.

Hello,

 

it works as it should, correct.

 

But my request is the following:

Please compare the log files (epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip) that were recorded during the outage in South Africa with those from the last tests (LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip / LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip).

Maybe some errors can be found here.

 

If it is already done, please let me know the result.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I am confused as per your previous reply, you mentioned:

The following tests have been done: 


	Computer is online: Internet and BMW network connection! 

	
		Testing approval with incorrect login credentials.
		Testing approval with correct login credentials.
	
	


--> see log files “LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip” uploaded to vendor website. 


	Computer is offline: No Internet connection! 

	
		Testing unblocking with incorrect login credentials.
		Testing unblocking with correct login credentials.
	
	


--> see log files “LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip” uploaded to vendor website.
 
Result:
All tests were successful and worked as expected. User was always able to unblock the external connected device.

Is it not working as it should?

Hello,

 

fyi:

A few more questions and a request…

 


	Were the log files actually compared as described in email from Fri, April 4, 2025, 3:37 PM?
	--> see below.
	Were no differences found?


 

Therefore, my request:

Compare the log files (epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip) that were recorded during the outage in South Africa again with those from the last tests (LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip / LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip).

Hello,

as mentioned in the ticket description, the problem only occurs when the user is in South Africa. This makes testing a bit more difficult, as it has to be waited until the user is back in South Africa.
The user has been contacted with the intention of installing the test build once he returns to South Africa for business.

For this reason, please be patient. Currently, we cannot estimate when testing will be possible.
Thank you for your understanding.

Result:
All tests were successful and worked as expected. User was always able to unblock the external connected device.

Please compare the new logs with the logs ""epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip""  where offline unblocking does not work.

Hint:
User said that offline approval only stopped working after a few days. Please include this statement in your considerations.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Betreff: AW: Netwrix Support Ticket #00437623 - Unblocking devices offline not possible - ref:_00D7000000091pB._500Qk00000MXESX:ref

Hello,

fyi:
This email I did not receive as well:

[cid:image003.png@01DBB9C2.9F508590]



The next step was to test the following:

  1.  Computer offline: No Internet connection!
Testing approval with correct login credentials.
  2.  Computer online: Internet connection with BMW network!
Testing unblocking with incorrect and correct login credentials.



Hint:

No tests can be carried out at the moment, as external USB storage devices are not blocked on the user's affected computer.

--> see vendor case 438964.





Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards
