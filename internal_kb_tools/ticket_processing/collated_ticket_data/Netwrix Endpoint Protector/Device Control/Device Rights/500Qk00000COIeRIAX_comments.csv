Hi @Flaviu Moldovan

I hope you are well.

The issue has been tracked under https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/345259.
Currently, there is a fix in place which is already available, and also, back end procedure #62 from this Google Doc, explains how this fix can be manually applied.

I hope this helps.

Please let me know if I can further assist.

Regards,
Cristi

@Flaviu Moldovan in this case, I think the problem is not related to the vulnerability patch. 
It's more related to the devices and rights set at the group level. 
In the last weeks, two more issues were raised regarding the device rights set at the group level after upgrading the server to 5.9.3.0.

In this case, please follow the procedure from this ticket #340075

@Flaviu Moldovan ,
when the vulnerability patch was applied, was the server already at version 5.9.3.0 or was the server running a lower version, and it was upgraded to 5.9.3.0?

Have you checked if CAP logs work ok?

Hi @Augustina Sidor,
Had a remote session with the customer:

This is how the Patches were applied:

They seem to have done the following:

	 - 	upgraded to 5.9.0.0
	 - 	
	 - 	applied fix on 5.9.0.0
	 - 	upgraded to 5.9.1.0
	 - 	upgraded to 5.9.2.0
	 - 	applied fix for 5.9.2.0
	 - 	upgraded to 5.9.3.0
	 - 	applied fix for 5.9.3.0 3 times

I checked but unfortunately the customer does not have CAP module enabled:

The normal logs are okay:


Thank you!
Flaviu
