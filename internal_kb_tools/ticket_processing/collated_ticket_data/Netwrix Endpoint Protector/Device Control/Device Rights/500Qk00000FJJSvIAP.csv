Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that on Computer, where a specific device was Allowed to connect a few months ago, and it worked well until last month.
For some reason, the device started blocking on this PC and the connection icon in the EPP client UI is gray color.
If user track mouse to this icon it says ""Device Disconnected"" but actually this device is plugged to the computer.
The device type is USB disk drive.
Can you please clarify why it could happen?
