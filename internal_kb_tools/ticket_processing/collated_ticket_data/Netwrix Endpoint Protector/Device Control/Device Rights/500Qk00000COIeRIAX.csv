"500Qk00000COIeRIAX","00413315","Support Ticket","URGENT ISSUE","We applied the console updates from todayâ€™s security advisory and now our whitelisting is not working. The server still shows all our whitelisted devices, but they are blocked on the endpoints. Re-adding each device one by one to the same Allowed group its already in resolves the issue, but we have far too many devices to do that on everything. It also still wants to apply the hotfix, even though the logs show it as applied.","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","26.9","Closed - Resolved","Optics 1","Gregg Monagle","2024-06-27T18:01:31.000Z","2024-07-24T16:02:05.000Z"
