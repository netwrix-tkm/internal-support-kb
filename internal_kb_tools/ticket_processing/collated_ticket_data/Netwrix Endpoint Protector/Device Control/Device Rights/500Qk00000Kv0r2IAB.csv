"500Qk00000Kv0r2IAB","00433138","Support Ticket","iPhone media transfer blocked since newest client version","So far with older client versions of the endpoint protector it was possible to transfer media data such as pictures from iPhones onto Windows 11 clients that had the Endpoint Protector client installed.

The permissions for iPhones were always set on Global Rights to ""Deny Access but allow charging"". So far it was still possible to transfer pictures, which was totally fine for our use-case.

Now with the newest version 6.2.4.2 the transfer of pictures is also not possible anymore.

Is this intended?
It was really handy for us that media transfer was still possible before the update.

Now we're facing the issue that many of our employees are requesting access for their iPhones because it is no longer possible.","","","","Solved using the latest EPP Client","","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","43.1","Closed - Resolved","Schw√§bische Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH","Andre Knittel","2025-01-22T12:25:00.000Z","2025-03-06T13:38:35.000Z"
