You can access Device Control -> Groups -> Create a group where you include all the machines which should have access to the removable devices.
Once the group is set up, you can access Device Control -> Groups -> Edit the group's rights -> Allow the storage devices for the group.

This way all the computers which are included in the group will now have access on the storage devices.

Let me know if you would like to schedule a remote session for tomorrow in order to assist you with this.

Best regards,
Emil
