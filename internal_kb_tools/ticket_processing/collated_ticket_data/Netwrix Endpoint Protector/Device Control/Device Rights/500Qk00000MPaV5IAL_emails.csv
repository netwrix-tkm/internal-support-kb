Hi Iosif,

Thanks for the update. Our EPP Server is on the latest version and our Clients are only a version behind.

Did / Could the engineers share any further detail about what causes this event, to show a ""NoUser"" listed in EPP, so we can further understand this.

Does this NoUser cause devices to be duplicated within the EPP Server? We have a multitude of devices that once we input a Serial Number and Device Code, we sometimes see 3-4 entries (or more)","Netwrix Support Ticket #437353 - NoUser Appearing as a username","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","Conor Lane","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-04-09T15:41:42.000Z","true"

The ""NoUser"" username appears usually when there is no user logged in to the machine. For example, if one restarts a machine, the Login screen appears, but no one logs at the machine, it is normal to have no user. 
The engineers checked the logs and indeed, the EPP client did not detect any user logged at the moment the logs were collected. Moreover, the tasklist that is exported shows no real user logged, the processes that are running have as owner the System.
 
Please ensure the EPP clients are updated to the latest version and let us know if this changes the situation.

Regarding the duplicate devices issue, it is likely not related to the ""NoUser"". Please raise a new ticket for that specific issue.

Thank you!
