Thank you for your time today!
As stated, I manged to track down the issue internally.
To be more specific- Effective rights report might generate the wrong rights being shown(i.e, a user having no rights/denied, and being displayed as allowed)
A fix for this is being targeted in the next version release, so 5.9.4.0 which should not be too far away.
I will leave the case opened meanwhile, and do get back here with updates, after the server version gets released and you apply the patch and retest the scenario.
