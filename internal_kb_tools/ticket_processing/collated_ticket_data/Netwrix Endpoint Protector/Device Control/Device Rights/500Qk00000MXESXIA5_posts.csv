User is unable to unblock an external connected device.
The following error message appears:
""Invalid credentials. The connection could not be initialized.""
--> see screenshot ""<a href='https://EP_LPTP2043748_Unblocking_error_message.jpg' target='_blank'>EP_LPTP2043748_Unblocking_error_message.jpg</a>"".

Description:
User is in South Africa for a measurement/test campaign. This involves using measuring devices that are blocked and therefore need to be unblocked manually. If the user is in a location without internet access and requires the unblocking, it may happen that no unlocking is granted (see error message).
As soon as the user has access to the Internet again, the unblocking is functional again!

Expectation:
Please check why the external devices cannot be unblocked offline and make sure that the problem does not happen again in the future.

Workaround:
The external devices used by the user have been whitelisted to ensure that userÂ´s work runs smoothly.

Hint:
- The operations team has not been able to reproduce the problem so far.
- Unblocking external devices offline works as expected.
- Testing is therefore only possible if the user is in South Africa and the whitelisting of the external devices has been removed.
