27 March: I've connected to them in a session, and they were not receiving the notifications because the Client Mode was on Silent. After changing it to Normal, it was ok.
- I also helped them set up a PII CAP policy, and from the first tests it was successfull for e-mail Adresses.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-27T11:37:29.000Z"
