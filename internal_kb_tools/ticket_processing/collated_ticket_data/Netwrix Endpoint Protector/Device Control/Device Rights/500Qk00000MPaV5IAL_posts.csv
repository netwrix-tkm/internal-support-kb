Just a quick question, if you don't mind?

My team and I have noticed an account called 'NoUser' within Device Control -> Users that appears to be checking in every minute, across all devices within the company, such that if you search for that user and refresh the search, the ""last computer"" field changes every time.

Is this normal?

If so, is there any available explanation as to what this noUser account is? Can we remove it without causing any impact? I notice that it has the groups set as ""Allow All"" which is the only example of this within the company.

Many Thanks,
Conor","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-28T12:06:41.000Z"
