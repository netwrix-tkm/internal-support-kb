I have a few computers that are allowed USB access which shouldn't be the case. They all have EPP installed and I do not see the computers or the users in a USB bypass policy. 

The strange thing is the computer object does not show up in the EPP console either. Do you know what might be causing this issue?","","The EPP clients are not able to communicate with the server, and this might be the reason for the USB to be allowed. We answered the customer's questions about the client server communication.","Waiting for the customer's feedback.","The  EPP agent was deployed without the server IP and port being correctly configured. The customer will redeploy the agent following the provided documentation.","Other","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Iovance BioTherapeutics","Michael Aquinde","2025-04-24T21:34:50.000Z","2025-04-25T18:33:02.000Z"
