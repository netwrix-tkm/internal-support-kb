Hi Iosif,

I hope you are well.

A similar issue has been raised on another customer last year and a test built was sent which the customer confirmed that it solves the issue:Â https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp20062024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0037.zip

The fix for this issue has been included in 5.9.4.1, so we recommend that the customer upgrades to 5.9.4.1.

Regards,
Cristi
