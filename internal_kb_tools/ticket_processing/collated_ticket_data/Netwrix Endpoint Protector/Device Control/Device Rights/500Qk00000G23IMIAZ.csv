User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not appear to unblock the card either.
--> Please take a look at the error message and the SD card used in the screenshot “<a href='https://EM_SD_Card_BW07984890.jpg' target='_blank'>EM_SD_Card_BW07984890.jpg</a>” attached.

Analysis:
- The SD card is not displayed in the EPP client!
- There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Hint:
- After connecting a USB device, the user was able to unblock the device using the Endpoint Protector PopUp window.
- But there have been no logs collected from this USB connection process on the server console!

Please analyze this behavior.

We were connected and found out that the problem was that an SD card was allowed when the rights were set to deny. This was because the connection between the unify and nodes was not done correctly and when the right was deleted from unify it couldn't be deleted from nodes. We made the connection ok, so all the modifications made after to be executed ok and we deleted the right from the nodes, that was deleted on unify server.","Root Cause Unknown","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","217.1","Closed - Resolved","BMW Group AG","Christian Spies","2024-09-20T10:46:21.000Z","2025-04-25T12:41:28.000Z"
