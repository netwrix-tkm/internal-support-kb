Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

The resolution for this is to add the process ""Outlook"" to the whitelisted applications under ""System Parameters"" > ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"".

	Please enable ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"".
	Add the word ""Outlook"" inside the box for ""Application Process Name"" then click on ""Add to content"".  The message ""Apps successfully added to list!"" will appear.  See below screenshots.
	The process ""Outlook"" will now be listed under ""Whitelisted Applications""
	Select the process name and then click on ""Generate"", the message ""App list successfully uploaded!"" will appear as shown in the last screenshot below.
	Update the polices on the endpoint machine, close Outlook. Open Outlook again and re-test the scenario.












Please let me know if this resolved your issue or if you encountered any issues.

Regarding the AD Sync topic, did you try to resync it and check it again after that? Do you receive any errors or messages?

Hello,

I followed the instructions, but the issue is still present, the users are still unable to print.
I also tried to start the sync with AD, but it's not working. It seems that is working only on specified schedule.
I have not seen any errors on sync.

Please advise,
Mircea Gavrila

Thank you for your reply.
Please perform a server restart and a computer restart and let us know after that the result.
For the AD you can try to do a force sync as seen in the screenshot below:

If you press the Test button, is the connection valid?

Hello,

We performed all the steps that you told us to do, but the issue was still present.
We found out that problem was actually related to the device of the user, and we managed to solve it by deleting the devices from Netwrix. After the device was recreated, there were no more problems.
You can go ahead and close the ticket.

Best regards,
Mircea Gavrila

Hello Cristian,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00426623. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00426623
Ticket Subject: Trouble when printing from Outlook
Ticket Details: Hello,
I have some users that cannot print from Outlook, printing is blocked by Netwrix.
Their settings are generic (preserve global settings) and printing is allowed.
Also I think there is an issue with synchronization between AD server and Netwrix Endpoint Protector, some OU groups are not up to date on Netwrix and users are not in right groups

Thank you,
Mircea Gavrila

Thank you!
