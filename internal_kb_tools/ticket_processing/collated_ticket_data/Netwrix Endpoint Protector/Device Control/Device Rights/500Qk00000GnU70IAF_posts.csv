They have some questions about Device control detections:


""Performing a review of Bluetooth connections from the cososys platform, and filtering the Bluetooth records, on the connections to SmartPhone.

What we have in doubt is that we found records that say noUser and we searched on the Internet about the content of this value, and we found a document from the manual.

It was understood that noUser is when processes are made when a user is not logged in, then the COSOSYS DLP software places the value of noUser in the user field; as a result of this, there is a query, in this regard, and we urgently need to clarify for auditing reasons;

The question is: does this record represent a communication or connection attempt via Bluetooth, and also if this represents that it is already established or is it a communication of attempts, in the way that if a smartphone via Bluetooth tried to connect to the equipment.

Also, is it possible to review at a lower level, the communication frames?

I Attach the logs.

Best regards!","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2024-10-28T16:39:58.000Z"
