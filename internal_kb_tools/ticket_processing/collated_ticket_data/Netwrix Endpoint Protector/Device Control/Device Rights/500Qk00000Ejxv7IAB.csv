"500Qk00000Ejxv7IAB","00418728","Support Ticket","USB access no longer being controlled by Endpoint Protector","We have recently started the process of getting our laptops into Autopilot and with that being the case we created a security policy that enabled bitlocker. In the process of doing testing, I realised that USBs were being set to read only regardless of whether a user is in the allow or block usb group. Those 2 groups were previously controlled by Endpoint Protector but since applying the policies and configs we set up for Autopilot devices Endpoint doesn’t seem to be controlling USB access anymore.
 
I want to know if there is something we have enabled or disabled that is causing this issue. Any help on this would be appreciated as currently everyone set up on an Autopilot Device within our estate can at least read USB devices regardless of group they are in which isn’t what we want.","","","","Closing ticket as resolved as customer has path to resolution for users seeing the issue. Issue is due to not having enough licenses for current user base. I contacted their Account executive to assist with the purchase of additional licenses.","","Zachary Roy","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Global Switch","Felix Tekyi","2024-08-21T14:30:08.000Z","2024-08-28T13:51:28.000Z"
