This problem occurred because on the 17 th of february we deleted all the computer from the nodes that could not get to the Unify server due to the deletion process. When these computers that were deleted, communicated, they were added, but before being added the rights were set to blocked, till the client communicated and got the correct rights. We verified on the server and the rights for the  Yubikeys with vid 1050 and pid 407 for device type Card Reader Device (SCSI) and Chip Card Device are set to allow.
This problem should not be present as soon as all computers that were deleted communicate.

The global settings should normally remain saved on the client (Yubikey was whitelisted).

Even if the client is deleted from the console, the client should retrieve the policies on the next communication and the local settings may only be overwritten/applied if the communication was successful and the setting has been retrieved.

 

He is asking us if we can check internally how to ensure that the settings only take effect when the communication is complete?","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-02-20T11:58:03.000Z","2025-02-20T11:58:03.000Z","false","false"

Using the steps described, we were not able to reproduce the issue. 
Mihaela's explanation is plausible in this specific case.

We were not able to reproduce this on our env, and we could not investigate on BMW side as well, because when we connected, everything was working fine. When deleting the computers, some of them might have switched the nodes and because of this it might have happened. We did that on our local env but to us it worked. But if this thing happens again the best thing to do is to delete the right form the UI that seems not to work and add it again for Specific Devices, and to update the right for Device Types that are not working. This should solve the problem all the time.

Please check/document how the agent behaves if the global settings are not transferred correctly to the client and when the agent overwrites/activates the setting.

If the client only activates the global settings when they are successfully retrieved and blocking only occurs when the global settings have been processed, it should be fine.
If a blockage occurs during the retrieval of the policy (policy not yet fully retrieved), the process should be revised.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-11T14:46:07.000Z","2025-03-11T14:46:07.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer
The documentation was initially planned to be part of the general availability release. However, considering the business decision to discontinue the project, the documentation will no longer be updated.

We had our bi-monthly meeting with the customer today and we tried to clarify if he needs documentation on this and the answer was No.
They would like to know how the agent behaves if the global settings are not transferred correctly to the client and when the agent overwrites/activates the setting.

If the client only activates the global settings when they are successfully retrieved and blocking only occurs when the global settings have been processed, it should be fine.
If a blockage occurs during the retrieval of the policy (policy not yet fully retrieved and the device is getting a blocked right until the policy is retrieved), then it is not fine.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-25T15:39:44.000Z","2025-03-25T15:39:44.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Please see Mihaela's comment from 3rd of March
The issue here was just related to the settings between Unify app and Nodes (nothing extra). The agent is applying the settings received by server.
