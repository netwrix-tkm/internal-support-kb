"00aQk000007WZTFIA4","500Qk00000CCjVWIA1","Looks like a config issue.
They have a few different kinds of USB authentication tokens that are classed
Chip Card Reader
Card Reader Device (SCSI)
They need these devices to perform some regulatory tasks at the end of the trading day ($$$ fines per country if not done).  For APAC users, they just uninstalled the agent.  Now anticipating same problem when UK/EMEA trading closes (11 AM EDT).  They're doing an emergency change to create a new group to allow those two classes.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-06-24T17:18:08.000Z","2024-06-24T17:18:08.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007WlZFIA0","500Qk00000CCjVWIA1","OK, just called Nish.  They ended up having to allow a 3rd device type (he thinks Internal Card Reader) to enable all the various USB tokens, but now it seem to be work.
Coming up: US end of day at 4PM EDT, then APAC start of day at 6PM EDT.
In APAC they removed the EPP agent yesterday, so they will put it back and confirm that the exception group is working as expected.
They don't need any further support from us for now.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-06-24T19:18:22.000Z","2024-06-24T19:18:22.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007WjlzIAC","500Qk00000CCjVWIA1","From customer chat with Dan Drees:  Still good? ""I think so but we need to wait for APIAPAC to come back online tomorrow. Pushed a policy change earlier that appears to be managing the new devices correctly. Thanks for rallying the troops, we'll have a good RCA meeting once we get this behind us.""","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-06-24T19:24:54.000Z","2024-06-24T19:24:54.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007XyFtIAK","500Qk00000CCjVWIA1","Met this morning.
Yesterday's problem is resolved.  They're still working on adding all the necessary users to the exception group.
Last Friday they went ahead and deployed all the remaining Windows agents.  (Their deadline was June 30 and they had planned to do half on 6/21 and the remainder on 6/28.)  So they are fully deployed now.
Working on the Unify server issues today and tomorrow with Dev.
Over the next month, they want to sort out the device miscategorizations (previous ones discussed above, plus YubiKey and similar auth tokens) and remove the workarounds where we allowed BT-Other, Local Printers, Card Reader, etc.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-06-25T15:32:00.000Z","2024-06-25T15:32:00.000Z","false","false"
