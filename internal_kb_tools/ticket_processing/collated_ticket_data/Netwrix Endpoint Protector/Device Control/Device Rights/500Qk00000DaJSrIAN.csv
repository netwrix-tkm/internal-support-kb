"500Qk00000DaJSrIAN","00416208","Support Ticket","Global Rights for USB-Sticks do not apply","In our deployment we deny access to USB Storage Device to standard users. However, some special USB-Devices should be allowed to be used on all devices. 
Therefore we configured Global Rights for these devices (see <a href='https://globalRights.png' target='_blank'>globalRights.png</a>). 

Interestingly for the stick with ID 04013DC910CCD36F79DA7593679F9FBDDE0C051D52247197BD4B381C9C7A1B64625300000000000000000000A0DA2FEBFF9A01189155810749AE06B2 this works and it is usable on all devices (<a href='https://works.png' target='_blank'>works.png</a>). 

In contrast to that, the stick with ID 0401B71537A572D8A0BDF55361143FC4DB5815A8F8F8D27F970878C91D15F5DBF52100000000000000000000FB2EC82A000D0F189155810749AE010C does not work with global rights (<a href='https://doesntWork.PNG' target='_blank'>doesntWork.PNG</a>). This stick only works once we set exclipit device rights on a PC (<a href='https://explicitDeviceRights.PNG' target='_blank'>explicitDeviceRights.PNG</a>). 

As I do not want to add each laptop manually I would like to use the global rights for all USB-sticks.","","","","The customer confirmed the right is applied correctly.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Rights","NONE","","4.9","Closed - Resolved","Bundesministerium f√ºr Justiz","Wolfgang Schlapschy","2024-07-26T09:24:36.000Z","2024-07-31T07:41:38.000Z"
