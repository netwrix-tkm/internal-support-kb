I have some users that cannot print from Outlook, printing is blocked by Netwrix.
Their settings are generic (preserve global settings) and printing is allowed.
Also I think there is an issue with synchronization between AD server and Netwrix Endpoint Protector, some OU groups are not up to date on Netwrix and users are not in right groups

Thank you,
Mircea Gavrila","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-11T09:53:51.000Z"
