Thank you for joining today's remote session.

During the meeting, we successfully applied the Offline Patch http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz, and were able to download the latest EPP Client(6.2.4.2).

We are going to close this ticket as resolved.
