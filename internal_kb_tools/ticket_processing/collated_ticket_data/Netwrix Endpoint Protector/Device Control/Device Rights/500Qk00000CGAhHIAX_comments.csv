Can you please try to uninstall the agent and install an agent from 594 release candidate. I observed in logs few errors, but with an agent resintall should work.
You can ask for a download link from scrum or QA.

Please bee aware the ""remove data base"" will be checked when the agent will be uninstalled.

If the problem persists please:

	 - 	collect again the logs (try to collect append logs to see if the agent will crash)

	 - 	made a short video
	 - 	they uses any antivirus? any other third party dlp solution?
	 - 	we can replicate the mentioned scenario with the mentioned app?

The customer has an update regarding this.

""At first it was again not possible to write to the drives.

Then we uninstalled EPP, but it was still not possible to write to the drive (this time we did not try to remove the device driver). Instead, my colleague immediately came up with the idea of uninstalling Samsung Magician, after which it was possible to write to the drives. We then reinstalled EPP and it was still possible to write to the drives.""

After remote session with customer we concluded the same issue can be replicated also without epp client installed.

Can we receive a download link for agent from 594 release?
