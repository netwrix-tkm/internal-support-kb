Yubikeys with the following IDs are globally whitelisted:
VID: 1050
PID: 407

Description:
Since Monday, February 17, 2025, Yubikeys that are actually globally whitelisted have suddenly been blocked for no apparent reason.
The first problem reports were received at around 4:30 p.m. CET. However, according to logs, the first blockings began at 7:22 a.m. CET. According to logs, Yubikeys are currently still being blocked.
The Operations Team has whitelisted the affected Yubikey globally again. At the moment, the blocking seems to be lifted as soon as the affected computer updates the policies.

Expectation:
Request a statement as to why the Yubikey with the mentioned VID and PID is blocked and what is the reason behind this.
How can problems of this kind be prevented in the future?
Unfortunately, it cannot be said with certainty whether the problem has actually been resolved, as according to logs it still occurs.
Does the issue still exist?

Hint:
Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide log files.

Log report ""<a href='https://exportgenerated_1739964503283_0.xlsx' target='_blank'>exportgenerated_1739964503283_0.xlsx</a>"" has been attached.

Please give us a statement as requested.
