This is the expected behavior as Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1 will only allow access to the USB over EasyLock.

To see the preexisting files, you can either set the right for USB devices to allow access to be able to access the USB device. In this case, you can allow a specific USB device if needed.

Or from the personal desktop computer, you can include the file to the EasyLock app. EasyLock can be opened manually on computers without Epp client.

Please let me know if you have questions or if you wish to try the above together in a remote connection.

Hi Andrei,

I was testing this setup on a MacBook, I can access usb-storage drive files from finder, however on a windows machine, I cannot. I was using Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1+

Can we have the option to view USB-files from file explorer and at the same time EasyLock app installed automatically?

Thanks for your response. To deploy the Easy Lock app through EPP, we need to select the USB device and copy the package to its root directory. This method of deploying the app to multiple devices doesn't seem scalable.

Then you can try to set the right as ""Allow Access if TD level 1+, otherwise Read Only"", or ""Read Only"".

Adding to my previous email:
 

The end goal is to allow users to read data from USB drives freely. However, if they wish to write any data, they will be compelled to encrypt it using EasyLock

Hello,

That is impossible because Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1+ is designed to block the USB device and install the EasyLock app.
Alternatively, you can allow access to the USB device and install EasyLock from the Epp app.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei, 

 

I was testing this setup on a MacBook, I can access usb-storage drive files from finder, however on a windows machine, I cannot. I was using Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1+

 

Can we have the option to view USB-files from file explorer and at the same time EasyLock app installed automatically?

 

Regards,

Mani

Hello,

This is the expected behavior as Allow Access if Trusted Device Level 1 will only allow access to the USB over EasyLock.

To see the preexisting files, you can either set the right for USB devices to allow access to be able to access the USB device. In this case, you can allow a specific USB device if needed.

Or from the personal desktop computer, you can include the file to the EasyLock app. EasyLock can be opened manually on computers without Epp client.

Please let me know if you have questions or if you wish to try the above together in a remote connection.

Kind regards
