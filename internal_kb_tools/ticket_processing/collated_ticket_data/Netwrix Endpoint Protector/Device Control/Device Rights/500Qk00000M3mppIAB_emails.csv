Hi Alin,

Please check/document how the agent behaves if the global settings are not transferred correctly to the client and when the agent overwrites/activates the setting.

If the client only activates the global settings when they are successfully retrieved and blocking only occurs when the global settings have been processed, it should be fine.
If a blockage occurs during the retrieval of the policy (policy not yet fully retrieved), the process should be revised.

Regards

I hope you are well.
The issue here was just related to the settings between Unify app and Nodes (nothing extra). The agent is applying the settings received by server.
Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.
