If the computer does not show up in the EPP UI, it means that the agent on those machines didn't communicate with the server, that being also the reason for which the USB restriction is not enforced.

Can you please check in System Configuration - System Licensing to make sure you have available licenses and if so, then check if the EPP server IP is reachable from one of the machines in question?

Also, if there are available licenses, can you try uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on one of the machines where the issue is present and let us know how it works afterwards?

Thank you and best regards,

Regarding your first question: the EPP does not automatically remove computers from the console. However, this issue may occur if the computer was never able to communicate with the EPP server after deployment.

For your second question: the EPP server communicates with its clients over port 443.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Hi Michael,

Regarding your first question: the EPP does not automatically remove computers from the console. However, this issue may occur if the computer was never able to communicate with the EPP server after deployment.

For your second question: the EPP server communicates with its clients over port 443.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Thank you!

I have another question. What ports does the EPP client / server use to communicate with each other?

Hello,

I provided a screenshot of our licensing and if the device can reach the EPP server. It seems this device cannot reach the server… If a device cannot reach the server, would it remove the device automatically from the EPP console?

HI Michael,

If the computer does not show up in the EPP UI, it means that the agent on those machines didn't communicate with the server, that being also the reason for which the USB restriction is not enforced.

Can you please check in System Configuration - System Licensing to make sure you have available licenses and if so, then check if the EPP server IP is reachable from one of the machines in question?

Also, if there are available licenses, can you try uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on one of the machines where the issue is present and let us know how it works afterwards?

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Michael,

Regarding your first question: the EPP does not automatically remove computers from the console. However, this issue may occur if the computer was never able to communicate with the EPP server after deployment.

For your second question: the EPP server communicates with its clients over port 443.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

Thank you!

I have another question. What ports does the EPP client / server use to communicate with each other?

Hello,

I provided a screenshot of our licensing and if the device can reach the EPP server. It seems this device cannot reach the server… If a device cannot reach the server, would it remove the device automatically from the EPP console?

HI Michael,

If the computer does not show up in the EPP UI, it means that the agent on those machines didn't communicate with the server, that being also the reason for which the USB restriction is not enforced.

Can you please check in System Configuration - System Licensing to make sure you have available licenses and if so, then check if the EPP server IP is reachable from one of the machines in question?

Also, if there are available licenses, can you try uninstalling and reinstalling the EPP agent on one of the machines where the issue is present and let us know how it works afterwards?

Thank you and best regards,
