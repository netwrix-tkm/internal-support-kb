Subject: Gray icon beside Device in the EPP client UI [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0FJJSv:ref ]

Hello Danylo,

The customer can try to access Device Control -> Devices -> Filter for last computer -> look for the device in cause -> click on the actions button on the right side of the device -> Manage rights -> set the allow access for the device for the computer and user.
This way the device will be allowed.
If it does not work, let me know and we can schedule a remote session in order to investigate further.

Best regards,
Emil
