Hello.
I checked this case and could not reproduce. 
Based on the error message from the client, it seems like the credentials are not the correct ones.
User needs to make sure that the password filled in is the correct one for the logged in user.

That was my first thought but as already mentioned, the user is able to unlock the devices as soon as an Internet connection is restored. So in my opinion, the credentials should be fine.

Please investigate further, thank you","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-03-06T07:22:36.000Z","2025-03-06T07:22:36.000Z","false","false"

Tried again for a bunch of other devices: USB storage, Bluetooth other, Network Printers and MTP, for all the devices self remediation was successful. All device were remediate with internet turned off.
I uploaded in the Attachment Folder a video with self remediation of the usb and a print screen for the MTP logs, after the internet was reactivated on the computer.

Please compare the log files (epp_logs_LPTP2043748_2025-03-04.zip) that were recorded during the outage in South Africa with those from the last tests (LPTP2043748_online_2025-04-03.zip / LPTP2043748_offline_2025-04-03.zip).

Eduard compared already the two offline ones, and found a difference, that in the offline log from Germany, the user shows up as logged, and in the one from South Africa the user is missing.
Please see the screenshot ""Comparison between offline log in Germany vs offline log from South Africa.png"".

Please check it from your side and let us know if you can find the cause of the issue after you compared the two logs.

I was lucky and managed to reproduce this issue (you can read the details in the description of the linked user story). A test build (compatible with EPP 5.9.4.3) with a fix is available on the Cluj-Napoca file-server at this location:
