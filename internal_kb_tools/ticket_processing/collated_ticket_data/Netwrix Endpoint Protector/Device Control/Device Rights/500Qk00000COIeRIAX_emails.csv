I have availability right now for a remote session, or later today. Please let me know if I should send an invite for now or at a later time today.

Regarding the Vulnerability patch it is sufficient if it is applied once. If it was applied several times it is also okay. The Vulnerability upgrade appears in the list because it is a non-versioned server patch(can be applied to any EPP server version 5.9.0.0, 5.9.1.0...5.9.3.0). If it was applied to 5.9.3.0, it no longer needs to be applied.

Hi Ben,

I have availability right now for a remote session, or later today. Please let me know if I should send an invite for now or at a later time today.

Regarding the Vulnerability patch it is sufficient if it is applied once. If it was applied several times it is also okay. The Vulnerability upgrade appears in the list because it is a non-versioned server patch(can be applied to any EPP server version 5.9.0.0, 5.9.1.0...5.9.3.0). If it was applied to 5.9.3.0, it no longer needs to be applied.

What is the soonest you can do a remote session? We applied the hotfix several times; it shows as “Applied” in the list on the appliance, but then it also continues to be offered for installation.

Hi Ben,

We have received an update from our devs regarding this case.

They asked if we can take a look to see if the fix patch was applied after the EPP server upgrade to 5.9.3.0.

Please let me know if you have availability today for a quick remote session so we can take a look.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we fixed the issue for the device rights by marking duplicate devices as deleted, deleting the mcache and rebuilding the php + deleting the cached rights from the intermediate mysql tables.

We will leave this ticket open for 1-2 more days to make sure that the issue is completely resolved.

For the File Tracing logs, as we discussed this is a known issue and it is being worked on rights now. Please also raise a separate Support Ticket and we will update you on it.

Hi Gregg,

Apologies, I just saw your email.

Do you by any chance have time now for a quick remote session? or should we schedule for tomorrow or Wednesday.
