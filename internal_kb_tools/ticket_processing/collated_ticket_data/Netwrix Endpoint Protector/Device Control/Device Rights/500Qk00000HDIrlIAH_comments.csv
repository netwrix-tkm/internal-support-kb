@WaitingOnEngineer

Please check Salesforce 00422625 (https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/359484), use the same build I prepared for that case and get back to us with the results.

The customer installed the test agent.Before the installation there were 20 entries in the console on that computer. After the installation, it is showing more than 5K entries in the devices on that computer.

Please advise.

@WaitingOnEngineer

We started this ADO entry with some devices that were missing. What is reported now here looks like a different issue, no? Anyway, the test build provided contains some debug logs. Without the logs, there is nothing that I can say. Can we get some logs from that build? And as mentioned in the other support case, please be more specific when you describe the issue (if the other issue is still reproduced). Thanks!

This is the correct ticket where the comment was made.
We could not access the end users computer to generate log files.
What we saw in the EPP UI was that almost all device types(WIfi, Local Printers, Network Printers, Keyboards, etc) had duplicates.

Please provide me with a full list of device_type_id(for all device types) so I can run the below command and delete the duplicate devices:
delete from clientdevice where device_type_id = 45 order by id desc limit 10000;
