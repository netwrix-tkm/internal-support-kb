"500Qk00000FGNg0IAH","00419872","Support Ticket","Request to review EPP Device control settings","Hello team,

Weâ€™ve observed that many devices/computers are currently listed as unlicensed in the EPP administration dashboard. Additionally, some machines are still able to transfer data to external USB drives, despite our restrictions on USB data transfers.

We would like you to review the EPP device control configuration to address these issues and improve our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) measures and enhance the data security.

Let us know if you need any info. Thank you!","","The customer is facing an issue where the client is not communicating to the server, however it appears as online and licensed on the server, but the client version doesn't appear correctly - screenshot attached
