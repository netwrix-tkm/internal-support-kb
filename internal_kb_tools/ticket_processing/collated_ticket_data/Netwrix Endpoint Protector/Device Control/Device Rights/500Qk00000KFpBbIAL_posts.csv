Somehow, that registry file contains encrypted values about allowed/denied devices, and these values are decrypted by the software on the client.
If the client can contact the server, pull is done from the client. And vice-versa.
If the client is fully offline, then we can import the registry file even if the client will never contact the server.

So my question is: I would like to know if Netwrix has a possibility to work in an offline mode in the EPP client-server model.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-06T09:45:26.000Z"
