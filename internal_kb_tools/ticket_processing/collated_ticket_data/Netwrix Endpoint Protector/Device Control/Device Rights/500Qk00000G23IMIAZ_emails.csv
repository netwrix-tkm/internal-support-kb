Hello,

please do not close the ticket.
This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.
I will come back to you once testing has been completed.
Thank you for your understanding.

Hello,

testing has been carried out.

Initial situation:

  *   User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
  *   The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
  *   The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
  *   There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Expectation:

  *   After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)""
  *   The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
  *   The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
  *   Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

  *   The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
  *   The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
  *   There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.
Log files ""LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip"" have been uploaded to vendor website.

Thank you.

Hello,

 

please do not close the ticket.

This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.

I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

Thank you for your understanding.

In order to go further with the investigation, the engineering team would need to have a remote session with the affected computer where the scenario is reproducible.
Can you please share the availability in order to perform this?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

Hello,

 

testing has been carried out.

 

Initial situation:

User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Expectation:

After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

Log files “LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip” have been uploaded to vendor website.

 

Thank you.

 

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

 

testing has been carried out.

 

Initial situation:

User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Expectation:

After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

Log files “LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip” have been uploaded to vendor website.

 

Thank you.

 

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

 

please do not close the ticket.

This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.

I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Hello,

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:

  *   The SD card reader is blocked again.
  *   Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.

Attention:

  *   After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self ""Remediate"" pop-up window appears for manual approval.
  *   The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
  *   Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.

Please briefly summarize the following again:

  *   What was the cause of the problem?
  *   How was it resolved?
  *   How can it be prevented in the future?

The ticket can then be closed.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

Hello,

testing has been carried out.

Initial situation:

  1.  User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Expectation:

  1.  After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)""
  2.  The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

  1.  The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
  3.  There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.
Log files ""LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip"" have been uploaded to vendor website.

Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

please do not close the ticket.
This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.
I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.
 
- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

As you mentioned in the previous email, once these are provided we can go forward and close this ticket.

Have a nice day,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref



Hello,

 

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:


	The SD card reader is blocked again.
	Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.


 

Attention:


	After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self “Remediate” pop-up window appears for manual approval.
	The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
	Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.


 

Please briefly summarize the following again:


	What was the cause of the problem?
	How was it resolved?
	How can it be prevented in the future?


 

The ticket can then be closed.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

a few comments/questions on point 3: How can it be prevented in the future?


  *   No rights were added here! Only a single global right was removed on the Unify server.
So, my question:
How can Netwrix ensure that removing and adding a global right definitely works?
  *   ""If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration""
How can actually be checked whether added rights are being taken into consideration?
Usually, after adding a global right, the affected user is checked to see whether, for example, access is functional.

Thank you for your response in advance!


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.

- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

As you mentioned in the previous email, once these are provided we can go forward and close this ticket.

Have a nice day,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref


Hello,

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:

  1.  The SD card reader is blocked again.
  2.  Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.

Attention:

  1.  After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self ""Remediate"" pop-up window appears for manual approval.
  2.  The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
  3.  Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.

Please briefly summarize the following again:

  1.  What was the cause of the problem?
  2.  How was it resolved?
  3.  How can it be prevented in the future?

The ticket can then be closed.
Thank you.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

Hello,

testing has been carried out.

Initial situation:

  1.  User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Expectation:

  1.  After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)""
  2.  The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

  1.  The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
  3.  There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.
Log files ""LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip"" have been uploaded to vendor website.

Thank you.

Hello,

please do not close the ticket.
This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.
I will come back to you once testing has been completed.
Thank you for your understanding.

I hope you are well.
Please see the answer below:
One solution to verify, in case there is a suspicion it might still occur, would be to reuse the same device on two different endpoints to see if the behavior is consistent and if the global rights are at fault. 
As to prevention, currently we consider this occurrence to have been remote with very low probability of it happening again in the future.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref
 


Hello,

 

testing has been carried out.

 

Initial situation:


	User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
	The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
	There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Expectation:


	After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”
	The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
	The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
	Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:


	The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already  unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
	There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

Log files “LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip” have been uploaded to vendor website.

 

Thank you.

Hello,

 

please do not close the ticket.

This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.

I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answer below:
One solution to verify, in case there is a suspicion it might still occur, would be to reuse the same device on two different endpoints to see if the behavior is consistent and if the global rights are at fault.
As to prevention, currently we consider this occurrence to have been remote with very low probability of it happening again in the future.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref


Hello,

a few comments/questions on point 3: How can it be prevented in the future?


  1.  No rights were added here! Only a single global right was removed on the Unify server.
So, my question:
How can Netwrix ensure that removing and adding a global right definitely works?
  2.  ""If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration""
How can actually be checked whether added rights are being taken into consideration?
Usually, after adding a global right, the affected user is checked to see whether, for example, access is functional.

Thank you for your response in advance!


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.

- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

As you mentioned in the previous email, once these are provided we can go forward and close this ticket.

Have a nice day,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref


Hello,

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:

  1.  The SD card reader is blocked again.
  2.  Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.

Attention:

  1.  After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self ""Remediate"" pop-up window appears for manual approval.
  2.  The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
  3.  Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.

Please briefly summarize the following again:

  1.  What was the cause of the problem?
  2.  How was it resolved?
  3.  How can it be prevented in the future?

The ticket can then be closed.
Thank you.

Hello,

Please see the answer below:
One solution to verify, in case there is a suspicion it might still occur, would be to reuse the same device on two different endpoints to see if the behavior is consistent and if the global rights are at fault.

Hello,

 

a few comments/questions on point 3: How can it be prevented in the future?

 


	No rights were added here! Only a single global right was removed on the Unify server.
	So, my question:
	How can Netwrix ensure that removing and adding a global right definitely works?
	“If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration”
	How can actually be checked whether added rights are being taken into consideration?
	Usually, after adding a global right, the affected user is checked to see whether, for example, access is functional.


 

Thank you for your response in advance!

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.
 
- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

As you mentioned in the previous email, once these are provided we can go forward and close this ticket.

Have a nice day,
Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

 


Hello,

 

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:


	The SD card reader is blocked again.
	Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.


 

Attention:


	After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self “Remediate” pop-up window appears for manual approval.
	The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
	Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.


 

Please briefly summarize the following again:


	What was the cause of the problem?
	How was it resolved?
	How can it be prevented in the future?


 

The ticket can then be closed.

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref
 


Hello,

 

testing has been carried out.

 

Initial situation:


	User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
	The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
	There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Expectation:


	After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”
	The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
	The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
	Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:


	The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already  unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
	There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

Log files “LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip” have been uploaded to vendor website.

 

Thank you.

Hello,

 

please do not close the ticket.

This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.

I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

Thank you for your understanding.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.

- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

As you mentioned in the previous email, once these are provided we can go forward and close this ticket.

Have a nice day,
Best regards,
Alin Anca

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref


Hello,

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:

  1.  The SD card reader is blocked again.
  2.  Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.

Attention:

  1.  After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self ""Remediate"" pop-up window appears for manual approval.
  2.  The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
  3.  Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.

Please briefly summarize the following again:

  1.  What was the cause of the problem?
  2.  How was it resolved?
  3.  How can it be prevented in the future?

The ticket can then be closed.
Thank you.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

Hello,

testing has been carried out.

Initial situation:

  1.  User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Expectation:

  1.  After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)""
  2.  The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
  3.  The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
  4.  Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:

  1.  The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
  2.  The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
  3.  There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.
Log files ""LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip"" have been uploaded to vendor website.

Thank you.

Hello,

please do not close the ticket.
This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.
I will come back to you once testing has been completed.
Thank you for your understanding.

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answer below:
One solution to verify, in case there is a suspicion it might still occur, would be to reuse the same device on two different endpoints to see if the behavior is consistent and if the global rights are at fault. 
As to prevention, currently we consider this occurrence to have been remote with very low probability of it happening again in the future.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

 


Hello,

 

a few comments/questions on point 3: How can it be prevented in the future?

 


	No rights were added here! Only a single global right was removed on the Unify server.
	So, my question:
	How can Netwrix ensure that removing and adding a global right definitely works?
	“If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration”
	How can actually be checked whether added rights are being taken into consideration?
	Usually, after adding a global right, the affected user is checked to see whether, for example, access is functional.


 

Thank you for your response in advance!

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello,

I hope you are well.
Please see the answers to the additional questions below:
- What was the cause of the problem?
  The problem was caused by the fact that on the nodes the traffic was high due to logs or some prevoius action and when a right was deleted from Unify console, it wasn't deleted from the nodes.

- How was it resolved?
  We deleted the right that was deleted from the Unify console also from the nodes.
 
- How can it be prevented in the future?
 If you add multiple rights, please verify that those right are taken into consideration and after add more, if the right is not being added just remove it and add it again because it might be a communication error due to the load.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000G23IM:ref

 


Hello,

 

in yesterday's meeting, you resolved the problem:


	The SD card reader is blocked again.
	Unblocking the SD card is only possible after manual approval.


 

Attention:


	After connecting the SD card to the computer, no Self “Remediate” pop-up window appears for manual approval.
	The window must be triggered via the Endpoint Protector console.
	Ticket 00440963 has been created regarding this topic.


 

Please briefly summarize the following again:


	What was the cause of the problem?
	How was it resolved?
	How can it be prevented in the future?


 

The ticket can then be closed.

Thank you.

Hello,

 

testing has been carried out.

 

Initial situation:


	User is connecting a SD card to a computer. The SD card appears in the Windows Explorer, but there is no access to the card.
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card.
	The SD card (reader) is not displayed in the EPP client!
	There are also no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Expectation:


	After connecting the SD card should be blocked because the device type is ""Card Reader Device (MTD)”
	The EEP window should turn up to unblock the SD card.
	The SD card (reader) should be displayed in the EPP client!
	Log reports should be generated from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Testing results with Unify server version 7.2.0:


	The SD card (reader) is now displayed in the EPP client!
	The Endpoint Protector PopUp window does not turn up to unblock the card, because the SD card (reader) is already  unblocked, even though it is not whitelisted, or access is allowed!
	There are still no logs from the SD card connection process on the server console.


 

Please continue investigating why the SD card is not blocked now.

Log files “LMUC1095068_2025_03_14.zip” have been uploaded to vendor website.

 

Thank you.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Hello Alin,

 

one more email I did not receive!



 

Please ensure from your side that I receive emails. Otherwise, a smooth processing is not guaranteed.

 

As testing was not possible so far, please reopen the ticket again. Testing is expected to be carried out this week.

Thank you.

Hello,

 

please do not close the ticket.

This test is not that easy to do. First, it has to be checked on which clients the affected SD card reader is integrated. And then a user of an affected client has to be contacted in the hope that they will support testing.

I will come back to you once testing has been completed.

Thank you for your understanding.

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards

Dear Christian,

As today we received a request from Management to close old tickets where a tested fix was provided, would you please allow us to close this ticket until you will have time to check it and in the eventuality the problem still persists you can easily reopen the ticket from the Support Portal?
Looking forward for your confirmation! 

Best regards,
