Hi Kundan,

You should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report about the action in question, and you can check for more info there.
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
You will need to find the policy(Either Globabl Rights, or Group Rights, COmputer,User,Device) that is denying access to it.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.

Hi Kundan,

You should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report about the action in question, and you can check for more info there.
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
You will need to find the policy(Either Globabl Rights, or Group Rights, COmputer,User,Device) that is denying access to it.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.

Thank you for your email!
This was a very good descriptive email, thank you for taking the time to write it down,much appreciated.
As far as I can tell, I do not think that the Digital Camera is blocked per say, but rather the tool that runs it,
as it seems to be a software.
1.Please, follow these steps.Try disabling the MTP feature as shown below and save it. Refresh/recheck that it was indeed disabled,
update the client and wait a bit. Retest the tool once more, if it still cannot run,try a machine reboot and retry once more.
Is iot working now?


2.If the above option must be enabled, I will let you know the steps afterwards.

Please let me kow how the step #1 goes.

Hi Kundan,

Thank you for your email!
This was a very good descriptive email, thank you for taking the time to write it down,much appreciated.
As far as I can tell, I do not think that the Digital Camera is blocked per say, but rather the tool that runs it,
as it seems to be a software.
1.Please, follow these steps.Try disabling the MTP feature as shown below and save it. Refresh/recheck that it was indeed disabled,
update the client and wait a bit. Retest the tool once more, if it still cannot run,try a machine reboot and retry once more.
Is iot working now?
[cid:image002.png@01DAB817.475A74C0]

2.If the above option must be enabled, I will let you know the steps afterwards.

Please let me kow how the step #1 goes.

Hi Kundan,

You should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report about the action in question, and you can check for more info there.
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
You will need to find the policy(Either Globabl Rights, or Group Rights, COmputer,User,Device) that is denying access to it.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.

Hi Kundan,

Thank you for your email.
Can you please provide more details please?
What server version/client version are you using?
What is the operation that you are trying to do, that is prohibited?
If this is indeed the case, you should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.


Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca

Hi Adrian,

As per your email, we have disabled MTP scanning and checked the scanner is working fine. And now we are able to access it from application.

We have made setting for particular system instead of change in Global Settings.

Hi Kundan,

Thank you for your email!
This was a very good descriptive email, thank you for taking the time to write it down,much appreciated.
As far as I can tell, I do not think that the Digital Camera is blocked per say, but rather the tool that runs it,
as it seems to be a software.
1.Please, follow these steps.Try disabling the MTP feature as shown below and save it. Refresh/recheck that it was indeed disabled,
update the client and wait a bit. Retest the tool once more, if it still cannot run,try a machine reboot and retry once more.
Is iot working now?
[cid:image004.png@01DAB81C.59AAC5D0]

2.If the above option must be enabled, I will let you know the steps afterwards.

Please let me kow how the step #1 goes.

Hi Kundan,

You should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report about the action in question, and you can check for more info there.
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
You will need to find the policy(Either Globabl Rights, or Group Rights, COmputer,User,Device) that is denying access to it.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.

Hi Kundan,


You should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report about the action in question, and you can check for more info there.
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
You will need to find the policy(Either Globabl Rights, or Group Rights, COmputer,User,Device) that is denying access to it.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.

Hi Kundan,

Thank you for your email.
Can you please provide more details please?
What server version/client version are you using?
What is the operation that you are trying to do, that is prohibited?
If this is indeed the case, you should find details on the Reports and Analysis page-Logs report
Also, try finding the device under Device Control- and right click it and go to Manage Rights.
Also, check the Global Rights from under Device Control for the Printers as per below, and make sure that they are set to allow.


Best Regards,

Adrian Stanca
