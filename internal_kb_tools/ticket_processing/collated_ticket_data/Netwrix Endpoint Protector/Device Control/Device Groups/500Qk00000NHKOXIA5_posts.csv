I appreciate your help and the questions that you have answered for me so far. My question, is the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector capable of actively scanning for devices that are not installed on the endpoint protector and have the endpoint protector installed remotely within a network?

An example of this situation would be attempting to find a device within a network given that the device is a part of the same network but does not have the Netwrix client installed on the device.

Is this a function or is this not supported?

Please contact me through email at <a href='https://daniel.madrigal@lausd.net' target='_blank'>daniel.madrigal@lausd.net</a>

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Daniel Madrigal","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-24T20:21:04.000Z"
