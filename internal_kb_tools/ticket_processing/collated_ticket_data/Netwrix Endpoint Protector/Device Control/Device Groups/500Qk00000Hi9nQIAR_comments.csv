@WaitingOnEngineer
Hi,

Please try the following steps:


	 - 	Restart services


--- CODE ---
               service mysql restart
               service php-fpm restart
               service nginx restart

--- CODE ---

     2. Delete all scheduled exports (they will need to be recreated later)

     3. Enable the debug log for the export script:


--- CODE ---
              touch /tmp/export_entities.debug
              touch /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
              chmod 777 /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
--- CODE ---

      4. Run a one time users export : Device Control-Users->Choose action->Export List of Users

      5. If the export still does not show in the List of Exports:
                               please provide us with the log file /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
                               and also check the total number of entities:

--- CODE ---
                                 select count(*) from clientuser where deleted = 0;
                                select count(*) from clientmachine where deleted = 0;
                                select count(*) from clientdevice where deleted = 0;
--- CODE ---

      6. Delete the log files:

--- CODE ---
                rm /tmp/export_entities.debug
                rm /var/log/epp/export_entities.log
--- CODE ---

      7. Recreate the scheduled exports

Thanks

We had a remote session today and ran the commands which you provided.
The issue seems to occur only when the list of computers are exported.  When we restart the EPP appliance and export the list of users then it works fine, but the moment we export the list of computers then it seems to become unresponsive and also it seems that it is also causing a blockage for other exports that follow. 

Today the EPP appliance was shut down and after it powered up we ran the commands to activate the export entities debug log, we then exported the list of users and the export was available immediately.  When we ran an export of list of computers then the exports stopped showing under ""Exported Entities""

I ran the process check list and also did a count on users, devices, computers.

Please see the screenshots in the attachments folder with today's date in file names and also see the 'export_entities.log' that was taken from the EPP Server.

Kindly advise on the next steps.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-11-11T14:01:51.000Z","2024-11-11T14:01:51.000Z","false","false"

Hi,



Thank you for the info.

Please provide some screenshots with the mysql config file   /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

We would also like to check the mysql log file:
To enable the mysql error log:

     - edit /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf



     - change log-error-verbosity to 3

     - add this line under log-error-verbosity

              log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log

     - restart service:

             service mysql restart

     - run a Computer one time export and wait a few minutes

     - !! disable the mysql error log and provide  the log file


   Can you ask the customer if there was a server upgrade or an AD sync or any event happening around 29/30 Oct (when the daily exports stopped working)?

    Did they have this number of computers prior to 29/30 Oct? Can you check a few export files and see the number of entities that were exported? Maybe compare them with the current numbers?

   For the moment , we recommend that the exports are scheduled at night (or during a time when there is low traffic) and spread them half an hour apart, so that they don't start at the same time.


Thanks

During today’s remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server. The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.

The customer confirmed that they are upgrading their operating system and that the machines are also undergoing name changes. 

They will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.

 Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Hi Andre,

Please schedule another remote session. 
The next step will be to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status). 

 !!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Please ask the customer if it’s possible to use Zoom for the remote connection.

Thanks,
Augustina

During today's remote session, we completed the following tasks:

  >> Backed up the database.
  >>  Cleaned up the clientmachine table (currently containing 55,693 machines).
  >>  Removed the deleted groups.
  >> Verified the number of users: 89,300.

We also manually executed the SQL command to export the machines. After removing the LEFT JOIN with the clientuser table, the SQL ran without issues.


The next steps:

	 - 	 Create an environment on our side that mirrors the customer's setup to replicate the problem.
	 - 	 Optimize the SQL command to ensure it runs smoothly without errors.

Please schedule another remote session.

In this remote session, we will try to clean up the clientuser table.
We have also prepared an improvement for the export entities cron. If the customer agrees, we can apply this improvement to version 5940. Additionally, the improvement will be included in the 5941 release.
