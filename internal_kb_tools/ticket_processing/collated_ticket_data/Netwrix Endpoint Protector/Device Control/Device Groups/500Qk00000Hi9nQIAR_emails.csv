Hope you are well.

 

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

Thanks for the update.
We'll discuss your recommendation you've given below internally.

So what should we do in the meantime?
Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.


Kind regards

Hi Andre

 

Hope you are well.

 

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

 

Thanks for the update.

We’ll discuss your recommendation you’ve given below internally.

 

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hope you are well.

 

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

Thanks for the update.
We'll discuss your recommendation you've given below internally.

So what should we do in the meantime?
Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Andre

Hope you are well.

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

 

Thanks for the update.

We’ll discuss your recommendation you’ve given below internally.

 

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

Thanks for the update.
We'll discuss your recommendation you've given below internally.

So what should we do in the meantime?
Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Andre

Hope you are well.

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

 

Thanks for the update.

We’ll discuss your recommendation you’ve given below internally.

 

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Thanks for the update.
We'll discuss your recommendation you've given below internally.

So what should we do in the meantime?
Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.

Hi Andre

Hope you are well.

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.


Kind regards

Hi Andre

 

Thanks for the update.

We’ll discuss your recommendation you’ve given below internally.

 

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.


Kind regards

Hi Andre

 

Hope you are well.

 

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Hi Andre

 

I think it would better that we rather set up a remote session to resolve. Please advise your availability

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update.

This message means that the system partition on the Hard Drive / Disk of your EPP Server appliance is running on low on free space, to address this we will need to schedule a remote session and check what is utilizing the space on the system partition and if necessary perform a cleanup.  In some cases the tmp folder gets full and a system reboot usually solves this issue, you can try a reboot again and see if it still persists.  If the message still persists then we will need a remote session.

As we need to keep the topics separate on support cases, can I kindly ask you to open a separate support ticket for the disk cleanup please?


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

Yes you could give it a try to reboot the EPP appliance, in the meanwhile the internal case is with our Dev team so we are waiting on their feedback.  I will inform you the moment I have received an update internally.

Hi Andre

 

Thanks for the update.

We’ll discuss your recommendation you’ve given below internally.

 

So what should we do in the meantime?

Should we reboot the system?

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you for the update, this may be because security updates for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS have reached End of Life.  We would strongly recommend that you consider migrating to a new Endpoint Protector appliance running on Ubuntu 22.04.
For the issue of the exported list of users not showing under  ""List of Exports"", the internal case is with our Dev team who will be providing feeding on this soon.


Kind regards

Hi Andre

 

Hope you are well.

 

We had a look today for the backend security updates in the Endpoint protector Netwrix console on both the security and other option, but nothing available. See snippet below from the application showing this.

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Andre

Thank you for your support thus far on this case.
We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.
We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.
We've set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.
We'll provide further feedback on Monday

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

Hi Andre

 

Thank you for your support thus far on this case. 

We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.

We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.

We’ve set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.

We’ll provide further feedback on Monday

 

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

 

Kind Regards,

Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user's report from the 11th Nov 2024.
Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.
Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user’s report from the 11th Nov 2024.

Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.

Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

 

Thank you for your support thus far on this case. 

We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.

We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.

We’ve set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.

We’ll provide further feedback on Monday

 

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

 

Kind Regards,

Shaheed

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user's report from the 11th Nov 2024.
Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.
Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

Thank you for your support thus far on this case.
We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.
We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.
We've set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.
We'll provide further feedback on Monday

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

Kind Regards,
Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status). 
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user’s report from the 11th Nov 2024.

Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.

Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

 

Thank you for your support thus far on this case. 

We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.

We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.

We’ve set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.

We’ll provide further feedback on Monday

 

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

 

Kind Regards,

Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status).
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?



Kind regards

Hi Andre

Thank you for your support thus far on this case.
We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.
We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.
We've set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.
We'll provide further feedback on Monday

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

Kind Regards,
Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

The developer who will be joining the remote session is working on a Linux machine and requesting control via webbex does not work from Linux OS, but it is okay we will find a workaround for our call tomorrow.  Could you please send myself and Adrian Draghici ( adrian.draghici@netwrix.com ) the invitation via WebEx for tomorrow at 10 AM?

Hi Shaheed,

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status). 
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?



Kind regards

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user’s report from the 11th Nov 2024.

Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.

Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

The developer who will be joining the remote session is working on a Linux machine and requesting control via webbex does not work from Linux OS, but it is okay we will find a workaround for our call tomorrow.  Could you please send myself and Adrian Draghici ( adrian.draghici@netwrix.com ) the invitation via WebEx for tomorrow at 10 AM?

Hi Shaheed,

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status).
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?



Kind regards

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user's report from the 11th Nov 2024.
Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.
Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

Thank you for your support thus far on this case.
We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.
We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.
We've set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.
We'll provide further feedback on Monday

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

Kind Regards,
Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Shaheed,

The developer who will be joining the remote session is working on a Linux machine and requesting control via webbex does not work from Linux OS, but it is okay we will find a workaround for our call tomorrow.  Could you please send myself and Adrian Draghici ( adrian.draghici@netwrix.com ) the invitation via WebEx for tomorrow at 10 AM?

Hi Shaheed,

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status). 
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?



Kind regards

Hi Adrian

 

Hope you are well.

 

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user’s report from the 11th Nov 2024.

Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.

Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

 

Thank you for your support thus far on this case. 

We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.

We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.

We’ve set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.

We’ll provide further feedback on Monday

 

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

 

Kind Regards,

Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

Hi Andre/Adrian

Hope you all are well.

Just an update from our end with regards to deleting stale user entries from the application.
We managed to delete a lot from the application - From 90k we brought the figure down 48500 user entries.

Let us know when you would like us to set up a Webex session for next week to delete the flagged data in the backend.

Thanks

Hi Shaheed,

The developer who will be joining the remote session is working on a Linux machine and requesting control via webbex does not work from Linux OS, but it is okay we will find a workaround for our call tomorrow.  Could you please send myself and Adrian Draghici ( adrian.draghici@netwrix.com ) the invitation via WebEx for tomorrow at 10 AM?

Hi Shaheed,

I would like to provide you with an update on this case.

We will need to clean up the clientmachine table. There are approximately 130,000 machines. We will attempt to remove them from the database (currently, deleted machines are only marked with a 'delete' status).
!!! A backup or snapshot should be created before starting the machine deletion process.

Our Dev team would like to know if it would be possible to use Zoom for the remote connection please?

Can we schedule a remote session for 10 AM tomorrow morning?

Hi Adrian

Hope you are well.

We checked the CoSoSys/Netwrix endpoint protector reporting task this weekend and none of the reports Clint created are appearing under exported entities. The last report showing is the user's report from the 11th Nov 2024.
Does not seem like deleting all those systems made a difference.
Please take this update back to your dev team and advise us on the way forward towards resolving this issue.

Kind Regards,

Hi Andre

Thank you for your support thus far on this case.
We have gone through the task on our end of deleting stale entries of machines under Device Control- computers section in the console.
We are currently sitting at around 54400 endpoints.
We've set the Computer export to run at 10pm tonight as suggested by your team.
We'll provide further feedback on Monday

Wish you a good weekend ahead.

Kind Regards,
Shaheed

Hi Shaheed,

Thank you or your time on our call yesterday.  Thank you also for your patience throughout our call while we enabled and set different levels of debug logs while running commands on the EPP Server's SQL database.

Our developers that were present on the call did not find errors which indicates the possible root cause for why manual list of computers exports does not complete. During our remote session, we observed an increase in the number of machines on the server, this ultimately affects the task of completing the export of the list of computers.  The total number of machines in the system that have not been deleted is 74,022, up from 71,512 at the beginning of October.  You confirmed that your organization's IT department is currently upgrading the operating system on the end user machines and that the machines are also undergoing name changes.  You stated that you will try to identify and delete any machines that are no longer in use.  Additionally, we suggested scheduling the export in the evening when the server load is lower.

Please do provide us with an update on this case after you managed to identify and delete the computer entries that are no longer in use.


Kind regards

We are replicating the environment with 48k - 90k Users, 55k computers and are doing intensive tests in order to gather more information about this issue.  This is to prevent more remote sessions where we will lose a lot of time, please bare with us until we have completed our internal tests and we will get back to you with an update after.

Hi Shaheed,

We are replicating the environment with 48k - 90k Users, 55k computers and are doing intensive tests in order to gather more information about this issue.  This is to prevent more remote sessions where we will lose a lot of time, please bare with us until we have completed our internal tests and we will get back to you with an update after.



Kind regards
