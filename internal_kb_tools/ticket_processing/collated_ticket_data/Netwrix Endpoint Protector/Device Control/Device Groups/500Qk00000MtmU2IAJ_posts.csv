We are looking to make custom device groups that can be applied in the manage rights section of the policy settings. 

We are looking to whitelist certain devices on certain machines, but we want to make a custom group of PID,VID and serial numbers to do this. 

Thanks!
Danny","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-13T17:19:07.000Z"
