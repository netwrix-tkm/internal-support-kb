We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good afternoon Denney,

Thank you for the explanation.

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

For this specific example,

Let's say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

Sincerely,

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask.

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object?

An example of this would be for example:

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result.

Thank you again for your continued support.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

Thank you again for the help!

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Thank you again for your help!

Good afternoon Denney,

Thank you for the explanation.

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

For this specific example,

Let's say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

 

Thank you again for the help!

 

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies? 

 

Thank you again for your help!

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask. 

 

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

 

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object? 

 

An example of this would be for example:

 

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result. 

 

Thank you again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

 

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object? 

 

An example of this would be for example:

 

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result. 

 

Thank you again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

Unfortunately no, the device would need to be connected to the EPP client/machine with EPP client installed in order to be read and sent/registered on the EPP server.

Good afternoon Denney,

 

Thank you for the explanation. 

 

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

 

For this specific example, 

 

Let’s say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

 

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

 

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Hi, Flaviu

Thank you for the information and clarification. I apologize for all the follow-up questions. I want to ask for some more clarification regarding the CAP. So if CAP is more for reporting and blocking instances of PII from being uploaded to the internet based on established/pre-defined rules. How can I be notified when instances of PII data are uploaded from a user's device based on the established?

Thank you again for your help.

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

Thank you again for the help!

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Thank you again for your help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):

[cid:image004.png@01DB9D66.EB69DC10]

3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:
[cid:image005.png@01DB9D66.EB69DC10]
(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

You are welcome!

You can set Alerts on the EPP server using the Alerts -> Content Aware Alerts functionality.

The first step to setup this functionality is to add your smtp information on the EPP server. This is done from System Configuration -> System Settings:


After that ""Save"" the settings and select ""Send test email to my account"" option and save again. You will get a green message on the top of the page that a test email has been sent to your email address, if everything is setup correctly. Please check your mailbox to see if you received the test email. If you have you can continue with the next steps. If not, there may be an issue with your configuration.

After that navigate to Alerts -> Content Aware Alerts and set alerts for the CAP policies you created. If the policy triggers it will send an email to your mailbox.

Please note: do not use this functionality for CAP policies that generate a lot of logs/reports or have all the computers selected. If a very large number of alerts are sent out there may be issues with processing them.

Good afternoon Denney,

 

Thank you for the explanation. 

 

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

 

For this specific example, 

 

Let’s say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

 

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

 

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good morning Netwrix Customer Support Team,

Thank you again for all of your help.

I had a question regarding the eDiscovery policy.

I am running some scans on eDiscovery policy at the moment and I noticed that there are these options regarding the actions for any hits that the eDiscovery policy finds.

[cid:image006.png@01DB9F01.CB4C98E0]

Are you able to explain to me that these functions do?

Thank you again for your help.

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

Thank you again for the help!

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Thank you again for your help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):

[cid:image004.png@01DB9F01.90032330]

3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:
[cid:image005.png@01DB9F01.90032330]
(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask.

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object?

An example of this would be for example:

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result.

Thank you again for your continued support.

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you again for your help and support. I wanted to ask another question. For the following menu items such as: Denylist and Allowlists > Denylist > Filename > Filters

How does this function work? Does this work by importing an Excel file based on file names that I would like Netwrix to flag in my search results? For example, if I have an excel sheet containing 5 different file names. Does the Netwrix scan for the file name based on the exact name of the file, or can it flag a partial name of a file?

Example:

Summary_Report_School.pdf - full name

Summary_Report_School.pdf - partial name

Once the Excel sheet has been uploaded to the file name within the deny list with a list of files, will eDiscovery flag those file names?

Thank you once again for your continued support.

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

Good morning Netwrix Customer Support Team,

Thank you again for all of your help.

I had a question regarding the eDiscovery policy.

I am running some scans on eDiscovery policy at the moment and I noticed that there are these options regarding the actions for any hits that the eDiscovery policy finds.

[cid:image003.png@01DB9FF6.70F5A6C0]

Are you able to explain to me that these functions do?

Thank you again for your help.

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):

[cid:image005.png@01DB9FF6.70F5A6C0]

3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:
[cid:image006.png@01DB9FF6.70F5A6C0]
(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask.

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object?

An example of this would be for example:

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result.

Thank you again for your continued support.

Hi Daniel,

Unfortunately no, the device would need to be connected to the EPP client/machine with EPP client installed in order to be read and sent/registered on the EPP server.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NHKOX:ref


Good afternoon Denney,

Thank you for the explanation.

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

For this specific example,

Let's say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

Sincerely,

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

 

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object? 

 

An example of this would be for example:

 

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result. 

 

Thank you again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

Unfortunately no, the device would need to be connected to the EPP client/machine with EPP client installed in order to be read and sent/registered on the EPP server.

Good afternoon Denney,

 

Thank you for the explanation. 

 

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

 

For this specific example, 

 

Let’s say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

 

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

 

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you again for your help and support. I wanted to ask another question. For the following menu items such as: Denylist and Allowlists > Denylist > Filename > Filters

 

How does this function work? Does this work by importing an Excel file based on file names that I would like Netwrix to flag in my search results? For example, if I have an excel sheet containing 5 different file names. Does the Netwrix scan for the file name based on the exact name of the file, or can it flag a partial name of a file?

 

Example:

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – full name

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – partial name 

 

Once the Excel sheet has been uploaded to the file name within the deny list with a list of files, will eDiscovery flag those file names?

 

Thank you once again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

Good morning Netwrix Customer Support Team,

 

Thank you again for all of your help.

 

I had a question regarding the eDiscovery policy. 

 

I am running some scans on eDiscovery policy at the moment and I noticed that there are these options regarding the actions for any hits that the eDiscovery policy finds.

 



 

Are you able to explain to me that these functions do? 

 

Thank you again for your help.

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

 

Thank you for the clarification. 

 

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying. 

 

I was hoping to set up those “and” rules instead of “or” rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

 

Thank you all for your support and help!

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

 

Thank you again for the help!

 

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies? 

 

Thank you again for your help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):



3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:

(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for your support you can close the ticket. In meanwhile I do have one more question. I managed to perform some eDiscovery scans and I noticed when attempting to load all results (with 2000+ hits) based on the eDiscovery policy, the tab crashes. Meanwhile, I am able to load 500 results at a time. Is there a way to resolve this or what would you recommend?

Thank you again.

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

Thank you again for the help!

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Thank you again for your help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):

[cid:image005.png@01DBA3DE.C95A5810]

3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:
[cid:image006.png@01DBA3DE.C95A5810]
(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask.

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object?

An example of this would be for example:

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result.

Thank you again for your continued support.

Good afternoon Denney,

Thank you for the explanation.

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

For this specific example,

Let's say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

If you are referring to the  eDiscovery -> Scan Results and Actions -> Show -> All, this is somehow an expected result. if all the results are displayed on the same page and they are over 500 this may cause performance issues on the EPP server part. The default setting is usually set to 20 - 50 results per page.

A best practice recommendation is to use a smaller value and look through the next pages that are generated, or use the Filters functionality in order to refine the search/items you are looking for:

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you for your support you can close the ticket. In meanwhile I do have one more question. I managed to perform some eDiscovery scans and I noticed when attempting to load all results (with 2000+ hits) based on the eDiscovery policy, the tab crashes. Meanwhile, I am able to load 500 results at a time. Is there a way to resolve this or what would you recommend? 

 

Thank you again.

 

Sincerely,

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you again for your help and support. I wanted to ask another question. For the following menu items such as: Denylist and Allowlists > Denylist > Filename > Filters

 

How does this function work? Does this work by importing an Excel file based on file names that I would like Netwrix to flag in my search results? For example, if I have an excel sheet containing 5 different file names. Does the Netwrix scan for the file name based on the exact name of the file, or can it flag a partial name of a file?

 

Example:

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – full name

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – partial name 

 

Once the Excel sheet has been uploaded to the file name within the deny list with a list of files, will eDiscovery flag those file names?

 

Thank you once again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

 

For this specific example, 

 

Let’s say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

 

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

 

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.

Good morning Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the information and I appreciate all my questions being answered. I do have one other question.

Is there a deployment guide for rolling out the endpoint protector through apple JAMF? Also, I attempted to rollout the client installer through Intune based on provided documentation from a previous email with support but unfortunately, I do not see the devices under Device Control > Computers. I am also experiencing a similar issue when pushing the Apple installer through JAMF. Are there some troubleshooting steps that you can recommend I would do for JAMF and Intune?

Thank you again for your time.

Hi Daniel,

If you are referring to the  eDiscovery -> Scan Results and Actions -> Show -> All, this is somehow an expected result. if all the results are displayed on the same page and they are over 500 this may cause performance issues on the EPP server part. The default setting is usually set to 20 - 50 results per page.

A best practice recommendation is to use a smaller value and look through the next pages that are generated, or use the Filters functionality in order to refine the search/items you are looking for:

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for your support you can close the ticket. In meanwhile I do have one more question. I managed to perform some eDiscovery scans and I noticed when attempting to load all results (with 2000+ hits) based on the eDiscovery policy, the tab crashes. Meanwhile, I am able to load 500 results at a time. Is there a way to resolve this or what would you recommend?

Thank you again.

If you setup a list of File Names and add that list/dictionary to the eDiscovery policy, it will scan the files on the computer for the exact names from the list/dictionary you provided.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you again for your help and support. I wanted to ask another question. For the following menu items such as: Denylist and Allowlists > Denylist > Filename > Filters

How does this function work? Does this work by importing an Excel file based on file names that I would like Netwrix to flag in my search results? For example, if I have an excel sheet containing 5 different file names. Does the Netwrix scan for the file name based on the exact name of the file, or can it flag a partial name of a file?

Example:

Summary_Report_School.pdf - full name

Summary_Report_School.pdf - partial name

Once the Excel sheet has been uploaded to the file name within the deny list with a list of files, will eDiscovery flag those file names?

Thank you once again for your continued support.

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

Good morning Netwrix Customer Support Team,

Thank you again for all of your help.

I had a question regarding the eDiscovery policy.

I am running some scans on eDiscovery policy at the moment and I noticed that there are these options regarding the actions for any hits that the eDiscovery policy finds.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA46C.7A6208F0]

Are you able to explain to me that these functions do?

Thank you again for your help.

Hi Daniel,

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

Thank you for the clarification.

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying.

I was hoping to set up those ""and"" rules instead of ""or"" rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

Thank you all for your support and help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

Thank you again for the help!

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies?

Thank you again for your help!

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):

[cid:image006.png@01DBA46C.7A6208F0]

3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:
[cid:image007.png@01DBA46C.7A6208F0]
(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask.

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object?

An example of this would be for example:

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result.

Thank you again for your continued support.

I managed to perform some eDiscovery scans and I noticed when attempting to load all results (with 2000+ hits) based on the eDiscovery policy, the tab crashes. Meanwhile, I am able to load 500 results at a time. Is there a way to resolve this or what would you recommend? 

 

Thank you again.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

If you setup a list of File Names and add that list/dictionary to the eDiscovery policy, it will scan the files on the computer for the exact names from the list/dictionary you provided.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you again for your help and support. I wanted to ask another question. For the following menu items such as: Denylist and Allowlists > Denylist > Filename > Filters

 

How does this function work? Does this work by importing an Excel file based on file names that I would like Netwrix to flag in my search results? For example, if I have an excel sheet containing 5 different file names. Does the Netwrix scan for the file name based on the exact name of the file, or can it flag a partial name of a file?

 

Example:

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – full name

 

Summary_Report_School.pdf – partial name 

 

Once the Excel sheet has been uploaded to the file name within the deny list with a list of files, will eDiscovery flag those file names?

 

Thank you once again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

After the eDiscovery scan finished and it returned the items that you were scanning for, it gives you those options:
1. Encrypt on target - encrypt that file on the end users computer.
2. Decrypt on target - decrypt the file, if it was previously.
3. Delete on target - delete the file from the end users computer.

Note: you don't have to choose any of these options, they are just there if you would like to perform these actions.

The use case is the following: If you scan for sensitive information and find that on a computer there are documents with sensitive information, but they should not have these documents on that computer(example: credit card numbers on an interns computer, or IT department; if they were on Account Payable computer - it would be okay as they may use it in day to day activities) then you can choose one of those actions mentioned above in order to prevent that user from using that file(encrypt or delete options).

Good morning Netwrix Customer Support Team,

 

Thank you again for all of your help.

 

I had a question regarding the eDiscovery policy. 

 

I am running some scans on eDiscovery policy at the moment and I noticed that there are these options regarding the actions for any hits that the eDiscovery policy finds.

 



 

Are you able to explain to me that these functions do? 

 

Thank you again for your help.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

Unfortunately they can only be applied individually as an OR(not AND). This is because eDiscovery does not have the Content Detection functionality:

Hello Netwrix Support Team

 

Thank you for the clarification. 

 

Is there a way to apply those previous steps to the eDiscovery policy? I apologize for any confusion and for not clarifying. 

 

I was hoping to set up those “and” rules instead of “or” rules with the eDiscovery policies to scan for PII data based on the previously stated conditions with my regex expressions.

 

Thank you all for your support and help!

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

The CAP and eDiscovery modules serve different functionalities:
1. CAP - reports and/or blocks uploads containing sensitive information to the internet.
2. eDiscovery - scans computers for specific information or file types.

If you want to monitor and/or block content from being uploaded to the internet you can use the CAP module, without the eDiscovery module.

Good morning Netwrix Team,

 

Thank you again for the help!

 

A follow-up question about setting up the CAP policy. So once the CAP policies have been set up based on the regex expressions incorporating AND results instead of OR. Will the scans within the policies and scans only scan for results based on the CAP expressions or will further configuration be needed inside of the eDiscovery policies? 

 

Thank you again for your help! 

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

You are welcome!

You could try the following:

1. After configuring the Regex Expressions, please create a new CAP policy.
2. Only select these 2 regexes as Policy Denylist(below is an example):



3. Save the CAP policy.
4. Re-open the CAP policy and got to the Content Detection Summary and make the below configuration with AND instead of the OR logical operator:

(You can also set thresholds here, if needed)

5. Save.

If you are not using Regex, and using our PII predefined content, you can do the exact same steps and replace the Regexs from the example with the PII Predefined Content.

Please let me know if this helps.

Good afternoon Netwrix Support Team,

 

Thank you for the clarification and response. I had another question on the side I wanted to ask. 

 

Within the Denylist and Allowlist section of the software, I have 8 regular expressions added to the Denylist. I understand that each scan, it will mark each individual object as an individual trigger for the scan.

 

Would it be possible to set up a trigger for the scan based on if it meets 2 out of the 8 regex expressions or more and count that as one object? 

 

An example of this would be for example:

 

A scan would trigger a result if it detects instances of an SSN and an ID number from the United States and counts that as one result. 

 

Thank you again for your continued support.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

Unfortunately no, the device would need to be connected to the EPP client/machine with EPP client installed in order to be read and sent/registered on the EPP server.

Good afternoon Denney,

 

Thank you for the explanation. 

 

I think what I wanted to ask specifically or if I may rephrase the question is would the DLP endpoint protector be able to scan devices that have never had the endpoint protector installed on them or had any interaction with the DLP software?

 

For this specific example, 

 

Let’s say I am accessing the Netwrix DLP portal on my device and I have a list of devices that have the client installed. However, there are multiple devices within the same network that have never interacted with the DLP endpoint protector. Does the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector come equipped with any tools or features to remotely scan for devices on the network that have never interacted with Netwrix or had the client software installed?

 

I have been tasked with attempting to find a server on the same network using the DLP endpoint protector remotely and scan for the system remotely and this server has never interacted with the Netwrix DLP endpoint protector.

 

I hope this clarifies the question I am attempting to ask.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Daniel,

We hope you are well.

The EPP client reads the devices and information from Device Manager and send it to the EPP server. If for example a specific device was connected at one point to a computer with the EPP client installed, and that EPP client communicated to the EPP server then that device will appear on the EPP server, with the last computer seen/connected the one that had the EPP client installed on it. If the device is removed from that computer and connected to another computer which doesn't have the EPP client installed, then it will still appear on the EPP server, but it will only show it as last connected to the computer that had the EPP client installed(which communicated to the EPP server). There will be fields with dates when it was last seen on the EPP client and on the EPP server.

In your example the device will appear on the EPP server, but it will not show you were it is connected now, it will only show you that X time ago it was connected to a computer that had the EPP client installed and it communicated with the EPP server.

Please let me know if this answered your question.
