Hello,

 

with „Bluetooth other“ device type setting “Allow Access” the external Bluetooth devices are working as expected.

--> see vendor ticket 425477.

 

Should the device type setting be deleted, and the Bluetooth device whitelisted again for requested testing?

Have any changes been made from your side?

 

Please let me know.

Thank you.

Hello,

the following tickets should not be mixed:

  *   00425477: Local device type settings are no longer functional.
As already mentioned in email from Di 05.11.2024 10:23 on computer LPTP2045733 the workaround, that means the local device type setting is still not working!
It is not possible to connect the Bluetooth headset with the computer.
  *   00425563: Whitelisting device type ""Bluetooth other"" does not work.
As the local device type setting (workaround) is still not working whitelisting the Bluetooth other device (headset) is still not functional on computer LPTP2045733 either!
From my point of view, it should not matter whether the setting was renewed or not. This was only done to possibly restore functionality. Once the setting has been set, it must also work. Now the setting is not working, and the question remains why this is the case.
Some log files have already been uploaded to the ticket in this regard.
At the moment, the one user with computer LPTP2045733 simply cannot be helped. That is why I am asking for a solution.

Thank you!

________________________________
Hello Christian,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00425563. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00425563
Ticket Subject: Whitelisting device type ""Bluetooth other"" does not work.
Ticket Details: Issue:
There are an increasing number of Bluetooth devices that do not work even though they have been whitelisted.
These are mainly devices that are recognized as device type ""Bluetooth other"".

Analysis:
- If a device is paired with the computer, an error message appears after pairing, which, depending on the device, is:
""The connected device was blocked.""
- After the VIP, PID and SN have been determined from the log files, with VID and PID usually having zero, the device is whitelisted locally accordingly. However, it is still not functional after pairing.

Workaround:
If the corresponding device type ""Bluetooth other"" is set to ""Allow Access"", the device has worked in the meantime. At the moment, this workaround no longer works either.

Result:
The affected external devices cannot be used because neither the device whitelisting nor the workaround work.

Examples:
1. Jabra Evolve2 65 Headset
EM: see screenhsot ""<a href='https://EM_device_LPTP2071835.jpg' target='_blank'>EM_device_LPTP2071835.jpg</a>"" attached.
Clientname: LPTP2071835
Special feature:
In this case, the headset is not mentioned in the error message, but an unknown device: Microsoft Bluetooth Device
Result:
Despite the release of the headset and the Microsoft device, no functionality could be established.
Hint:
- Device is only displayed in the EPP client as long as the error message does not appear.
- Server logs are generally not available at the moment.
- SN was determined from the log files.

2. PT-E560BT_HARY/Microsoft Bluetooth printer
Clientname: B2011617

3. Bluetooth speaker
EM: see screenhsot ""<a href='https://EM_device_LPTP2054172.jpg' target='_blank'>EM_device_LPTP2054172.jpg</a>"" attached.
Clientname: LPTP2054172
Result:
Despite the release of the speaker, no functionality could be established.
Hint:
- Device is only displayed in the EPP client as long as the error message does not appear.
- Server logs are generally not available at the moment.
- SN was determined from the log files.

Logfiles to investigate have been attached.

Thank you!
