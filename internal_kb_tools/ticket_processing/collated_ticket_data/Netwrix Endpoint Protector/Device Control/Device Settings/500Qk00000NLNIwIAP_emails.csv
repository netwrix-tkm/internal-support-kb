As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As we saw during the remote session, the device entries count did not increase significantly, therefore we believe the issue was sorted out.

Also, in regards of your inquiry related to:

ADV-2025-010 - Insufficient Computational Complexity in Key Derivation in Netwrix Endpoint Protector - Endpoint Protector / Security Advisories - Netwrix Community


This is related to the update to the next EPP Server version 5.9.4.2.



You can try to update the server to the latest by going to Dashboard ->Live Update->Check now and see if the patch is available, if not then it means it might take a while for it to be implemented.

As of right now since you are on 5.9.4.1 which is the latest official release, you are covered.

Let me know if you have further questions.
