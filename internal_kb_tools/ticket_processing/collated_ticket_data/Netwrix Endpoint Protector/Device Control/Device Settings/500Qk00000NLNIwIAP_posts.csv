We have noticed printer devices are being added over 10,000 times at a time as duplicate entries and is overcrowding the console, is there anything we can do about this?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T10:35:27.000Z"

We checked again the network printers and they were still at 43K as shown in the uploaded screenshot.

Seems like the newly added entries in the list were showing up with no user and Daniel found the following:


The event having ""noUser"" is generated when EppClient service is starting, but there is no user logged in yet. Hence, any events during the period between the service starting and any user logging in will have a ""noUser"" indication. 
It looks like the events are generated when EppClient service stops abruptly, but then it starts on a different day, usually this is due a force power off or a power outage.

""noUser"" is the user linked to all events performed while no user was logged into the computer. Remote usersâ€™ names who log into the computer will not be logged and their events will be stored as events of noUser. Another occurrence of noUser events would be to have an automated script/software which accesses a device when no user is logged in to the specific computer.

Explained the above to the client and they understood, which would explain why the number of entries did not increase.
Agreed to keep the ticket opened and we will do a follow up on Friday to check if the number increased.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-01T13:12:37.000Z"

There were no significant differences between Tuesday and now(only increased with 100 device entries) and neither the total amount.

Also Harry got this mail from the netwrix security team as he is a client:

https://community.netwrix.com/t/adv-2025-010-insufficient-computational-complexity-in-key-derivation-in-netwrix-endpoint-protector/5299

Seems like they've already got notifications about upgrading to 5.9.4.2 version.

Will send a follow up note.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-04T12:25:53.000Z"
