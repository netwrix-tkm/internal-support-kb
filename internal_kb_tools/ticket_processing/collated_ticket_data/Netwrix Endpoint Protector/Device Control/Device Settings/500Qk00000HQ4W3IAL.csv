"500Qk00000HQ4W3IAL","00424919","Support Ticket","ADB Access Issues and Samsung Smartphone Recognition Questions","I set ADB to ""Deny access"" in Device Control, but when I click ""Use"" on the smartphone connected to the PC in Device Manager, ADB becomes accessible. Is this also a simple error?

To summarize:

1. Device Control -> ADB -> Deny access
2. Device Manager -> Click ""Use"" on the smartphone connected to the PC -> ADB becomes accessible
3. After rebooting, it is blocked again.

Please refer to the attached file

I understand that Samsung smartphones can be detected in three different ways.
When debugging is enabled, the connected device is displayed as 'SAMSUNG Electronics Co., Ltd/SAMSUNG Android ADB Interface.' However, why is it shown as 'Galaxy series, misc. (MTP mode)' instead?","","","","fixed","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","","","90.0","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Solution","Seong Yun Jeong","2024-10-24T07:34:05.000Z","2025-01-22T07:58:14.000Z"
