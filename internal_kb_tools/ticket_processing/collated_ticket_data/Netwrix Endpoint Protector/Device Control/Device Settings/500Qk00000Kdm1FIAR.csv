But after removing EPP agent from the computer, all works fine. Which of the options can impact to the ISO file?","","In the meeting we have performed the following steps : 
verified how the issue is reproducing 
stop the MTP scanning
restart the eppclient
start the EPP logs
no process name was recorded when the iso is mounted
change the device control rights to allow all devices and that fix the issue
we have allowed only for CD and DVD and unknown devices and we solve the issue
As we agreed please update the server version and then please use the offline patch to generate the new client version and check if the issue is reproducible.","Wait for the customer to test","fixed","","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","","","13.1","Closed - Resolved","IPRO SIA","Elena Revzina","2025-01-15T12:33:22.000Z","2025-01-28T13:49:09.000Z"
