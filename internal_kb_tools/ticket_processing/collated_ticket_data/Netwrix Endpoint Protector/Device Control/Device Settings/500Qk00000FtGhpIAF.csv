"500Qk00000FtGhpIAF","00421292","Support Ticket","Bluetooth log noise","We are looking through our EPP client logs on our Linux endpoints, and there is a large amount of noise surrounding Bluetooth. With Bluetooth blocked on our managed rights, the Linux machines are constantly generating logs that say ""Failed to stop bluetooth.service: Unit bluetooth service not loaded"". The Linux machines do not have Bluetooth installed.

Is there any way to fix this issue with the client trying to block something that is not even installed on the client? Maybe it can check to see if Bluetooth is installed before trying to block it? 

Thank you","","this issue is caused by the missing process for Bluetooth which is normal since they do not use it so it was never installed.
R&D will fix this in the next server version, which is 5.9.4.1","the customer will install the new server version when it comes out and will open a new case if the issue returns","fix will be available in 5.9.4.1 based on R&D","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","","","82.9","Closed - Resolved","Motorola Solutions Inc","Joe Cutter","2024-09-17T17:45:13.000Z","2024-12-09T15:28:17.000Z"
