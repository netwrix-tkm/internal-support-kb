Unfortunately that timeframe is already blocked for another remote session that was upfront scheduled. My team members also have meetings from then, as I thought I might find someone to help you today.
I am afraid that the earliest we could schedule a session would be tomorrow. We are available tomorrow from: 11:00, 12:00 or 13:00 UK time.

Looking forward to see if any of the timeslots proposed for tomorrow would be suitable so I can send you a calendar invite.

Hi John,

Unfortunately that timeframe is already blocked for another remote session that was upfront scheduled. My team members also have meetings from then, as I thought I might find someone to help you today.
I am afraid that the earliest we could schedule a session would be tomorrow. We are available tomorrow from: 11:00, 12:00 or 13:00 UK time.

Looking forward to see if any of the timeslots proposed for tomorrow would be suitable so I can send you a calendar invite.

Hi John,

Unfortunately that timeframe is already blocked for another remote session that was upfront scheduled. My team members also have meetings from then, as I thought I might find someone to help you today.
I am afraid that the earliest we could schedule a session would be tomorrow. We are available tomorrow from: 11:00, 12:00 or 13:00 UK time.

Looking forward to see if any of the timeslots proposed for tomorrow would be suitable so I can send you a calendar invite.

Hi John,

Unfortunately that timeframe is already blocked for another remote session that was upfront scheduled. My team members also have meetings from then, as I thought I might find someone to help you today.
I am afraid that the earliest we could schedule a session would be tomorrow. We are available tomorrow from: 11:00, 12:00 or 13:00 UK time.

Looking forward to see if any of the timeslots proposed for tomorrow would be suitable so I can send you a calendar invite.

Best regards,
