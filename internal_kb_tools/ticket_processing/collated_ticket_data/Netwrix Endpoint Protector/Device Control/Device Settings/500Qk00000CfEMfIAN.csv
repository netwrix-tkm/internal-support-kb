"500Qk00000CfEMfIAN","00414045","Support Ticket","delete Devices objects","hello,
this is the message our client Ministery French Defense center : 
We are experiencing some very strange behaviour with some users. A key is associated with them and authorised in the console, but the local agent blocks it even after a forced re-read of the policies. The solution of deleting the key from the console and recreating it usually solves this problem;

Given this state of affairs, yesterday I launched a rereading of the configurations via the interface, which caused an ""internal server error 500"" for several hours....
This morning the console is up and running.
After this bad and stressful experience, we can see that the database is enormous. It seems that the database contains more than 200,000,000 objects.
We want to be able to delete Devices objects that have not been seen for x months/years by the console.
or

We want to be able to delete Users objects that have not been seen for x months/years by the console.
or
We want to be able to delete Machine objects that have not been seen for x months/years by the console.
Unless I'm mistaken, the interface doesn't allow this type of action to be performed automatically.
You can select devices, but the selection only displays a maximum of 1,000 objects in the console, filtered by the ""last seen"". (users, machines, devices)
Do you know if there's a clean solution for purging our database on a regular basis?","","","","Case continued on 00414133 as it is a duplicate now","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","IP Steel","Luc VANTROOST","2024-07-04T07:34:30.000Z","2024-07-05T11:16:25.000Z"
