Hi ,

This is probably a performance issue.

Please check the load average, CPU, memory usage while filtering the computers list.
Also, run :
 

--- CODE ---
       show full processlist;
--- CODE ---

while filtering the computer list.

Optimizing the server, improving the server resources should solve the problem.

While optimizing the server you can increase the php memory_limit (not too much) and optimize the mysql config.

If the issue persists, please send us all the information above, plus the result of this query:


--- CODE ---           select count(*) from clientmachine;
--- CODE ---

Thanks

Hi,

To increase also the PHP memory limit:

    vim /usr/local/lib/php.ini
    Search after memory_limit, and set its value to 512M.
    Save the changes and restart the PHP and MySQL services:
        service php-fpm restart
        service mysql restart
Thank you
