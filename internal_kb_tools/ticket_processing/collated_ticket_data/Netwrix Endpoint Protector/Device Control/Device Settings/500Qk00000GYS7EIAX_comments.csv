@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hello,
We don't support IBM architecture.
We have builds for RHEL.
What exactly do they what to know about hashing?

Our product may use different hashing algorithms for different purposes.
Can you please clarify what exactly are you interested in finding out?

I checked with the customer and only have the Device Control module and would like to be sure which hashing algorithm is used when saving files to a flash drive. Are there other less obvious hashing functions within the device control module?

Please advise.

@WaitingOnEngineer 
I'm still not sure what exactly is the question.
In what scenario are we hashing a file saved to a flash drive? Or are they referring to encryption with EasyLock?

@WaitingOnEngineer 

	 - 	By it's nature hashing is used to ""uniquely"" identify files, as it's a fixed length ""unique"" digest of data stream. But we don't save hashes of files to flash drives. Are you referring to encryption used with EasyLock?
	 - 	EPP may uses various hashing algorithms for different purposes.
