We have figured out that USB adapters serials are being picked up, but not the drive (external, flash drives, Sata drives etc) that is attached to it, this is an issue. is there a method we can use to view & probably block drives attached to adapters in this manner, this would make moving data outside the network very easy (if others knew this)","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-06T15:11:34.000Z"
