Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you please confirm the Epp server and client version this is happening on?

You mentioned it was after the client upgrade. Can you please try to uninstall it and install the client version 6.2.2.1 manually to see if the issue remains?

For the BSOD can you collect the dump file for it?

We can also collect a set of client logs using the steps below.

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
4.c. Select Create Extended logs and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Restart the computer.
7. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
8. Wait a fe minutes
9. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
10. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards
