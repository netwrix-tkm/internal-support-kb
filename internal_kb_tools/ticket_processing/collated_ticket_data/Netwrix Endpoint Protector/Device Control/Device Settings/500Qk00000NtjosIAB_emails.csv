Hi Kunal,

Thank you for your time on our call earlier today.  In our call we discovered that the renewal license was not applied to your Endpoint Protector Server.

Upon checking internally with our Customer Success team, I was informed that the license was shared with you on kkhosti@measureone.com via on 29th October 2024.

I have shared the license with you again, please follow the link: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/CustomerSupportFiles/EQ1gMLZdhYdJmM7qcozaXxEBTsliPGVV67-TluyJohNHQA?email=kkoshti%40measureone.com&e=Gp8KkG

Please import the license into the EPP Server as discussed in our call and please let us know if it applied successfully with the modules now showing ""Active"" status.



Kind regards
