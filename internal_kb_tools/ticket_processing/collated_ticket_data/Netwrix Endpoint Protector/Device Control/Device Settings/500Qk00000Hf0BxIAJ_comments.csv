Please ask the customer to recheck again as the licensing issue may have impacted this.

Also please provide a list of devices that are affected and client logs

Some Logs have been uploaded in the attachment folder. These logs are before and after whitelisting external devices.

After checking you will be informed, if reproducing the issue is possible from our side.

The licensing issue may have not impacted this behavior, as according to @Markus.Durst@netwrix.com (29/10/2024), 20.000 additional licenses have been activated free of charge today.

However, the view on the Endpoint Protector server is still incorrect (see screenshot from the Licensing section)","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-10-30T14:16:47.000Z","2024-10-30T14:16:47.000Z","false","false"

Please set up a remote connection,
Please make sure that there will be access to a computer where this issue is encountered. 
The ideal scenario will be to have this issue replicated in their staging environment.

it is not possible to reproduce the issue in the staging environment. I also tried without success.

I contacted one of the affected users to have a remote session. His time slot is today between 10:00 a.m. and 01:00 p.m. CET.

PS. I (Alin) will not be available today between 12:45 and 13:30 RO time.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-10-31T08:25:21.000Z","2024-10-31T08:25:21.000Z","false","false"

We were connected together with Alin and Robert and found out that they have set the rights on different computer while one node was down, and because of this the problem occurred. We explained them that whenever they encounter some issue similar to this to disable and enable the right again. They seem to be ok to do this. We checked the backend for 8 computers and Alin will ask them to resave the rights only for 2 computers. For other computers that were in the similar situation we added the rights manually.

@Mihaela Benta I would expect rights to work without customer intervention after fail over? Can we discuss at next standup quickly please.

after consultation with the users, the workaround works on affected computers.
 
Exception:
On computer LPTP2045733 the setting is still not working!
It is not possible to connect the Bluetooth headset with the computer.
 
Analysis:
Connection to the server is fine and policy update was successful.

 
Please investigate again from your side. If additional information is needed, come back to me.
 
Hint:
The workaround is only used because whitelisting “Bluetooth other” devices is not working.
