Can we get support on how to improve this and deleted some stored data and unneeded backups etc.? I have tried but some things are not deleting. We have reports that the portal is taking longer to access and performance if effected.

Message: ""Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 6.61 gb free available from 19.52 gb (34%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.""
