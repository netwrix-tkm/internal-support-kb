We have noticed printer devices are being added over 10,000 times at a time as duplicate entries and is overcrowding the console, is there anything we can do about this?","","Connected remote with Harry to take a look at the entries.

There were no significant differences between Tuesday and now(only increased with 100 device entries) and neither the total amount.

Also Harry got this mail from the netwrix security team as he is a client:

Seems like they've already got notifications about upgrading to 5.9.4.2 version.

Will send a follow up note.","Will sent a follow up note with the answer.","Issue solved after removing the duplicates.","","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","NONE","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Publica Group Ltd.","Harry Chew","2025-03-26T10:35:25.000Z","2025-04-08T10:51:19.000Z"
