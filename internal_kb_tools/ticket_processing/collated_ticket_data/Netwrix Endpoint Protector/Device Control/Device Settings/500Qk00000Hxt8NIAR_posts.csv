The computer appeared as Licensed and Offline.

Issue:
In the Device Computer -> Computers -> Filter menu: if we select in the Duplicates field ""Yes"" and apply, the page will keep loading till it times out.
I tried replicating this issue on my end(but I do not have duplicate computers) and it loaded instantly returning 0 computers.","","","","005Qk000001nViKIAU","2025-01-10T19:09:19.000Z"
