Did the customer update to 5.9.4.0 and retest the issue?

I have updated the EPP server with the customer, but the situation persist.

The shadows are not generated, we performed the test on the dlptest.enpointprotector.com 

The logs and the screenshot has been attached,","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-10-11T10:04:29.000Z","2024-10-11T10:04:29.000Z","false","false"

Hello,
We saw that the policy has a File size threshold of 1 (MB).
So the policy will only trigger for file sizes bigger than 1MB.
But the default Max file size shadowing is 512KB (under Computer Settings).
We're guessing that's why shadows are note generated.

We've also noticed from the logs that the file sent to dlptest is not being scanned/hashed after the first send attempt.
This can be because it's been downloaded and it's skipped from scanning as a technical limitation.
If it's not being hashed it will not be shadowed.

Also, because the file is being hashed after the first send attempt, the shadow of the file will probably be sent only on a previous attempt that is recognized as a separate event; as subsequent events from the same browser session will use a cached response and will not be reported.
