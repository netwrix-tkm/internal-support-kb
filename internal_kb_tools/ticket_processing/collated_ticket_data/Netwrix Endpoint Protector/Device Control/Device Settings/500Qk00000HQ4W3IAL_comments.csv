Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

I noticed in one image from the attachments that this issue is on Windows.

Please use the following link to download the latest 5.9.4.1 agent: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp08112024/EppClient_v6.2.4.1003.zip

Please be aware that this should be treated as a test build and only installed on a couple of machines for testing purposes.

Regards,
Cristi

Customer returned that they would like to know what is causing this bug. 
Also they mentioned that before entering adb commands in cmd, blocking actions work well even when enabling the device in Device Manager. However, after entering a command in cmd and then enabling the device in Device Manager, the blocking no longer works.","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2024-11-19T12:49:49.000Z","2024-11-19T12:49:49.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer
Regarding this case, if I’m not mistaken, the customer confirmed that the solution was delivered and that the latest build is working as expected.

Can you confirm if the latest agent is working as expected?


What was fixed/observed?
For device control, the EPP agent tracks more GUIDs, services, device classes, etc. With all these information information and others, the agent can categorize devices into different types.

It seems that starting with a certain Windows version, the ADB interface classes were changed, causing Windows to detect the device differently. After investigating the issue, we found that Windows detected the device as a custom class.
After executing some ADB commands in CMD (or push Android application to phone), an additional interface was detected ( as you mentioned, everything worked UNTIL the commands were executed in CMD).
