We should get on a quick call ASAP to discuss.

PCs are so drastically slow that it is impossible to do anything with them when they have the issue. We have a couple of laptops blue screening and the message is mentioning a driver realted to Endpoint Protector.:
  
So just in case the two issues (extreme slowness and BSODs) were related I tried booting from a build key and renaming the ""C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector"" folder on a laptop with the speed issue. After reboot issue disappeared.

Also, on one of the blue screening laptops (Brian McDonagh's) I renamed the ""C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector"" same as above. After reboot blue screen occurred again. So I booted off build key again and renamed the driver file above (C:WindowsSystem32Drivers<a href='https://cssdlp20.sys' target='_blank'>cssdlp20.sys</a>) to <a href='https://cssdlp20.sys.old' target='_blank'>cssdlp20.sys.old</a>. After reboot it didn't blue screen. It's been on for about 20 minutes with no apparent issue.","","","","Resolved.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","NONE","","124.9","Closed - Resolved","Kerry Group Services International Limited","Dylan Hennigan","2024-06-20T16:01:59.000Z","2024-10-23T12:26:41.000Z"
