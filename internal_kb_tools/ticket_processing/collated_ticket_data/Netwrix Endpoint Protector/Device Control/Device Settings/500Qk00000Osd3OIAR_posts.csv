We would like to enable automatic encryption for all USB devices across the organization, we do have a specific use case or question maybe.

We would still USB devices to be blocked by default, only once the device is whitelisted encryption should be pushed to the USB device by default. Would this be possible? If so, could you please explain what settings should be changed.

Also does automatic encryption impact banking security tokens? This should not be impacted correct?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-07T08:47:23.000Z"

Connected remote with Jovan and Nikola to take a look at the issue.
After the initial response, they eventually got the rule to workout accordingly and wanted to have this deployed for multiple users so I showed them they can either deploy it to groups or multiple computers/users.
The client was satisfied with the solution.
They also asked on how to delete the EPP from multiple devices from a specific location.
Given that the filters are not helping much the client I suggested either to use a 3rd party tool to uninstall or alternatively to use the location option from computer info and filter it in the ''Client Uninstall'' but that would require to add the location on all 100 and something devices they have.

Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-09T09:32:35.000Z"
