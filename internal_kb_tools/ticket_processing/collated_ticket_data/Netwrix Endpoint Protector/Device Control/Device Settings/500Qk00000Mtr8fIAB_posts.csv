end user ARTE TV FRENCH
WMWARE 17 player hosts VM endpoint Unbuntu 18.04.6
The OS hosting the VMware is a WIN 10 PRO 20H2
SERVER ID: 9VYHCB6T
endpoint version: 5.6.00

The console indicates an end of license 12/23 (?)
Which is wrong, because the license ran until December 2024.
We had taken out a 3-year subscription (until the end of 2025, I believe).


It's true that I hadn't been on the Endpoint console for a while and I delayed putting the license Fabienne sent me in December 2025, but I'm sure it was working at the end of 2024 because I had opened rights for a hard disk around November.

cOULD YOU CHECK PLEASE,and have an update
Best
