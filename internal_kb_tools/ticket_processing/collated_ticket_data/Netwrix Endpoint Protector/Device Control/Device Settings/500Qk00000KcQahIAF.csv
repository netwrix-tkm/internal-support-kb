Recently we migrated to Group level settings from custom settings for our endpoints in the DLP console.

We didn't make any new changes and made sure that Group settings have the same settings as each host has, despite the successful transition. We noticed that DPI settings hows ON in the console but when we checked on the computer on the EPP Client it showed disabled.

Now this is very strange that DPI shows ON in console and on the client it shows disabled.

Can you please help us in this case? What can be done to resolve this?

Thanks,
Parin","","Unfortunately we could not reproduce the issue with Custom Computer Settings not reverting to Group Settings once Restore to Global Settings was selected.

Currently our tests on your end and my end seemed to work as intended: Restoring a Custom Computer -> received Settings From the Computer Group it is part of, instead of Global Settings.","Chased with customer.
