Daniel, please let me know when we could either set a meeting to gather the logs or if you want to gather them, just attach them using the ticketing portal to make sure they arrive properly.
The logs should contain a fair number of logs, caused by Bluetooth, that are noise.

Hello Joe,

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding the files we need from you. Once you have the files ready, you can easily upload them to our Customer Portal at www.netwrix.com/support.

If you’re experiencing any issues with the upload or need further assistance, please let me know—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00421292
Ticket Subject: Bluetooth log noise
Ticket Details: We are looking through our EPP client logs on our Linux endpoints, and there is a large amount of noise surrounding Bluetooth. With Bluetooth blocked on our managed rights, the Linux machines are constantly generating logs that say ""Failed to stop bluetooth.service: Unit bluetooth service not loaded"". The Linux machines do not have Bluetooth installed.

Is there any way to fix this issue with the client trying to block something that is not even installed on the client? Maybe it can check to see if Bluetooth is installed before trying to block it?

Thank you

Thank you!

Hi Eduard,
Sounds good. How does next week sound on Monday or Tuesday? I am pretty
open both days, with exception to 10AM CST on Tuesday.

Cristian just informed me that it's not logs that we need to collect, it's about the screenshots and examples of logs that are noise.
Basically, what did not attach to the ticket were screenshots of notifications I assume generated by the endpoint client daemon.
That is what Joe tried to attach but did not reach our ticket.
Let me know how you want to proceed.

I see, so the Bluetooth process is missing altogether, so that might be the reason, the daemon is looking for it to either allow or deny it, and it just cannot do that.
I will open an investigation with the engineering team and will get back to you as soon as I have an update.
In the meantime, what distro are you using and what version, and also what agent version so I can check our list if we have a newer one?

Hi Eduard, so there is no bluetooth on the machine in general. That is the weird part.

As I suspected, the daemon is trying to kill the Bluetooth service and it is missing. This will need to be changed in a future version, and since I have to open a ticket with our devs for this, I will need to know your Distro, version and the EPP agent version you are using.
In the meantime, can you install a Bluetooth process or stack to stop the daemon's logs?

These issues seem to occur on all of our Linux distros.
The agent version on the machine in question is 2.4.2.1.
The Linux distros are Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 22.04.

Sounds like a plan. Do you want me to keep this ticket open or close it and you will open a new one if the issue is still present after the upgrade?

Hey Eduard,
Thanks for the update. 

These issues seem to occur on all of our Linux distros.

The agent version on the machine in question is 2.4.2.1.

The Linux distros are Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 22.04. 

 

The EPP server version is 5.9.2.0.

 

Yes, we can do a workaround in the meantime. 

 

Thanks,
Danny

Hi Daniel,

As I suspected, the daemon is trying to kill the Bluetooth service and it is missing. This will need to be changed in a future version, and since I have to open a ticket with our devs for this, I will need to know your Distro, version and the EPP agent version you are using.
In the meantime, can you install a Bluetooth process or stack to stop the daemon's logs?
Please let me know the requested info so I can create the dev request.

Hi Daniel,

I see, so the Bluetooth process is missing altogether, so that might be the reason, the daemon is looking for it to either allow or deny it, and it just cannot do that.
I will open an investigation with the engineering team and will get back to you as soon as I have an update.
In the meantime, what distro are you using and what version, and also what agent version so I can check our list if we have a newer one?
