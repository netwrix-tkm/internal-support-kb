Example 4: Xbox Wireless Headset
EM: see screenshot ""EM_device_LPTP2045733.jpg"" attached.
Clientname: LPTP2045733
Result:
Despite the release of the headset, no functionality could be established.
Hint:
- Device is displayed in the EPP client as long as the error message does not appear.
- Server logs are generally not available at the moment.
- SN was determined from the log files.

Please check, why whitelisting a ""Bluetooth other"" device type does not work.

Attaching logs also.
Just as a personal note, I see that this computer (LPTP2045733) is involved in more cases.","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-10-31T15:17:56.000Z","2024-10-31T15:17:56.000Z","false","false"

This is the same case as the one when the device is identified as ""Bluetooth Other"".
The issue described in this ticket  may be caused by the chnages on the rights for devices. 
Shoud be no longer replicating.

with „Bluetooth other“ device type setting “Allow Access” the external Bluetooth devices are working as expected.
--> see vendor ticket https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-Unify/_workitems/edit/363205.
 
Should the device type setting be deleted, and the Bluetooth device whitelisted again for requested testing?
Have any changes been made from your side?","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-11-04T13:27:24.000Z","2024-11-04T13:27:24.000Z","false","false"

 Hi @Alin Anca,

 If the right set on the device is working properly the right applied to it should not be deleted and added again.

We haven't made any changes on this part in the backend, since we were connected with the rights problem for aprox 8 computers and fix them, or asked the client to delete and re add them.

""As the local device type setting (workaround) is still not working, whitelisting the Bluetooth other device (headset) is still not functional on computer LPTP2045733 either!
From the customer's point of view, it should not matter whether the setting was renewed or not. This was only done to possibly restore functionality. Once the setting has been set, it must also work. Now the setting is not working, and the question remains why this is the case.
Some log files have already been uploaded to the ticket in this regard.
At the moment, the one user with computer LPTP2045733 simply cannot be helped. That is why I am asking for a solution.""","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-11-11T09:33:55.000Z","2024-11-11T09:33:55.000Z","false","false"

Alin, Can you please confirm if the issue is still present? after the hotfix which was applied this issue should no longer be present
