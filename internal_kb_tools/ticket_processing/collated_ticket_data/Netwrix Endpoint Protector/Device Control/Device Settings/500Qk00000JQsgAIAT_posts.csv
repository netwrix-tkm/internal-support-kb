Recently we tried to apply DLP settings at the Group level for our hosts in our environment. For some reason, the hosts didn't get the settings when they were part of the group, and settings changes were made.

Technically, if settings are applied from the Group level they should get inherited to the hosts and override the custom settings on the hosts.

Because right now if we want to make any DLP settings change we need to go to each host and make change which is not ideal.

Can you please provide a solution for this?

Thanks,
Parin","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-12T18:42:18.000Z"
