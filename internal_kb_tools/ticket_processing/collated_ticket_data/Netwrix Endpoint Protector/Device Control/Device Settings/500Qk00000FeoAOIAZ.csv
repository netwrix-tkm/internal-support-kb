"500Qk00000FeoAOIAZ","00420766","Support Ticket","Issues with Endpoint Protector and macOS 15.0 Beta","I am using Endpoint Protector version 5.9.4.0 with macOS 15.0 beta. I am encountering several issues that I need assistance with:

iPhone Charging: Despite setting the server to deny access for iPhones, they are still able to charge. If the ""deny access but allow charging"" option is selected, shouldn't it be unnecessary? Or could this be a simple bug?

Wi-Fi Blocking: Even with the ""block Wi-Fi if wired network connection is present"" option enabled, Wi-Fi is not being blocked. I have tried rebooting the Mac and reapplying the policy from the client, but the issue persists.

USB Modem : When setting the USB modem to ""deny access,"" it is still not being blocked. The Mac requires a USB modem to connect to a wired network. Why are both Wi-Fi and the USB modem still accessible despite the policies?

Could you please help me resolve these issues?

Thank you for your assistance.","","","","Same answer applies, ticket will be closed.","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Device Control","Device Settings","","","32.1","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Solution","Seong Yun Jeong","2024-09-12T04:38:54.000Z","2024-10-14T06:27:24.000Z"
