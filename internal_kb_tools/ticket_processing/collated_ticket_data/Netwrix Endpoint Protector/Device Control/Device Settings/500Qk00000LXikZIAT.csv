"500Qk00000LXikZIAT","00434829","Support Ticket","File Transfers to smartphones still taking place with Disable Bluetooth File Transfer ON","Hi Team,

I'm creating current ticket on behalf of Directi team.
They noticed that even though ""Disable Bluetooth File Transfer"" is turned ON for the test Windows computer, they can still transfer files via Bluetooth.

EPP Server version: 5.9.4.1.
EPP client version: 6.2.4.2000

Please let us know if additional details would be needed to proceed with the investigation of the described behavior.

Thank you,
