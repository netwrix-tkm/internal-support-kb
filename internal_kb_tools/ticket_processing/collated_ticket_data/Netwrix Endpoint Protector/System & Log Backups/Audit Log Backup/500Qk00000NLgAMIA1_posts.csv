auf unserem Endpoint-Protector sehe ich, dass das Auditlogbackup wohl festhängt.
Seit dem 10.03.2025 gibt es dort kein zusätzliches Backupfile mehr und es ist auch die Anzeige sichtbar, dass aktuell ein Auditlogbackup läuft. Das steht dort nun schon seit Stunden so und es kann nur ein Bug sein.

Die Version ist nicht 5.9.4.0, sondern 5.9.4.1 auf dem Server.

Ich brauche eine Möglichkeit, das hängende Backup abzubrechen, welches die eingeplanten Backups offenbar blockiert.

Vielen Dank und Grüße


Martin Neuhauser","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T13:18:57.000Z"
