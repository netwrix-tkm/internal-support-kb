Regarding exporting a large volume of data (millions of records) to external storage, do you have any recommended methods or tools for quickly reading or searching the exported data?

In Taiwan, many products rely on system backends to reload exported data, but the process is slow and not very practical.

Looking forward to your suggestions. Thank you!

Best regards,
Jay","","Customer MediaTek would like to know more details regarding how to export data in EPP.","We are gathering more details.

We have also provided them informations on how to use the Audit Log Backup.

They came back with a few questions regarding the log export and we explain that all the logs are exported in a CSV file.

We informed them that we do not have any parsing tools for the logs.","Assist the customer with all their questions","","Daniel Anton","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","Audit Log Backup","","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","Fongecloud Information Technology Ltd.
