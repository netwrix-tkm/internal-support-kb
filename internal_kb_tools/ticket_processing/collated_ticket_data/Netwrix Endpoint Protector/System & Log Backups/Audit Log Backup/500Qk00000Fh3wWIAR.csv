Por favor me ayudan a validar como puedo optimizar el espacio en disco y que no me aparezcan alertas como esta:

""Your appliance is running low on disk space, there is 67.09 gb free available from 257.22 gb (26%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support"".
