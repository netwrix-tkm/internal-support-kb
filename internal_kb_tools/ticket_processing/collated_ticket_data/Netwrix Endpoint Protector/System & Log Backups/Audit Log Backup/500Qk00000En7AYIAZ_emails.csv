Thank you for the update.
Since it is going past the spot where it is not allowed on the company network, could it be that the firewall or something is blocking it? Maybe it does not like that it goes to the Google login.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

I seem to be able to access the URL from my phone - But I would not be able to log in, as the accounts in our organization need to be onboarded with our tools, to which my mobile is not - and is ineligible to do

I can access the page where you would log in, which leads me to believe that this has gone past where the issue would normally occur","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #418849 - Server Log Deletion    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0En7AY:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","","andrei.pop@netwrix.com","false","2024-11-05T05:35:04.000Z","true"

Hi Andrei,

Thanks for this, I took this to our firewall team and I had run Wireshark on my device and found a lot of TCP Retransmissions. Our external Firewall team have asked if it would be possible to set up a joint call some time next week to look at this.

Is this an option and if so, would you be able to share your availability please?

Hi Andrei,

Thank you so much for joining the call earlier, your support was greatly appreciated! Apologies that Reliance Cyber (Our Firewall Provider) ran most of the meeting, though I believe we may be making good progress with these tickets (424220 and 418849)!

As discussed, if you wouldn’t mind checking with your Dev’s to see if our Public IP is being blocked and classed as a Denial of Service due to the number of packets being sent, that would be great.

We will await a response from the Devs that may be able to investigate further.

In terms of moving forwards, I can now seemingly access the Web Admin Dashboard again and start to process requests, but with the Endpoints not being able to connect to the server, this is leaving us still unable to process requests, as we have had new cameras delivered that have not been detected by endpoint protector once plugged in, (as the client has been unable to check-in and give these identifiers)

Would it be worth updating (at least) ticket 00424220 to Critical? By definition we believe it may fit that category, with the software being effectively inoperable in most cases, with updates to permissions not being picked up?

Many thanks again for your help, if there is anything further that is needed, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

I created an internal request for the devs to check the Public IP is being blocked and classed as a Denial of Service.
As a workaround you can try to allow devices using the Offline Temporary password option from the UI.

Thank you for following up.
This is still being looked into.
Can you please check in the Ep server ui if you receive new logs regarding the devices?
If you do not receive please collect a set of logs from a computer.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Update the policies a few times.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

This issue has occurred on my device today, meaning that our workaround is not working.

I am also no longer able to access the EP Server UI (at the time of this message) so I cannot check if any logs are being created.

This is becoming an increasingly alarming issue for us, as now we can no longer grant OTPs - Which was the previous workaround for the Clients not checking-in.

As there is no current workaround, do we need to upgrade the severity of this case?

Hi Andrei,

I am able to access the UI Again today, If I look at the logs for the machines with the issues, I cannot see them creating any.

For example, I know users are logged into machines as they are sending OTP Requests to me, but the logs last show updates 2 days ago on a device","Netwrix Support Ticket #418849 - Server Log Deletion","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","Conor Lane","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-25T16:35:02.000Z","true"

I have also noticed that in some instances, the computer loses its 'licenced status' and shows as Unlicenced and Offline. We have not reached our Licence Allocation Limit so I am not sure why this is happening.

For some computers that face this issue, this is not the case, so this may be a separate issue?","Netwrix Support Ticket #418849 - Server Log Deletion","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","Conor Lane","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-25T16:41:58.000Z","true"

Could it be the same issue with the public IP we noticed can't connect to the server?
As the Epp client does not connect to the server, you may have an automatic release set up to remove the license if the client is not seen for a certain time.
Do other computers from the same network have the same issue?

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

It seems as though it is only a select few machines from our other site. I asked our support team to remove and re-install the client and that fixed the issue on one machine, though remained on the others when this was attempted

I've just been through the UI and found the automatic release which was set to 15 days. I have upped this to 60 for now. Thanks I didn't know this was a setting!

Is there a way we can manually assign a licence, based on the above not working? I have asked my support team to remove and re-install the client again to see if this works.

Are there also any networking Pre-Requisites for the Client?

I presume it needs to be able to Access a URL or IP address over a port? If these details can be provided then I will check again with our firewall team to see that these changes are definitely put in place to allow communication

Kind Regards,
Conor","Netwrix Support Ticket #418849 - Server Log Deletion","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","Conor Lane","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-28T11:59:46.000Z","true"

The license can't be assigned manually. It is automatically assigned to computers with the Epp client installed that are communicating with the Epp server.
To communicate with the server the epp client uses port 443 to reach the server IP. If there is a load balancer or a proxy with SSL termination the communication can be interrupted.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

Thank you for your prompt response,

Just to confirm, should our firewall be configured to allow traffic to 'h6i313b.hosted.endpointprotector.com' port 443, or '3.9.47.175' port 443 (or both)

When we look at our Web UI, h6i313b.hosted.endpointprotector.com is listed in the Server IP field, though 3.9.47.175 I presume would be better?

You can check what the Epp client is trying to reach be opening the Epp client window clicking on setting s and pressing ctrl + alt +i .

Kind regards
