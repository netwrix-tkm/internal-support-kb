"500Qk00000En7AYIAZ","00418849","Support Ticket","Server Log Deletion","Hi,

We have recently encountered a message on the dashboard to say that ""Your appliance is on critical low disk space, there is only 1.62 gb free available from 19.52 gb (8%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support"". After backing up our logs and ensuring that the box is set to delete logs after backup, it appears that these logs have not been deleted, and we are nearing a full disk. At 4pm yesterday, we had 20% remaining, and now we have 8%, so it is filling quickly.

Could we please have support deleting the logs that are older than 6 months old, as we have backed these up already.

Many Thanks,
Conor,","","","","The Firewall Provider made the change as requested, and that appears to have solved the issues we have been facing on the Chalgrove Site.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","Audit Log Backup","NONE","","117.0","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","lcarney Cordina","2024-08-22T11:16:55.000Z","2024-12-17T10:59:49.000Z"
