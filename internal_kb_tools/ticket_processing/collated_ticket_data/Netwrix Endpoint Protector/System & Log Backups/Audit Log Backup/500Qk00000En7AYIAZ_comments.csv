Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

The images attached contain a message that is displayed when the customers don't have enough space.

More details you find in the following procedure:

--- CODE ---
13.6. Implement safety-belt settings when no values are present in the database
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bRDO5QVg8eXYAAXysRC7fAoGsqWDnw4/edit?gid=1670912709#gid=1670912709
--- CODE ---

In this case, is recommended the following:

1. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database
2. Delete older systems and audit log backups
3. Tune policies to reduce incoming log count

Thank you for the reply.
However, the Epp server space is filling up due to the /tmp file which is not covered audit log backup.
could there be a reason why the /tmp file is filling up at this rate?","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2024-08-26T08:32:32.000Z","2024-08-26T08:32:32.000Z","false","false"

Hi,

It is true the audit will help if the customer has many logs on the server.

I think that can cause the reported space problem.

Can you let us know which types of files the customer has in the /tmp directory?
