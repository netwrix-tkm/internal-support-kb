We have a call today 14:30 to check why the log backup is not working when scheduled. Even their external repository is not receiving them. Let me know if you can join or if you have another availability for the week.

Best regards,","","The Audit log backup does work on the customer's environment.","A remote session will be scheduled in order to investigate the issue on the EPP Server's backend.
