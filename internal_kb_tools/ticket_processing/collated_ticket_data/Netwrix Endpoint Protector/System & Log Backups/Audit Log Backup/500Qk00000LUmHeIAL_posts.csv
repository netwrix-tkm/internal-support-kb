We have a call today 14:30 to check why the log backup is not working when scheduled. Even their external repository is not receiving them. Let me know if you can join or if you have another availability for the week.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-05T13:19:03.000Z"

Probably the database is very large in size and there is not enough disk space available to create the audit log backup.","","","","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-02-05T14:13:32.000Z"
