As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

If the appliance is hosted on AWS, please add an Outbound rule for SSH access, on the Security tab, for the IP of your computer and port 62828.

Hi Iosif,

Thanks for checking in, and I also appreciate you taking the time to meet with me earlier this week.

We're still experiencing the issue, and I’m currently waiting on our internal server-side support team to assist with the steps you outlined for granting you and your team access. In the meantime, we’d like to keep this ticket open until we’re able to complete those actions and proceed with next steps.

I’ll follow up once we’ve made progress on our end.

Best regards,
Philip

Hello Philip,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440286. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440286
Ticket Subject: Critical Low Disk Space Alert – Assistance Needed with Log and Shadow File Backup
Ticket Details: Hi Support,

We’ve received the following critical alert from our Endpoint Protector appliance:

“Your appliance is on critical low disk space, there is only 5.8 GB free available from 446.21 GB (1%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support. You will be automatically logged out in 3 minutes.”

We’ve attempted to take action as suggested, but we’re running into several issues:

The application hangs or becomes unresponsive when attempting to back up or delete older shadow files.

When performing a log backup with the option to include shadow files, the resulting .gz backup files are smaller than expected, which raises concerns that data might be missing or not included properly.

Can you assist us in:

- Diagnosing why the backup process hangs or fails when managing shadow files?

- Verifying whether the shadow files are being properly included in our backups?

- Guiding us on safely clearing space without risking data loss?

We’d appreciate your help resolving this as soon as possible given the critical state of the system.

Best,
Philip

Thank you!

Hello Philip,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440286. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440286
Ticket Subject: Critical Low Disk Space Alert – Assistance Needed with Log and Shadow File Backup
Ticket Details: Hi Support,

We’ve received the following critical alert from our Endpoint Protector appliance:

“Your appliance is on critical low disk space, there is only 5.8 GB free available from 446.21 GB (1%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support. You will be automatically logged out in 3 minutes.”

We’ve attempted to take action as suggested, but we’re running into several issues:

The application hangs or becomes unresponsive when attempting to back up or delete older shadow files.

When performing a log backup with the option to include shadow files, the resulting .gz backup files are smaller than expected, which raises concerns that data might be missing or not included properly.

Can you assist us in:

- Diagnosing why the backup process hangs or fails when managing shadow files?

- Verifying whether the shadow files are being properly included in our backups?

- Guiding us on safely clearing space without risking data loss?

We’d appreciate your help resolving this as soon as possible given the critical state of the system.

Hi Iosif,

 

Thanks for your patience. We’ve completed a backup of the disk and server, and I now have what I need to allow for temporary SSH access as discussed.

 

I'm also including, Carl, from our MSP, who may be joining the next call to assist from our side.

 

Would you happen to have availability to connect this Friday? If not, early next week works as well – just let us know what time works best on your end.

 

Best regards,

Phil

Hi Iosif,

 

Thanks for checking in, and I also appreciate you taking the time to meet with me earlier this week.

 

We're still experiencing the issue, and I’m currently waiting on our internal server-side support team to assist with the steps you outlined for granting you and your team access. In the meantime, we’d like to keep this ticket open until we’re able to complete those actions and proceed with next steps.

 

I’ll follow up once we’ve made progress on our end.

 

Best regards,

Philip

Hello Philip,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440286. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440286
Ticket Subject: Critical Low Disk Space Alert – Assistance Needed with Log and Shadow File Backup
Ticket Details: Hi Support,

We’ve received the following critical alert from our Endpoint Protector appliance:

“Your appliance is on critical low disk space, there is only 5.8 GB free available from 446.21 GB (1%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support. You will be automatically logged out in 3 minutes.”

We’ve attempted to take action as suggested, but we’re running into several issues:

The application hangs or becomes unresponsive when attempting to back up or delete older shadow files.

When performing a log backup with the option to include shadow files, the resulting .gz backup files are smaller than expected, which raises concerns that data might be missing or not included properly.

Can you assist us in:

- Diagnosing why the backup process hangs or fails when managing shadow files?

- Verifying whether the shadow files are being properly included in our backups?

- Guiding us on safely clearing space without risking data loss?

We’d appreciate your help resolving this as soon as possible given the critical state of the system.

Best,
Philip

Thank you!

We're all set from our end - we're able to access the EPP UI now. We ended up increasing the CPU and RAM allocated to the server, which resolved the issue with the UI hanging up after you help clear up the file shadows in the backend.
