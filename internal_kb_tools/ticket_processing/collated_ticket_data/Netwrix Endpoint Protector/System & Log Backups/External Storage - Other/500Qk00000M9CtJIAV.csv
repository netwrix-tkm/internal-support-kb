"500Qk00000M9CtJIAV","00436559","Support Ticket","Disable SSH access and remove File Shadowing","Hello,

Our company is currently using (Cososys Endpoint Protector), and we need assistance with the following:

     SSH Access: Please provide the username and password for SSH access.
     
     Log File Cleanup: All File Shadow data needs to be deleted. The necessary 
     information has been backed up, so there is no issue with deletion.

We are experiencing a critical disk space issue, leading to the following error:
""Your appliance is on critical low disk space, there is only 1.71 GB free available from 40.73 GB (4%). EPP Server functionality and performance may be severely affected. Use Audit Log Backup to reduce the logs stored in the database, delete older system and audit log backups, and tune policies to reduce incoming log count. For further assistance contact Support.
You will be automatically logged out in 3 minutes.""

Please provide support to resolve this issue.

Thank you.","","- connected to the server backend and deleted all the file shadows, as confirmed","Connect to the server backend and deleted all the file shadows","Connected to the server backend and deleted all the file shadows, as confirmed","Incorrect configuration: audit settings","Alin Anca","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","External Storage - Other","","","14.0","Closed - Resolved","MIK LLC","Naranerdene Chuluunbaatar","2025-02-21T08:13:25.000Z","2025-03-07T09:18:22.000Z"
