We have successfully configure the storage in EPP(Picture1).
We are experiencing 2 different issues now:
1. Not all files get shadowed to the external storage. I have a feeling that this is only for the files with Content Aware Protection. The files shadowed via USB File Tracing seem to appear on the external storage.
For example: In the first scenario I disabled the option ""Keep Copy on EPP server"" and uploaded a file to wetransfer. In the Report you can see the ""shadow-button"" but when I click it, it says ""File not found"". And if I have a look at the external storage repository the file is indeed missing. (Picture2)
However it is working sometimes as you can see in the external repository with Picture2 with the first file ""<a href='https://rot.pptx' target='_blank'>rot.pptx</a>"". This file I also uploaded in the browser and here it got shadowed to the external storage.
Another examply you can see in Picture3, where the ""download-shadow-button"" is here but the file is not listed on the external storage - not even the computer is listed on the external storage.
Then I have enabled the option ""Keep copy on EPP Server"" for testing purposes again and the file was shadowed to the EPP server, I can download it, but also the file does not get transfered to the external storage.

2. Issue: We tried to also use this external storage to save the system backups. However, when i make a System Backup via ""System Backup v2"", the backup simply does not appear on the external storage. I haven't tried it with ""System Backup (v1)"" as they don't work in our case, but is it possible that for now only Backups from ""System Backup (v1)"" are copied to the external storage and not these ones from ""System Backup v2)"".
I hope we can solve this 2 issues we have right now with the external storage.

Thank you in advance!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-21T14:20:19.000Z"
