We need assistance with System and logs backup to external storage configured through EPP web interface. We have made sure that we have entered the correct Samba/Network share details with user credentials and post testing the external storage is accessible.

We need assistance with the configuration to create weekly backup.
If the weekly backup is created regularly, will it help us restore the server from latest backup in case if the EPP server breaks down?

Request you to please add below email address in all the communications.
