I just received a reply from our Engineering team. They advised using Azure SMB instead of Azure Blobs, as Azure Blobs are not officially supported yet.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues.

Thank you!

Hi Iosif,

Thank you for the update regarding Azure Blob support. After some testing, we were able to successfully connect the external storage via Azure SMB.

We would like to schedule a follow-up call to test sending files to this external share through the Netwrix EPP UI. Additionally, we have a few questions about provisioning licenses to new users and computers.

We're available tomorrow between 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM PT. Feel free to send an invite if any block within this time frame works for you.

Kind regards,
Philip
