Weâ€™re running into issues setting up external storage using a container in an Azure Storage Account via SFTP. Despite entering the requested credentials, we continue to receive an ""incorrect credentials"" error.

Could you help us troubleshoot?

Thank you,

In today's remote session we managed to access the sftp storage via backend with the sftp command, and checked the tls values in nginx config file. The relevant screenshots from the EPP UI, backend commands and Azure have been attached to this ticket.","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2025-04-25T17:08:26.000Z"

We had a remote session in which we tested the Azure external storage and provided answers regarding licensing. The customer noticed communication issues for a few computers that don't communicate with the EPP server. They will try a reinstall first, and if this won't work, we'll schedule another remote session to address that.","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2025-04-29T20:37:12.000Z"
