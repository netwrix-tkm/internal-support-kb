1. ""File not found"" is usually appears when the shadow is not yet uploaded to the server. In this case, you can check the computer under C:WindowsSystem32configsystemprofileAppDataLocalCoSoSysEPPshadows.
We can schedule a remote connection to generate a shadow and check the transfer from the backend.

2. I am not sure Backup V2 is included in the external storage.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,


  1.  Got it. I will keep an eye on it, do some testing and then come back to you again.
  2.  Is it possible to find out? If it's not included - is this planned for the future, as Backup v1 will be discontinued?

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,
