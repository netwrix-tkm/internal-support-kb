Customer name is PrivatBank.
They wanted to clarify if it is possible for EPP server to get access to S3 Bucket with no entering Access Key ID and Secret Access Key?
Can EPP AMI get access to the S3 Bucket by internal AWS IAM role and policy?

This instruction:
<a href='https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemMaintenance/ShadowRepository.htm' target='_blank'>https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemMaintenance/ShadowRepository.htm</a>#s3_bucket_file_shadow_repository
It is related to the external S3 Bucket, but customer has all Buckets only internal due to the security reasons.

Could you please clarify these questions?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-16T07:45:35.000Z"

06-05 we have checked why the eu-central -1 is missing and it seems that for now these are the regions that we added to the Indirect artefact. Our recommendation would be to use one of the following existing regions:
us-west1 - Northern California
us-west2 - Oregon
eu-west1 - EU (Ireland)
ap-southeast-1 - Asia Paciﬁc (Singapore)
ap-southeast-2 - Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney)

sa-east-1 - South America (São Paulo)
