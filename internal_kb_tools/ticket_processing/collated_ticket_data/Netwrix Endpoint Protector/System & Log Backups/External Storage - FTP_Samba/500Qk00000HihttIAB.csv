"500Qk00000HihttIAB","00425671","Support Ticket","Need help to configure ""external Storage settings""","Dear Netwrix Team,
we want to save ""Audit Log Backups"" and ""System Backups"" on an external ""network share"" by using SMB Protocol. 

We tried the recommended settings in the operating instructions but the test says ""Could not connect to network share / Please check the credentials and server settings"". 
The used Credentials are correct but we need you to check and test the settings we made in the management console.

Can we make an appointment for a Teamviewer session next week?

Thank you in advance.
