Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?


Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Yes, you can try to import it manually in ""System Maintenance > System Backup."" Once you have done so, you can try to recover it.

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.



Thanks and Regards

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Kind regards

The Epp server does not have the functionality to use a credential file to login into the External Storage.
Is it possible to allow the server to connect using an account and password?

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.


Thanks and Regards

Can you please confirm with the NAS management team what Authentication and Protocol version they are using so we can include it in the option.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GKjkY:ref

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""

Hi Andrei,

Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

Hello,

Yes, you can try to import it manually in ""System Maintenance > System Backup."" Once you have done so, you can try to recover it.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

To confirm it for me ,so the latest backup should be imported in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" from the external backup location manually?

 

I want to test this on this Friday so want to be sure.

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

If the old server is completely lost you can setup a new server and import the latest backlup.
To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,

Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?

The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we’ll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

 

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

 

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

Thanks for your help in configuring this in the session yesterday. 

Can you please help me with the process of restoration from the backup?

 

We are taking shadows , audit logs and system backups. During a DR, how will I restore it to the application?

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

The Epp server does not have the functionality to use a credential file to login into the External Storage.
Is it possible to allow the server to connect using an account and password?

Hello Andrei,

I got to know if it is a combination share then the permission denied issue is resolved with a creadential file instead of using the NPA account and the password. Is it possible to test it once ?

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Hello Andrei,

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Hello Andrei,

I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same. 

Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.

avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

 

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more. 

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

    - change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
    - set protocol version to 'Default'
    -  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
    - try not to use any special characters for the password
    - after saving the external storage settings wait 2, 3 minutes before testing the connection for external storage type Samba/ Network share

Thank you for the confirmation.
I will update you as soon as I get the feedback.
In the meantime did you get the chance to ask your colleagues about the firewall and the password for the SMB?

Hello Andrei,

 

Hope you had a good weekend. I am adding my colleagues onto this thread because I will be OOF for all of October. This ticket is a large priority for us so we can start our deployment. Let me know once you have something to share from the developers or if we need to collect logs.

Hello Andrei,

 

Here is a screenshot of my settings:

 

 

 

I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. “Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.”

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Hello Andrei,
That is expected but I noticed that all the events in 'reports and analysis'  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
Thanks for your help in configuring this in the session yesterday.
Can you please help me with the process of restoration from the backup?

We are taking shadows , audit logs and system backups. During a DR, how will I restore it to the application?



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hello,

The Epp server does not have the functionality to use a credential file to login into the External Storage.
Is it possible to allow the server to connect using an account and password?

I got to know if it is a combination share then the permission denied issue is resolved with a creadential file instead of using the NPA account and the password. Is it possible to test it once ?

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.

Hello Andrei,



Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Hello Andrei,

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in ‘reports and analysis’  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,

Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,

Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?

The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we’ll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

 

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

 

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

We are taking shadows , audit logs and system backups. During a DR, how will I restore it to the application?

I have created one SMB only share. Lets check next week if that can be mounted. 

Can we have some time scheduled on Monday afternoon?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

The Epp server does not have the functionality to use a credential file to login into the External Storage.
Is it possible to allow the server to connect using an account and password?

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I got to know if it is a combination share then the permission denied issue is resolved with a creadential file instead of using the NPA account and the password. Is it possible to test it once ?

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Can you please confirm with the NAS management team what Authentication and Protocol version they are using so we can include it in the option.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same. 

Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.

avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

 

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more. 

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

To confirm if it is working you can check the SMB location to see if 3 folders and a text file is created.

Please try the below.
    - change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
    - set protocol version to 'Default'
    -  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
    - try not to use any special characters for the password
    - after saving the external storage settings wait 2, 3 minutes before testing the connection for external storage type Samba/ Network share

Hello Andrei,

As discussed in our last call, I tried the test by updating the password. Now I do not get the error but see this even after saving the password 1 hour back. 

Could you please let me know how much time should I wait before running the test?

Hello,

Not really on the UI.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection to run the command in the backend to see if there will be an error shown.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

 

Here is a screenshot of my settings:

 

 

 

I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. “Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.”

 

Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Hello Andrei,
That did not happen. It deleted everything from the 'reports and analysis'. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the 'reports and analysis' was set to blank every time of the restore.


Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in 'reports and analysis'  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?


Thanks and Regards

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GKjkY:ref

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

If you want we can schedule a remote connection to run the command in the backend to see if there will be an error shown.

Hello Andrei,



Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Hello Andrei,

That did not happen. It deleted everything from the ‘reports and analysis’. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the ‘reports and analysis’ was set to blank every time of the restore. 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello Andrei,

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in ‘reports and analysis’  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,

Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Hello Andrei,

Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?

The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we’ll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

 

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

 

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

This also does not work as well. Can you please check from avm120000228 server if it is possible to connect to the SMB share?

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Can you please confirm with the NAS management team what Authentication and Protocol version they are using so we can include it in the option.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same. 

Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.

avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

 

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more. 

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

To confirm if it is working you can check the SMB location to see if 3 folders and a text file is created.

Please try the below.
    - change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
    - set protocol version to 'Default'
    -  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
    - try not to use any special characters for the password
    - after saving the external storage settings wait 2, 3 minutes before testing the connection for external storage type Samba/ Network share

Hello Andrei,

As discussed in our last call, I tried the test by updating the password. Now I do not get the error but see this even after saving the password 1 hour back. 

Could you please let me know how much time should I wait before running the test?

Hello Andrei,

 

Here is a screenshot of my settings:

 

 

 

I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. “Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.”

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:

Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Hello,

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
That did not happen. It deleted everything from the 'reports and analysis'. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the 'reports and analysis' was set to blank every time of the restore.


Thanks and Regards

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in 'reports and analysis'  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.



Thanks and Regards

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

We are taking shadows , audit logs and system backups. During a DR, how will I restore it to the application?

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hello,

Not really on the UI.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection to run the command in the backend to see if there will be an error shown.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,



Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

System Backup is scheduled to be obsolete in the future.
To see the older logs you will need to rely on the Audit.

Hi Andrei,

We took system back v2 as System back up always get stuck at 99% and never gets completed for us.

Hello,

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

That did not happen. It deleted everything from the ‘reports and analysis’. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the ‘reports and analysis’ was set to blank every time of the restore. 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello Andrei,

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in ‘reports and analysis’  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,

Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,

Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?

The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we’ll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

 

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

 

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

This is priority for us, so we can adjust our agenda to make it happen – but we really can’t this morning.

 

We can do it anytime from 1pm on (Amsterdam timezone).

Hello Andrei,

This also does not work as well. Can you please check from avm120000228 server if it is possible to connect to the SMB share?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Can you please confirm with the NAS management team what Authentication and Protocol version they are using so we can include it in the option.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same. 

Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.

avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

 

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more. 

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

To confirm if it is working you can check the SMB location to see if 3 folders and a text file is created.

Does it mean it’s working?

Please try the below.
    - change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
    - set protocol version to 'Default'
    -  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
    - try not to use any special characters for the password
    - after saving the external storage settings wait 2, 3 minutes before testing the connection for external storage type Samba/ Network share

Hello Andrei,

As discussed in our last call, I tried the test by updating the password. Now I do not get the error but see this even after saving the password 1 hour back. 

Could you please let me know how much time should I wait before running the test?

Hello Andrei,

 

Hope you had a good weekend. I am adding my colleagues onto this thread because I will be OOF for all of October. This ticket is a large priority for us so we can start our deployment. Let me know once you have something to share from the developers or if we need to collect logs.

Hello Andrei,

 

Here is a screenshot of my settings:

 

 

 

I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. “Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.”

You can also try to:

Hello Andrei,
This brings my concern. In system backup v2 , we do not take the audit logs but when we restore the system backup v2 , every report and logs in the server gets deleted. If we do not take audit logs then restore should not delete the previous reports in the console .



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hello,

System Backup is scheduled to be obsolete in the future.
To see the older logs you will need to rely on the Audit.

Hello,

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Hello Andrei,
That did not happen. It deleted everything from the 'reports and analysis'. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the 'reports and analysis' was set to blank every time of the restore.


Thanks and Regards

Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.



Thanks and Regards

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GKjkY:ref

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hello,

Not really on the UI.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection to run the command in the backend to see if there will be an error shown.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,



Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Hello Andrei,

This brings my concern. In system backup v2 , we do not take the audit logs but when we restore the system backup v2 , every report and logs in the server gets deleted. If we do not take audit logs then restore should not delete the previous reports in the console .

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

System Backup is scheduled to be obsolete in the future.
To see the older logs you will need to rely on the Audit.

Hi Andrei,

Hello,

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Hello Andrei,

That did not happen. It deleted everything from the ‘reports and analysis’. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the ‘reports and analysis’ was set to blank every time of the restore. 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello Andrei,

That is expected but I noticed that all the events in ‘reports and analysis’  previous to the backup creation time also got deleted from the console.  Is it expected in the system backup restore?

Hi Andrei,

Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

 

 

Thanks and Regards

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,

Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?

The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we’ll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

 

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

 

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

Can you please confirm with the NAS management team what Authentication and Protocol version they are using so we can include it in the option.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,

I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same. 

Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.

avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

 

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more. 

 

 

 

Thanks and Regards

Sudipa

To confirm if it is working you can check the SMB location to see if 3 folders and a text file is created.

Please try the below.
    - change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
    - set protocol version to 'Default'
    -  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
    - try not to use any special characters for the password
    - after saving the external storage settings wait 2, 3 minutes before testing the connection for external storage type Samba/ Network share

Hello Andrei,

As discussed in our last call, I tried the test by updating the password. Now I do not get the error but see this even after saving the password 1 hour back. 

Could you please let me know how much time should I wait before running the test?

Hello Andrei,

 

Here is a screenshot of my settings:

 

 

 

I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. “Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.”

Hello Andrei,
This brings my concern. In system backup v2 , we do not take the audit logs but when we restore the system backup v2 , every report and logs in the server gets deleted. If we do not take audit logs then restore should not delete the previous reports in the console .

Hello,

System Backup is scheduled to be obsolete in the future.
To see the older logs you will need to rely on the Audit.

Hello,

Did you use System Backup or System Backup V2.
System Backup V2 does not take the logs. That is why we setup the Audit log backup as well.

Hello Andrei,
That did not happen. It deleted everything from the 'reports and analysis'. I restored the back up from 1st Nov to DR server and then on 4th Nov I took backup from the DR server and restored it to the primary server. In both the servers the 'reports and analysis' was set to blank every time of the restore.


Thanks and Regards

Hi Andrei,
Today I tried testing DR process for the setup. When I downloaded the System backup from the DR server and uploaded the to the primary server , I noticed that the old audit logs also got removed  from the primary server. I did not expected the older audit logs to be deleted as we do not even migrate the audit log. Is this expected?

To save the report we have setup the Audit Log backup.

Hello Andrei,
Considering the old server and new server has exactly same , please explain the process. Or share any documentation if there?
The old server version is with v5.9.4.0 and we'll have the new server (DR ) server also 5.9.4.0.

Should I upload all the backups (system and audit) both in ""System Maintenance > System Backup"" ?

I tried with the system backup already but it does not shows the content awareness report or other logs.



Thanks and Regards

Hello,

Depending if the server can be recovered or not, you would need to confirm the Epp server version the backup was saved as.
Then you can upload the backup from ""System Maintenance > System Backup"".

Hello,

In this case, you can try setting the Authentication Security to Default.
And the Protocol version to SMB 3.
If you do not have a Protocol version you can try to set it as default.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,
I have checked it and we do not have Protocol version should be SMB 3.0 as we have mostly win 10 and win 11 . Also for the SMB Active Directory Authentication is used. No NTLM is configured in our Isilon as per the NAS support team.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000GKjkY:ref

Hello Andrei,
I have checked without AD as well . Still the error stays the same.
Also I had a chat with NAS management team. He has confirmed the user account exists in AD and is configured on the SMB protocol. Also permission is set for this NP account on directory level.
avm120000228 is added as server to the ACL of this SMB share. So everything is verified from their end.

Can you check connecting to the share from avm120000228 once more ? There is nothing I can try out on this more.



Thanks and Regards
Sudipa

Hello,

Not really on the UI.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection to run the command in the backend to see if there will be an error shown.

Kind regards

Hello Andrei,



Here is a screenshot of my settings:







I have tried changing the authentication security and protocol version to all the different combinations. However, I did not know to wait 3 minutes. Is there by chance anywhere I can see more detailed logs? The error is quite ambiguous. ""Could not connect to network share. Please check the credentials and server settings.""



Met vriendelijke groet / Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please send me a screenshot of your settings?

After saving the setting please wait at least 3 minutes before testing the connection.
You can also try to:
- change authentication security to 'NTLMv2'
- set protocol version to 'Default'
-  leave the 'Domain or Workgroup' empty
Also, can you let me know if you have in your password any special characters other than: ""@#$^*()_+{}|:-=[];%?&/'.!""<>`, ).""?

Kind regards
