Hi,

Please make sure that the sftp user has permissions in the Remote Directory to create files/directories.

Connect in the backend, navigate to theÂ Remote Directory that was setup in the UI and try to create a file/directory.

I confirmed the user he is using for SFTP can create a folder. We connected to the sftp from the epp server backend and created a folder in the external location.
Also, his passwor does not contain special characters.","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2024-10-28T13:09:19.000Z","2024-10-28T13:09:19.000Z","false","false"

Hello,

In the External Storage Settings form, save the configurations that works in the backend sftp test and make a test with a file shadow to see if it is exported in the storage. During the test collect the client log.

If this test also does not work, then most likely permissions are not granted on the storage server, user or remote directory.
