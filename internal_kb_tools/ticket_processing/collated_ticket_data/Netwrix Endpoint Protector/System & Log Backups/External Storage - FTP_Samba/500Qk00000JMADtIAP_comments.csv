Hello,

In the External Storage Settings form, save the configurations that works in the backend sftp test and make a test with a file shadow to see if it is exported in the storage. During the test collect the client log.
If this test also does not work, then most likely permissions are not granted on the storage server, user or remote directory.

Thank you for your reply @Mihai.
Sorry, but I don't fully understand the following statement:

""In the External Storage Settings form, save the configurations that works in the backend sftp test and make a test with a file shadow to see if it is exported in the storage.""

Can you please detail step-by step what needs to be performed?

As I mentioned in the description:

We have checked if SFTP works via any client to remote public server and it can communicate. 
The user is correct and has the necessary permissions
We have performed a test to create a new file in the selected path of the SFTP and it could be created successfully.
None of the generated file shadows are transferred to the SFTP server.

Please also see the attached screenshots.

Thank you","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-12-18T16:10:12.000Z","2024-12-18T16:10:12.000Z","false","false"

Hello,

Does the hosted server from Oracle Cloud have some requirements? Such as TLS version or a list of used cyphers.
Are the credentials (user, host, port) set correctly?Â 
Does the user have the necessary permissions to write on the required location?

Is it possible that the user may have some restrictions. This can be checked by creating a new test user with a simple password and with the required permissions. Then add and save the credentials for the new user into the System Maintenance -> External Storage form. After the form is saved, please test the connection again and also check if the shadows are transferred to the SFTP server.

""The DLP is now successfully sending files to the external storage.

It appears that the EPP server was still requesting outdated ciphers that, by default, are disabled in OpenSSL. After enabling these outdated ciphers, the SFTP functionality is now working as expected.""

Thank you for the great recommendation, Mihai!","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2024-12-20T15:08:20.000Z","2024-12-20T15:08:20.000Z","false","false"
