"500Qk00000KbWS1IAN","00432050","Support Ticket","Reduce size of backups for migration purposes","Hi, I was recently tidying up a server before preparing to migrate it to a new instance with the updated OVF file. I have backed up and deleted all Audit Logs older than one month, cleared old computers not seen in the last month and removed thousands of old users. However it does not seem to have made any difference to the backup size which is around 400MB.

When dealing with our last issue, Alin mentioned that our backups are too big to do the migration alone, so can we have some advice how to meaningfully reduce these, and also request assistance with the migration. We have successfully the deployed the new version and it is waiting to accept the backup.

Many Thanks,
Pete","","The backup of the old server is larger than 400 mb, which is the upload limit on the new server.","Waiting for the customer to import the SSL Certificate.","The servers were migrated to the new VMs","","Emil Podar","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","System Backup","","","17.0","Closed - Resolved","NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit","Pete Taylor","2025-01-14T17:05:06.000Z","2025-01-31T15:55:48.000Z"
