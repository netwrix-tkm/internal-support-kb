"500Qk00000MHHsbIAH","00436889","Support Ticket","Entities Cannot Be Exported Due to Potential Low Disk Space (from Huawei)","Dear Sir/Madam,

I submit this ticket on behalf of Huawei.

Currently, entities such as users and computers cannot be exported. There is no response after the Export button is clicked. The prompt shows the potential reason of this problem is low space disks. Please refer to the attached screenshots.

Until Feb 15, the system runs well.

Please help Huawei solve this problem. Thanks a lot in advance. (I prefer Adrian handle this ticket. He is always in charge of Huawei's case).","","","","Partner confirmed that this ticket can be closed after helping the customer with their queries in a session.","","Adrian Draghici","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","System Backup","","5941","34.9","Closed - Resolved","Qast Systems Solutions Inc.","Jessica Zhang","2025-02-25T10:42:34.000Z","2025-04-01T08:42:13.000Z"
