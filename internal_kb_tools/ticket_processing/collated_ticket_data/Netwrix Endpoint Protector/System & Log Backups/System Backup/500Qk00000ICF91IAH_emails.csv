The steps to take a system backup using the System Backup v2 feature is on page 392 of the 5.9.4 guide I have attached to this response. That however will not save logs and audits. If you wish to also back those up, you can set up automatic backups of those to be downloaded using the Audit Log Backup feature starting on page 380 of the same doc.

Something to note, if you do need to restore from a backup from System Backup v2, the server version you are restoring to needs to match the server version of when the backup was taken. Also, for the Audit Log Backup, if you want to keep the logs in place after the backup has been taken, you will need to click the checkbox to keep backed up logs and/or backed up shadows if you are using that feature as well.

​​​​​​​I will also be reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you if you have follow up questions.

Thank you,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
Please let us know if this ticket can be closed.

Please let us know if this ticket can be closed.

Hi Team,

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few
specific clarifications .
It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below
questions:-

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?
2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users
/ agents details?
3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still
necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Dear Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
 
We hope that above insights will help your team decide on the optimal backup option for your team's needs.

Hi Andrain,

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now
we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created
properly or not.
Is there any process to check?

In order to do that you will need another image of Endpoint Protector imported and powered on, which should have same version of EPP as the old one has.
Then you will need to upload the System Backup V2 and import it. This would represent the entire restoring process.

Hi Andrain,

 

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created properly or not. 

Is there any process to check?

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Dear Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
 
We hope that above insights will help your team decide on the optimal backup option for your team's needs.

Hi Andrain,

Hi Ram,

In order to do that you will need another image of Endpoint Protector imported and powered on, which should have same version of EPP as the old one has.
Then you will need to upload the System Backup V2 and import it. This would represent the entire restoring process.

Hi Andrain,

 

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created properly or not. 

Is there any process to check?

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Dear Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
 
We hope that above insights will help your team decide on the optimal backup option for your team's needs.

The System Backup V2 does not contain the logs and the shadows.
It contains the configuration, settings, entities, rights etc but not the logs and the shadows. 
The Logs and Shadows are being backup by the Audit Log Backup functionality, which cannot be imported on another server and even if it would be possible - it will only import as an archive.

Hi Andrain,

 

Yes, I want to install an Endpoint Protector server in another virtual environment . So I can test my logs whether all the logs are restored in a virtual environment or not.

Hi Ram,

In order to do that you will need another image of Endpoint Protector imported and powered on, which should have same version of EPP as the old one has.
Then you will need to upload the System Backup V2 and import it. This would represent the entire restoring process.

Hi Andrain,

 

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created properly or not. 

Is there any process to check?

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Dear Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
 
We hope that above insights will help your team decide on the optimal backup option for your team's needs.

Hi Andrain,

 

Yes, you explained this before, by mistake I mentioned restoring logs in a previous email, but I want to restore and test server all the configurations & added users details after restoring System Backup V2. 

 

 




Thanks,

Dear Ram,

The System Backup V2 does not contain the logs and the shadows.
It contains the configuration, settings, entities, rights etc but not the logs and the shadows. 
The Logs and Shadows are being backup by the Audit Log Backup functionality, which cannot be imported on another server and even if it would be possible - it will only import as an archive.

Hi Ram,

In order to do that you will need another image of Endpoint Protector imported and powered on, which should have same version of EPP as the old one has.
Then you will need to upload the System Backup V2 and import it. This would represent the entire restoring process.

Hi Andrain,

 

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created properly or not. 

Is there any process to check?

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Please find the 5940 version of the Endpoint Protector image below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/virtual_appliance/V5940/Endpoint-Protector-5.9.4.0-Virtual-Appliance-64b-OVF.zip

Please note that the backup can be imported only if it has the same server version, otherwise you will need to bring up both appliances to same version before doing the System backup and the import.

Hi Andrain,

 

Yes, you explained this before, by mistake I mentioned restoring logs in a previous email, but I want to restore and test server all the configurations & added users details after restoring System Backup V2. 

 

 




Thanks,

Dear Ram,

The System Backup V2 does not contain the logs and the shadows.
It contains the configuration, settings, entities, rights etc but not the logs and the shadows. 
The Logs and Shadows are being backup by the Audit Log Backup functionality, which cannot be imported on another server and even if it would be possible - it will only import as an archive.

Hi Andrain,

 

Yes, I want to install an Endpoint Protector server in another virtual environment . So I can test my logs whether all the logs are restored in a virtual environment or not.

Hi Ram,

In order to do that you will need another image of Endpoint Protector imported and powered on, which should have same version of EPP as the old one has.
Then you will need to upload the System Backup V2 and import it. This would represent the entire restoring process.

I have one more last question, as we have already taken System Backup v2, now we want to restore it on another machine to check if the backup is created properly or not. 

Is there any process to check?

Hi Ram,

Sure, no problem, I thought the previous email which contains actually answers for this did not reached to you. But I will answer each of your questions below:

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

The System Backup represents the first System backup where you could choose to backup only the configuration or the configuration + the logs database, but the technology behind this feature is not deprecated and as per this the Endpoint Protector team released the System Backup V2, which uses new technology, making the backups smaller and faster. As a difference the System Backup V2 does not contains logs inside due to the fact that the logs are being Back up by the Audit Backup feature.

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

Yes the System Backup V2 contains everything in terms of configuration, settings, rights, policies, entities, except the logs and shadows.


3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

As mentioned above - soon the System Backup V1 will be removed and we will have only the System backup V2 in EPP so you can continue using only the V2 feature having all benefits included.

Hi Team,

 

This is the same last email and after seeing this one I asked for a few specific clarifications .

It would be great if you provide me your valuable suggestion for below questions:-

 


1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well?

Dear Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
 
We hope that above insights will help your team decide on the optimal backup option for your team's needs.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000ICF91:ref
 

Hi team,

 

Can you please explain me below things:- 

 

1) What are the differences between System Backup & System Backup v2 ?

2) Will System Backup v2 store all server configurations, as well as users / agents details?

3) If creating a backup using System Backup v2 is working fine, is it still necessary or important  to take the System Backup as well? 

 




Thanks,

Ram Singh

Hi Ram,

We would like to inform you that System Backup will be discontinued starting with the next Endpoint Protector release 5.9.5.0. (direct link to Netwrix Endpoint
Protector v5.9.4 Bug Fix List: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes.pdf ) :



Audit Log Backup feature (that creates backup files for EPP logs/events) can be scheduled to take place regularly and the backup files can be automatically directed to an external storage defined by your team under System Maintenance > External Storage.

Creating regular snapshots (or checkpoints as Microsoft currently calls this feature) is a best practice heavily used across the industry when working with virtual machines and virtualization environments, but also across Endpoint Protector customers. We encourage all our customers to take advantage of this well-established practice and back up the whole Endpoint Protector virtual machine (state, logs/ events, settings and configured policies).
Furthermore, our team is announcing the depreciation of the System Backup feature since September 2023 (see release notes starting EPP version 5.9.0.0) to prepare all customers to familiarize themselves with the alternatives.

Also as an alternative you can use the System Backup V2 and also you can do periodical snapshots from the virtualization environment.
Please let us know if this ticket can be closed.

Hi Team,

 

I tried to take server backup , and it did successfully for System Backup v2, but when I am trying to do System Backup it is not going beyond 99%. It is stuck at 99% for the last 3 hours.
