Ticket Number: 00436889
Ticket Subject: Entities Cannot Be Exported Due to Potential Low Disk Space 
(from Huawei)
Ticket Details: Dear Sir/Madam,

I submit this ticket on behalf of Huawei.

Currently, entities such as users and computers cannot be exported. There is 
no response after the Export button is clicked. The prompt shows the 
potential reason of this problem is low space disks. Please refer to the 
attached screenshots.

Until Feb 15, the system runs well.

Please help Huawei solve this problem. Thanks a lot in advance. (I prefer 
Adrian handle this ticket. He is always in charge of Huawei's case).

Thank you!

Adrian Draghici
