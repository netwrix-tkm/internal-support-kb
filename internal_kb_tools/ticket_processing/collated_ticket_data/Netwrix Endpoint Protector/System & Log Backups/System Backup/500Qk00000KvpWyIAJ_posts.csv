This costumer needs a quick backend check to unstuck a System Backup that they made. I already instructed them to not use this backup, and they will use VM or backup v2 but we need to fix the ones that broke in their side. Beside that, it would be good to take a look at their external repository.
The costumer is available in the 26th and 27th 14h BRT both days.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-22T14:34:10.000Z"
