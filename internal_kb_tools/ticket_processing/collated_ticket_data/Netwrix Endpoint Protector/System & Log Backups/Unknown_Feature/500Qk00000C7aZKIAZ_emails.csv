Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.


Best regards,

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Danylo,

Can we do a remote session with the customer please? I would need to access the back-end of the Server via SSH. Our server team requires additional data from the back-end.
Can we schedule for 11AM (Kyiv time) tomorrow?

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.





Kind regards

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.





Kind regards

There are 2 instances:

1. Production
2. Test

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

Can we do a remote session with the customer please? I would need to access the back-end of the Server via SSH. Our server team requires additional data from the back-end.
Can we schedule for 11AM (Kyiv time) tomorrow?


Kind regards

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.


Kind regards

There are 2 instances:

1. Production
2. Test

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.


Kind regards

There are 2 instances:

 

1. Production 

2. Test

 

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

 

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

 

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

 

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

There are 2 instances:

 

1. Production 

2. Test

 

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

 

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

 

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

 

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.





Kind regards

Hi,

Yes, this is correct. Only settings and policies. Logs are not needed on the test server.

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.


Kind regards

The total number of endpoints would be 50. Tests will be performed on a very limited number of workstations.

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.


Kind regards

There are 2 instances:

1. Production
2. Test

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.


Kind regards

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

There are 2 instances:

 

1. Production 

2. Test

 

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

 

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

 

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

 

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Thank you for your time on our call today. 
We have applied a procedure via the back-end of the Production Server to reduce the Backup v2 file size.  The result after applying the patch was that the backup v2 file was reduced to 69MB in size.  We also needed to reset the MFA and set the time manually on the Test Server in order for the customer to log in successfully after the backup configuration settings were restored.

Please confirm if we can go ahead and close this case now?

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

There are 2 instances:

 

1. Production 

2. Test

 

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

 

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

 

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

 

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.

Hi Danylo,

Can we do a remote session with the customer please? I would need to access the back-end of the Server via SSH. Our server team requires additional data from the back-end.
Can we schedule for 11AM (Kyiv time) tomorrow?


Kind regards

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.





Kind regards

Hi Andrew, Danylo

Thank you for your time on our call today.
We have applied a procedure via the back-end of the Production Server to reduce the Backup v2 file size.  The result after applying the patch was that the backup v2 file was reduced to 69MB in size.  We also needed to reset the MFA and set the time manually on the Test Server in order for the customer to log in successfully after the backup configuration settings were restored.

Please confirm if we can go ahead and close this case now?


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

There are 2 instances:

1. Production
2. Test

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.

Hello,

Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.


Best regards,

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.

Hi Andrew, Danylo

Thank you for your time on our call today. 
We have applied a procedure via the back-end of the Production Server to reduce the Backup v2 file size.  The result after applying the patch was that the backup v2 file was reduced to 69MB in size.  We also needed to reset the MFA and set the time manually on the Test Server in order for the customer to log in successfully after the backup configuration settings were restored.

Please confirm if we can go ahead and close this case now?

Hi Andrew,

Okay thank you for confirming. My apologies, I think I may have misunderstood the requirement here.   So the requirement will be to have only the settings and polices migrated to the test Server without the portion of the database that includes the event logs and entities (Computers, Users and devices etc.).  The SQL dump which I mentioned will migrate the complete database, which according to this requirement will not be feasible. I will discuss this internally tomorrow and get back to you with more information on what method we could use.


Kind regards

Hi Andrew,

We would need to optimize the new Test Server for the total number of endpoints that will be connecting to it in the future, so not the current 50 endpoints.
Yes please do propose a date and time for us to schedule a remote session.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for confirming the details.  Yes, we can schedule a remote session to perform the procedure to migrate the database.  First the recommend resources should be allocated and the new server will need to be optimized first before we can proceed with the procedure to migrate the database.

Please also let us know how many endpoints will be connecting to the EPP Server and also, which modules are active?
We can do the optimization of the new server and the migration of the SQL database in one session, I would recommend that we schedule a session for one hour and half.

Please let me know the date and time that the customer would be ready to do this.

There are 2 instances:

 

1. Production 

2. Test

 

We are trying to backup-restore the settings annd policies of the production server to the test one.

 

The test environment is needed to fix a bug which is present in the latest version of EPP in the client's environment.

 

Both prod and test are AWS instances.

 

Client is ready to migrate essentialy, should arrange a remote session to complete this task?

Hi Danylo,

I would like to give you an update and also confirm some details.

We can perform a procedure via the back-end of the customer's EPP Server to create a SQL dump, this means we create a copy of the existing database and then with this database file we can import it into the new server also via the back-end.

Can I ask you to confirm if the intention of the customer is to migrate from the existing EPP Server over to a new EPP Server also on AWS and if yes when would they like to migrate their EPP Server?  On the day of the migration we can assist with the transferal of the SQL database.

Hi Danylo,

Can we do a remote session with the customer please? I would need to access the back-end of the Server via SSH. Our server team requires additional data from the back-end.
Can we schedule for 11AM (Kyiv time) tomorrow?


Kind regards

Hello,
 
Unfortunately, customer cannot update the server to 5.9.3.0 because of the issue: ""00409929 PrivatBank massive issues after EPP server upgrade"".
So, we need backup v2 to transfer all settings and policies to additional test EPP server, to make some test regarding major issue.

Hi Danylo,

Can we ask the customer to upgrade their EPP appliance to version 5.9.3.0 and then check if the issue persists please?

Please note to them to create a snapshot of their EPP Appliance prior to applying the 5930 update patch.


Kind regards

Hello Danylo,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The backup v2 file seems to be unusual big in size, there may be an underlying problem on the EPP appliance and we will need to investigate this in a remote session.  I would like to consult internally with our server team regarding this issue and will get back to you with some feedback.  For now can I ask that you provide us with a full page screenshot of the system information page please?, see below example.





Kind regards
