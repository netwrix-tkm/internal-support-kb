Customer name is PrivatBank.
They are migrating EPP policies and settings from the prod server to test EPP server.
To complete that, the customer created System backup v2 to copy all EPP settings.
Created backup seems to be 2GB weight in the EPP console, but after customer clicked on the download, the actual downloading weight is about 14 GB.
Could you please clarify if it is an expected behavior?
Attaching screenshot:","","","","Case was resolved by back-end procedure. Policies and Settings were migrated successfully after applying an php patch, the new backup v2 file was 69MB in size.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","System & Log Backups","","NONE","","26.1","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-06-21T12:19:10.000Z","2024-07-17T15:06:19.000Z"
