"500Qk00000Jhca9IAB","00430327","Support Ticket","OTP not working","Hello,

first I want to mention that we are on server version 5.9.4.1 and client version 6.2.4.1006.
Since the client update to 6.2.4.1006 the OTP is not working anymore. When we try to create an OTP password for example for CAP or Device Control and paste the Code in the EPP client, there is always the message ""invalid unlock code"".
We made the test with a client with the old version 6.2.3.1010 and there it worked. Once I updated the client to the new version, it did not work anymore.
I also collected the logs while reproducing the issue.
Please review this issue as soon as possible. The OTP is an essential part of EPP and if this is not working anymore, it is a big issue.

Thank you!","","","","Provided the customer with the offline patch that includes the OTP fix:
