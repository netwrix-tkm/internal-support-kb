I have called you 3 times, I could hear you but unfortunately I think the microphone(s) on my side did not work.

Please let me know some time intervals when you have availability for a remote session so we can take a look together and I will send you a Zoom invite.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we adjusted / re-synced the time on the EPP server and after that the OTP codes worked.

Regarding the migration, please find the steps below:

1. Please raise a separate ticket for the migration
2. Please create a Snapshot of the EPP server before our first meeting
3. During our first meeting we will scope out the EPP server:
- check logs
- check database
- check resources
- delete non-necessary files to clear-up space
- schedule audit log backups(may take a few days)
4. We will schedule a second meeting after the Audit Log backup finishes
5. Please create another Snapshot of the EPP server
6. We will migrate the EPP server to the latest ubuntu version we have available
7. We will upgrade the EPP server to the latest EPP server version we have available.

Note: The EPP clients will also need to be upgraded.

We are closing this ticket for now.
