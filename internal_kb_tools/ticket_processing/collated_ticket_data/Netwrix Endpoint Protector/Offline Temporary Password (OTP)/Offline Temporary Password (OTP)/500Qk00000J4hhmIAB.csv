"500Qk00000J4hhmIAB","00428764","Support Ticket","OTP for all devices","Hi, i have a little question about a OTP Password for ""all devices"" if no specific device can be selected beforehand.
Untill a few weeks ago we only created OTP Passwords for specific devices. Now we had a few cases where some employees went to appointments where they had no internet access. How long do these ""OTP Passwords for all devices"" remain active und usable? 
The employees had made a request about a week beforehand but were unable to activate the password on the day of the appointment to use something like ClickShare because the OTP Password was invalid. Is there any deadline? Or should a OTP Password for all devices still work after one or more weeks? I just want to make sure because i don't know if the employees might have done something wrong or copied in a space, etc.

Thank you","","","","Explanaition provided, customer confirmed it can be closed","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","","","22.0","Closed - Resolved","AOK - Die Gesundheitskasse f√ºr Niedersachsen","Stefan Nanninga","2024-12-04T07:34:59.000Z","2024-12-26T07:19:27.000Z"
