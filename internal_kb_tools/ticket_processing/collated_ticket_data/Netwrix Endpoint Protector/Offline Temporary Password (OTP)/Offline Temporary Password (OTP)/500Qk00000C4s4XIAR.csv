When power came back, the server needed a file system repair so I hit 'f' and it booted. WebUI was working and i didn't see any other errors. Later that day a user tried to issue a temp password to another user to mount an external drive and the drive wouldn't mount. I tested on a different client and it didn't work there either. 
thanks, Andy","","","","Re-synced server time -> OTP codes worked after that.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","NBC Universal","andrew peach","2024-06-20T14:50:13.000Z","2024-06-20T19:17:20.000Z"
