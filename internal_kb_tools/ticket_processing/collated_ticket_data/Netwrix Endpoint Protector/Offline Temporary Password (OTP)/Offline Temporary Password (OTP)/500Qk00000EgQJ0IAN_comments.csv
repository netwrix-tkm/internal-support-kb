@WaitingOnEngineerÂ What you see is not a bug. When you enter a CAP OTP code, epp-client does not load CAP policies. You can see the ""Skipping policy load because a CAP password is in effect."" message in the logs, and also the ""OTP status: Active CAP: x..."" message. So when a CAP OTP code is active, epp-client does not populate the active policies list, and when this list is empty, the CAP tab is hidden.
