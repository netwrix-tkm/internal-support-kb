We think that this problem begin after updating the console and agents to last version.","","","","What you see is not a bug. When you enter a CAP OTP code, epp-client does not load CAP policies. You can see the ""Skipping policy load because a CAP password is in effect."" message in the logs, and also the ""OTP status: Active CAP: x..."" message. So when a CAP OTP code is active, epp-client does not populate the active policies list, and when this list is empty, the CAP tab is hidden.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","Offline Temporary Password (OTP)","","","76.0","Closed - Resolved","AconSeg","Mariano Amigo","2024-08-20T14:57:34.000Z","2024-11-04T14:47:13.000Z"
