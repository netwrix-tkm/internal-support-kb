"500Qk00000DMfwHIAT","00415575","Support Ticket","Device Entity is Not Available when Requesting Blocked Devices OTP","Hi Support, 
We received report from two different customer that they encountered issue when requesting an OTP for blocked device. 
The OTP request form shows only the ""Universal"" rather than displaying devices.
This was occured on the EPP client version 6.2.2.1006, 6.2.2.2005.
Could this issue be a result of the recent hotfix update? 
We will request the logs this afternoon for further investigation and provide them to you.

Regards,
