We wanted to test SSO in our POC. The test button used the same window as we used to configure SSO itself, but it seems like the button also killed the session and we do not know the nonSSO login url.

Can you pls send us the nonSSO Fallback URL or deactivate SSO? 

We did not find more information than this little Single Sign ON part:

Is there a detailed documentation to configure Endpoint Protector with Azure / Entra ID for SSO?
