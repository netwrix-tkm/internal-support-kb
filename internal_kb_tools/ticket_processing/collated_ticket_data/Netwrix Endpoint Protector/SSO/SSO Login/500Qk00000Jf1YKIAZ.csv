Following a recent EPP server upgrade performed via the portal, we are experiencing login issues. We use Entra ID for authentication, but since the upgrade, we are caught in an authentication loop whenever we attempt to log in.

Could you please investigate this issue and determine the cause of the authentication loop?

We have been unable to access the platform since the upgrade, which is now impacting our business operations.

Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Regards,
