After update GA 5.9.4.1 yesterday, we are not able to SSO login to NEP portal this morning, there was a looping at <a href='https://login.microsoft.com/login.srf' target='_blank'>login.microsoft.com/login.srf</a> (we integrated with Azure)
Please note that after updated yesterday, we were still SSO login to the portal, the issue just happened since this morning 
Request to have a remote session to re producing the issue and fix it as soon as possible
Thank you","","","","backend procedure no. 68","","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SSO","SSO Login","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","TrustingSocial","Linh Hoang","2024-12-18T07:20:54.000Z","2024-12-18T08:20:47.000Z"
