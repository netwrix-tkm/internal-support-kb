"500Qk00000Opv4sIAB","00444170","Support Ticket","SSO Admin permissions","Hello,

We have recently configured SSO with MS Entra and a user group has been assigned. However, I do not see a full dashboard with my account comparing the non-SSO dashboard. Is it expected or a known issue? I think I should've have the same access as before.
Could someone have a look please?

Best,
Kerem","","- By default, SSO users may not be granted Superadmin permissions unless explicitly configured.
- The SSO configuration includes an option to ""Import users as super-administrators."" If this option is not enabled during setup, SSO users will not have full admin rights.
- Enabling the ""Import users as super-administrators"" option after initial setup does not retroactively grant Superadmin rights to existing SSO users.
- The permissions for SSO users can be manually updated in the System Configuration > System Administrator page by editing the user and assigning the required permissions.
- The customer was able to resolve the issue for their account by updating permissions manually and inquired about applying the same fix for other SSO users.","1. For any additional SSO users who require Superadmin access, update their permissions in System Configuration > System Administrator by editing each user and assigning the appropriate role.
2. If new SSO users are added in the future, ensure their permissions are reviewed and updated as needed.
3. If further issues arise with SSO permissions or dashboard access, contact support for additional troubleshooting.","The issue was resolved by manually updating the SSO userâ€™s permissions in System Configuration > System Administrator, granting Superadmin rights. The same process can be applied to other SSO users as needed. No further action is required, and the customer has confirmed the ticket can be closed.","Best Practices Question","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SSO","SSO Login","","","8.0","Closed - Resolved","Helsing","Kerem Sevil","2025-05-06T10:14:40.000Z","2025-05-14T09:55:01.000Z"
