Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have successfully fixed the AD issue, by adding the suffix to the settings. 

We have tested with two users and both of them manage to login.

Since the issue is now solved, we will proceed with the closure of this case. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
