"500Qk00000JXXgbIAH","00429910","Support Ticket","Latest update SSO issue","Good morning,

I applied the following update this morning ""5.9.4.1 - Product Maintenance - Netwrix Endpoint ..."" Since then it seems to have broken the SSO log in, admins can no longer log into the management portal for EPP.

Whenever anyone tries to log in they select there account and it just takes you back to asking for your account again and never logs in.

Luckily as I was logged in before the update I can still get in but if I try and log in on another browser I have the same issue, so I expect to get locked out soon.

Checking through the sign-in logs it shows admin user's as logging in successfully but they never get to the portal.

Some information in case I can't get back on later :

Link we use to log in - <a href='https://endpointprotector/index.php/login' target='_blank'>https://endpointprotector/index.php/login</a>
Server ID:PBGU2VNR
Server I.P - 10.110.0.37

Many Thanks
