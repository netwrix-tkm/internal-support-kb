Hi Andy,

We hope you are doing well.

In order to add a SSL Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.

Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated(certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Hi Andy,

We hope you are doing well.

In order to add a SSL Certificate please navigate to the EPP UI > Appliance > Server Maintenance.

Once a .pem SSL Certificate is generated(certificate.pem and key.pem), their content can be pasted in the self signing certificate tabs and then saved.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Hi Andy,

Please let me know the below:

1. Is the EPP server hosted on your end?
2. Is the EPP server hosted on a VM, AWS, Azure or GCP platform?
3. Please let me know if you have availability this Tuesday, Thursday or Friday for a remote session so we can take a look together.

The certificate looks to be installed, but the UI keeps going to https://10.3.4.139/index.php/ instead of  https://epp.adtscore.net/index.php.

 

Have tried on a couple of different machines and browsers, including incognito mode.
