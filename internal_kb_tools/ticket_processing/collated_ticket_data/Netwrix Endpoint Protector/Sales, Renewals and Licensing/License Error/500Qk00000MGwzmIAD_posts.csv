Just for clarity’s sake, we are still on your Emergency Licence instead of the now provided set of 1800 Licences from A23 because I wanted to get this issue sorted with Licencing first, as I am worried we do not have enough.

Okay so, within Licences we are currently showing:
 

When I go to Automatic Licence Renewal and set for 15 days, it has not changed any of the Used licences.
When I look through the Filters of Licences, there are none showing in any of the larger Last Seen Date selections.

However, when I go to Computers, and Filter by Licenced/Offline and Sort by oldest date seen, we have over a few thousand that have not been seen since 2020.

Sadly, from the Computers screen it looks like you cannot bulk unassign Licences. So instead what I tried was Deleting three of the oldest ones. Hoping that when I got back to Licence screen, I would see the above go to 2400.
Sadly, It is now saying 2404 and I don’t know if those license were released from the ones I deleted.

Can you please let me know if I am doing something stupid and missing some options?","","","","0050g000005zo5JAAQ","2025-02-25T06:55:07.000Z"
