"500Qk00000MGwzmIAD","00436872","Support Ticket","Endpoint Protector license and usage","I have a question about the Licences and Automatic Licence Renewal. Just for clarity’s sake, we are still on your Emergency Licence instead of the now provided set of 1800 Licences from A23 because I wanted to get this issue sorted with Licencing first, as I am worried we do not have enough.

Okay so, within Licences we are currently showing:
 

When I go to Automatic Licence Renewal and set for 15 days, it has not changed any of the Used licences.
When I look through the Filters of Licences, there are none showing in any of the larger Last Seen Date selections.

However, when I go to Computers, and Filter by Licenced/Offline and Sort by oldest date seen, we have over a few thousand that have not been seen since 2020.

Sadly, from the Computers screen it looks like you cannot bulk unassign Licences. So instead what I tried was Deleting three of the oldest ones. Hoping that when I got back to Licence screen, I would see the above go to 2400.
Sadly, It is now saying 2404 and I don’t know if those license were released from the ones I deleted.

Can you please let me know if I am doing something stupid and missing some options?","","","","We may be in touch at a later date for some help with licence or computer control but for now this is not being actioned further yet.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Sales, Renewals and Licensing","License Error","NONE","","22.0","Closed - Resolved","Queensland Treasury","Finn Ruth-Duffy","2025-02-25T06:55:06.000Z","2025-03-19T07:19:07.000Z"
