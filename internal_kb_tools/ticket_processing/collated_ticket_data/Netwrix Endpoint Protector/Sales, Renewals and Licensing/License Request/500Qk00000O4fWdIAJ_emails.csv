Hello,

An email was sent to you as a reply to the renewal request that contains the license file.
I have attached it to this email.
Please let me know if you can download the license file and import it to the Epp server.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

We have checked internally with our team. We do not have the licence file with us.
Is there a way to get the licence file to have it updated on the EPP portal?

Request you to please check and help us.

Thanks & Regards

Hello,

After placing the renewal order, did you receive a license file?
You will need to import that license file under ""System Configuration > System Licensing"" by clicking on the Import Licenses button.

Kind regards
