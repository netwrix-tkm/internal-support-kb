Hi,

 

Over the weekend I was trying to do the hotfix 1.1 patch but it had been working since then until about 10:20am South African Standard time today.

It seems that the appliance is having a really high load and we belive this could be generated by a high number of devices -
especially devices of type 45 - Network Printers.
I am attaching here a screenshot with the total number of devices and the network printers - type 45:



This is actually generated by a situation in which the network printers are being duplicated, and which has a fix in version 5930 of our server. Currently you are running version 5920.

What we can do now is to delete the latest added duplicates and then when we will have the server will less load and much stable to apply the latest version -5930 which, how I said contains a fix for this situation.

We can even have a call today. I am available in 30 minutes starting from now if this would be suitable for you.

Very happy to have a call with you today.  I have some time available.  Can we do teams of Zoom?


We should also only have less than 100 network printers.

Dear Shaun,

The appliance is up and running now and the load is much lower - from 70 to 0.30

[cid:image002.png@01DAD2F1.01EEA7E0]


We can have a session tomorrow scheduled if time permits to upgrade the appliance.
Please send me a few timeframes when you will be available.

Hi Adrian,

Very happy to have a call with you today.  I have some time available.  Can we do teams of Zoom?


We should also only have less than 100 network printers.

Hi Shaun,

It seems that the appliance is having a really high load and we belive this could be generated by a high number of devices -
especially devices of type 45 - Network Printers.
I am attaching here a screenshot with the total number of devices and the network printers - type 45:

[cid:image003.png@01DAD2F1.01EEA7E0]

This is actually generated by a situation in which the network printers are being duplicated, and which has a fix in version 5930 of our server. Currently you are running version 5920.

What we can do now is to delete the latest added duplicates and then when we will have the server will less load and much stable to apply the latest version -5930 which, how I said contains a fix for this situation.

We can even have a call today. I am available in 30 minutes starting from now if this would be suitable for you.
