I'm pasting below the details received from customer Bowman Gilfillan a few minutes ago:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

 

I have tried logging a ticket with Netwrix and their system has been hanging for the last 17 minutes.  We need urgent support as we are getting the following error on our system hosted by CoSoSys.

 

Warning: mkdir() [function.mkdir]: No space left on device in /var/www/EPPServer/lib/cache/sfFileCache.class.php on line 482

 

Please assist urgent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please let us know if other details are needed.

Thank you,
Oana","","","","This ticket was closed by cleaning the journal in the root partition.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Website and Documentation","Customer Portal","","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Bowman Gilfillan","Shaun Morris","2024-07-10T09:01:53.000Z","2024-07-11T06:42:37.000Z"
