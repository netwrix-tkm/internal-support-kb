Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we re-optimized the resources to the current existing ones(6 CPU cores 24GB of RAM). Currently there are about 6500 endpoints connected to the EPP server.

We strongly recommend that in the future to increase the resources that are currently allocated in case you notice drops in performances:
- CPU: from 6 to 12 or 16 cores
- RAM: from 24GB to 32GB of RAM

Our server team has increased the CPUs to 12, and increased the RAM to 32. Please let me know when you can come back in and reoptimize. I am available for the next hour.

 

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we re-optimized the resources to the current existing ones(6 CPU cores 24GB of RAM). Currently there are about 6500 endpoints connected to the EPP server.

We strongly recommend that in the future to increase the resources that are currently allocated in case you notice drops in performances:
- CPU: from 6 to 12 or 16 cores
- RAM: from 24GB to 32GB of RAM

We are closing this ticket.

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we optimized the EPP server for the new resources that were added(12 cores + 32 GB of RAM).

The server seems to be performing better. In case you encounter performance issues in the future we can further increase the CPU core count + optimize the EPP server for the new resources.

We are closing this ticket.
