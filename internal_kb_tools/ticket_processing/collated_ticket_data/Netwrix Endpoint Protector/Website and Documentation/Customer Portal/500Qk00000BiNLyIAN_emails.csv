We have just received an update from our colleagues today on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow or any day next week and we will take a look together over some settings and make some changes.

We would also ask, if it is possible, to have access to a computer where the EPP client is installed. We would like to uninstall it and re-install it.
