"500Qk00000EflPYIAZ","00418564","Support Ticket","CentOS 7 Support","We currently run on an older version of EPP server and EPP client. We are considering future upgrade options for our system, and would like to understand what options we may have with EPP.

Thank you in advance for answering these questions!

•Current EPP server version: 5.1.0.2
•Current EPP client version: 1.3.1.5

Questions:
•Does EPP still support operating in an offline/disconnected environment? Our system has no access to the Internet.
•Does EPP still support CentOS 7? We currently run CentOS 7.6.1810.
•Does EPP support newer distributions, such as CentOS 8, Rocky Linux 8, or Alma Linux 8?","","","","Closing Ticket as questions were answered and no additional information is needed at this time.
