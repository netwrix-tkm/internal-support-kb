"500Qk00000CwcduIAB","00414781","Support Ticket","Issue with Device Whitelisting Process","I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we have been experiencing with the device whitelisting process over the past two weeks. Previously, when users submitted a whitelisting request, our admin team could easily find and select the devices from the list of existing devices. Additionally, we could identify devices by either the device code or the serial number, streamlining the whitelisting process.

However, recently, we have encountered a problem where the list of existing devices is no longer populating. As a result, we have had to manually enter all device details to whitelist them, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. Furthermore, our attempts to locate devices using the device code or serial number have also been unsuccessful.

Could you please investigate this issue and provide us with a solution? We would greatly appreciate any assistance you can offer to restore the previous functionality, which significantly eased the whitelisting process.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.","","","","Solved by customer","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","","","","7.8","Closed - Resolved","Feral Interactive","feral feral","2024-07-11T14:41:14.000Z","2024-07-19T10:11:56.000Z"
