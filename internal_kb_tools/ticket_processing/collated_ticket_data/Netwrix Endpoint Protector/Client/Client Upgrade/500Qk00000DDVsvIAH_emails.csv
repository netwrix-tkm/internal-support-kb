We have just very recently received the Offline Client patch for the EPP clients containing the fix on the client side. This will allow you to upgrade from the EPP server side the EPP clients. please follow the below steps:

1. Download the below Offline Client patch on your computer:
http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz

2. Please go to Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader.

3. Browse for the downloaded Offline Client Patch.

4. Select Upload Patch and wait a few minutes till you receive a green message.

5. After receiving the green message check the Dashboard -> Live Update to see if the installation was completed(if there is a progress bar and if it reached 100%).

6. Check System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and see if the EPP clients with the Vulnerability ix are there(6.2.2.2 and 3.0.2.2).

Please let me know if these steps work for you.
