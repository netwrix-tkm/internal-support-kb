Thanks for reaching out!

Are there old upgrade jobs that are pending or finished? If there are could you please delete them? If you need them for audit purposes, you can download a report of them in Excel, PDF or CSV:


Usually this fixes the issue of not upgrading.

If you can delete them, and you're still encountering the issue, please let me know and we'll schedule a remote session, we will also need a user on whose computer the client is not upgrading.

Please note that we are not available on the 18th and 21st due to public holiday - Easter.

Hey Botond,

11:00 CET sounds great for me. What is your used communication medium?
Please send me an invitation.

Is the session planned to be in English or German? I would prefer German, but English is also okay for me.

Hey Botond,

 

11:00 CET sounds great for me. What is your used communication medium? 

Please send me an invitation.  

 

Is the session planned to be in English or German? I would prefer German, but English is also okay for me. 

Thanks for the quick reply, and I looking forward to hear you tomorrow 11:00.

Hello Bonton,

 

I tried to delete every single upgrade process. But have the same result at the end.

Hi Jonas,

Thanks for reaching out!

Are there old upgrade jobs that are pending or finished? If there are could you please delete them? If you need them for audit purposes, you can download a report of them in Excel, PDF or CSV:


Usually this fixes the issue of not upgrading.

If you can delete them, and you're still encountering the issue, please let me know and we'll schedule a remote session, we will also need a user on whose computer the client is not upgrading.

Please note that we are not available on the 18th and 21st due to public holiday - Easter.

Hi Jonas,

We use Zoom for remote sessions, because Teams can be problematic at times.
I can provide support in English, but if you wish, I can ask one of my colleagues to take over, but I don't know their availability.

I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.
You can also join via the following link:
