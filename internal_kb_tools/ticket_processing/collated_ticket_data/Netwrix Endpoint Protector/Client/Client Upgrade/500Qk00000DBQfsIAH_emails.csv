In addition to applying the hotfix to the EPP Server Appliance, you will also need to upgrade the EPP clients.

We have also made the offline patch available EPP clients that includes the vulnerability fixes.   First you will need to import the EPP clients that contains the hotix into the EPP Server Appliance.
Please use the link below to download the offline patch.

http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz

To apply the patch:

    Please Navigate to EPP User Interface > ""Dashboard"" > ""Live Update""  > ""Offline Patch Uploader"" and select the archive 'MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz' which you have downloaded and then click on ""Upload Patch"".
    Return to ""Live Update"" and wait for the progress bar to reach 100% and only after that the new EPP clients will be available on your EPP Server Appliance


Please follow the below steps to upgrade your endpoint / computers to the latest client software version currently available on your server:

1. Click on ""System Configuration"" > ""Client Software Upgrade""





2. Select the computers that you wish to upgrade (Instead of selecting all, select about 20) and then click on ""Next""





3. Confirm the upgrade job and click on ""Start Upgrade Job""




Could you give the above steps a try and let us know if successful please?

Kind regards

Hi Sébastien,

In addition to applying the hotfix to the EPP Server Appliance, you will also need to upgrade the EPP clients.

We have also made the offline patch available EPP clients that includes the vulnerability fixes.   First you will need to import the EPP clients that contains the hotix into the EPP Server Appliance.
Please use the link below to download the offline patch.

http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz

To apply the patch:

    Please Navigate to EPP User Interface > ""Dashboard"" > ""Live Update""  > ""Offline Patch Uploader"" and select the archive 'MP-HWA-EPP4-U0088-M0002.tar.gz' which you have downloaded and then click on ""Upload Patch"".
    Return to ""Live Update"" and wait for the progress bar to reach 100% and only after that the new EPP clients will be available on your EPP Server Appliance


Please follow the below steps to upgrade your endpoint / computers to the latest client software version currently available on your server:

1. Click on ""System Configuration"" > ""Client Software Upgrade""

<Image_2024-07-17_16-56-11.png>



2. Select the computers that you wish to upgrade (Instead of selecting all, select about 20) and then click on ""Next""

<Image_2024-07-17_16-56-49.png>



3. Confirm the upgrade job and click on ""Start Upgrade Job""

<Image_2024-07-17_16-57-45.png>


Could you give the above steps a try and let us know if successful please?

Kind regards

Hello Sebastien,

Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector support team.

The hotfix will need to be applied manually to the EPP Server, this can be done under ""Dashboard"" > ""Live Update"".  I can assist you with the applying of the hotfix on a remote session, are you available tomorrow at 9AM Paris time so that we can do this on a call?
