I hope this message finds you well. Our R&D team got back to us reporting that they fixed this issue on the following test build:

https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp21032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.0111.zip

This can be tested by installing any older EPP version(such as the 6.2.3.1xxx from 5.9.4.0) and upgrade it to the test build that we have provided. 

Also, please make sure the department is changed to the custom one before applying the upgrade.

The upgrade can be made by using the GUI installer or using command line.

Please test this on 2-3 devices and let me know if it works accordingly.

Looking forward to your response.
