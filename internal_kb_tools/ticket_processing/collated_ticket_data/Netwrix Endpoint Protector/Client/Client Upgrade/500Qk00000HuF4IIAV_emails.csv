Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. My name is Zach and I will be assisting you with your issue. Can you please test the following for me? 

Go to System Parameters >> Advanced Scanning Exceptions

In the Application Process Name field, enter the process name for Outlook that is seen in Task Manager i.e. outlook.exe or olk.exe

Click Add to Content

In the Whitelisted Applications box, select outlook or if you already populated this box, select all that apply to your environment, then click Generate.

On a machine seeing the issue, update the policies, then test to see if that resolves the issue

 

If you would like, we can have a remote session where I can walk you through this.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Can you do the same steps again, but this time instead of typing in the process exe, can you type in the word ""Outlook"" without the quotes, then click generate. Then select the checkbox of the newly created ""Outlook"" from the Whitelisted Applications box and click Generate. Then, on the machine seeing the issue, update the policies, close out of Outlook and relaunch, then have them test one more time.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
