"500Qk00000CszvmIAB","00414645","Support Ticket","How to update the clients (Hotfix)","Hi, in the past I downloaded the client directly from the EPP Server website and unchecked the following:
Install with Outlook Add-on
Install with Internet Explorer Add-on
Install with Lotus Notes Add-on

I got a file named: EPPClientSetup.6.2.2.1006_x86_64_[<a href='https://a=qpwf354.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>a=qpwf354.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>,o=0,n=0].msi
Regarding the Hotfix, I downloaded the client from the Netwrix security center website and the file is named: <a href='https://EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi' target='_blank'>EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi</a>
I also checked to download from the EPP Server but it is still showing the ""old"" version.
Now I'm not sure if A) the AddIns are included or not (We prefer not to have the AddIns installed) and B) if the information, that is added to the filename when downloading from the server, is necessary for the installation. If yes would it be sufficient just to adjust the filename?
Thanks in advance.
Best Regards
