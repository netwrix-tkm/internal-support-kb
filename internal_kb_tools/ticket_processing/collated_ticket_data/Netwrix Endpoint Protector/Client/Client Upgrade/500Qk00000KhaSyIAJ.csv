"500Qk00000KhaSyIAJ","00432488","Support Ticket","Very slow progress on the Client Software Upgrade job","Hi Team,

Regina Maria team reached out to me mentioning that they are currently working to upgrade their clients to version 6.2.4.1006 to fix the interoperability with Bitdefender described within the release notes for 5.9.4.1. (Improved Stealthy DPI Interoperability
with Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools / #319842 / EPPSUPPORT-3713, page 21: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_EndpointProtector_5.9.4_BugFixList.pdf).

An upgrade job was created for this purpose under System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade, but very little progress is seen for it. 
Server version is 5.9.4.1.

When replying, please also add following email address: it.security@reginamaria.ro
