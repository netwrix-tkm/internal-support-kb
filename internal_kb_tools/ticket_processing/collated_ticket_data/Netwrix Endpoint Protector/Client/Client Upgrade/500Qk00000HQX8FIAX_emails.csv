Hello dear Adrian and thank you for attending the meeting and spending some of your valuable time to discuss about this subject!
Instead of sending you a video containing screenshots of the steps to create a deployment policy in the active directory because I believe that I exactly did what is mentioned in that file, I will send you something else that got my attention. The attached screenshot shows a message that appeared to me when I run a command to force the group policy to be applied on the testing machine. It seems that the steps of deploying a software installer work partially, but there is something preventing them from completion. I searched the Internet for a workaround, but nothing seems to work. The suggested workaround is to enable two more policies to make the deployment gets executed completely. I tried multiple times with different systems and different software installers, but nothing worked unfortunately.

Note: The two policies are “Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon” and “Specify startup policy processing wait time”.

Hello dear Adrian and thank you for attending the meeting and spending some of your valuable time to discuss about this subject!

Instead of sending you a video containing screenshots of the steps to create a deployment policy in the active directory because I believe that I exactly did what is mentioned in that file, I will send you something else that got my attention. The attached screenshot shows a message that appeared to me when I run a command to force the group policy to be applied on the testing machine. It seems that the steps of deploying a software installer work partially, but there is something preventing them from completion. I searched the Internet for a workaround, but nothing seems to work. The suggested workaround is to enable two more policies to make the deployment gets executed completely. I tried multiple times with different systems and different software installers, but nothing worked unfortunately.

 

Note: The two policies are “Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon” and “Specify startup policy processing wait time”.

Dear Hamad, I double checked and unfortunately we do not have any other User Manual regarding the AD deployment, but along with my colleagues from the QA department we made some searches and found a video on youtube that helped us with the deployment.

Hello dear Adrian and thank you for attending the meeting and spending some of your valuable time to discuss about this subject!
Instead of sending you a video containing screenshots of the steps to create a deployment policy in the active directory because I believe that I exactly did what is mentioned in that file, I will send you something else that got my attention. The attached screenshot shows a message that appeared to me when I run a command to force the group policy to be applied on the testing machine. It seems that the steps of deploying a software installer work partially, but there is something preventing them from completion. I searched the Internet for a workaround, but nothing seems to work. The suggested workaround is to enable two more policies to make the deployment gets executed completely. I tried multiple times with different systems and different software installers, but nothing worked unfortunately.

Note: The two policies are “Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon” and “Specify startup policy processing wait time”.
