"500Qk00000HQX8FIAX","00424955","Support Ticket","Unable to upgrade the version of a client via the management server.","Our Customer Saudi Chevron cannot upgrade their clients via the Client Software Upgrade feature.
I asked them to try with 2 different scenarios with 2 versions of the client just to see if the error code is the same in the eppclient.log file and it seems that the error codes are different.
The 1st scenario was: when you upgrade the existing old client to version 5928 - this would represent an intermediary version so that we can see if the error is the same as for the latest versions.
The 2nd scenario was: when you upgrade the “6.2.1.2” on a system and then sent an upgrade to version “6.2.2.1”","Pushing the client upgrade from Client Software Upgrade menu (they are currently at 5940 with their server version) and the clients are having 5928","","","The customer confirmed that we can close the ticket and he will get back if any problems will be encountered.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","-","40.8","Closed - Resolved","Saudi Chevron Phillips Co","Hamad Aldossary","2024-10-24T13:09:50.000Z","2024-12-04T08:54:18.000Z"
