"500Qk00000IH1gUIAT","00426972","Support Ticket","Likely Quick Question on Feature Update","I just wanted to find out the exact differences users may notice on their end device when we do the feature update from 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0, especially with the soft rebranding. Some users spook easy and it would be good to give them the info beforehand. Thank you!","","","","Upgrading the EPP server from 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0 will bring no visible changes to the end users. The functionalities and policies that are currently in place will also remain.

Upgrading the EPP clients from the current version that you have to the latest will however bring an update to the EPP client icon logo which is present in the tray(Windows) or in the top bar(macOS). It will change from the ""stoplight"" to the Netwrix logo.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Arity","James Ceart","2024-11-13T18:23:35.000Z","2024-11-13T22:15:44.000Z"
