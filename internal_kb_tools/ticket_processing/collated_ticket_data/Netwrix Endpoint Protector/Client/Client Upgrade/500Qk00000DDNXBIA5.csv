"500Qk00000DDNXBIA5","00415323","Support Ticket","Requesting AMI for Redeployment of EPP on-premise server","I am requesting (again) an AMI for EPP server to redeploy in our environment.  While we previously thought that the work to upgrade the server to latest was more uplift than any benefits, our CISO countermanded and stated that he would like the EPP server to be upgraded.

Answering some questions from before:
1. Is the EPP server hosted on your end and on what platform(AWS, Azure, GCP)?
AWS

2. What is the current EPP server version that you are on(it is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the EPP UI)?
5.9.3.0

3. If we migrate the EPP server are you interested in migrating the:
- Settings, Policies, Computers, without the logs
- including the logs
- starting from a fresh image(nothing imported from the current/old EPP server)
Would like to migrate all settings for device control and EasyLock.  No need to copy over logs.  Current server will need to be upgrade to net-new EPP server that is using an up-to-date backend OS.

If it is hosted in the cloud(AWS, Azure, GCP):
4. What is the Region?
us-east-1

5. What is the Account ID?
245785830155

Other info:
Name- Sharecare Inc
Company email- <a href='https://siteops@sharecare.com' target='_blank'>siteops@sharecare.com</a>

Please let me know when the AMI is available for our SiteOps team to spin up.","","","","1. Upgraded the new EPP server to the same version as the old one(5930 + vulnerability patch).
2. We migrated the database from the old EPP server to the new one.
3. We checked to make sure that the new and old EPP servers 1-to-1 copies of each other.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","8.0","Closed - Resolved","Sharecare","Taylor Summers","2024-07-17T20:26:31.000Z","2024-07-25T20:52:24.000Z"
