Please follow the below steps to generate some log files on one of the affected laptops. We will need these logs and some dump files in order to further investigate the issue with our devs.
For the logs please find below the steps and the download link for the EPP Support Tool.
 
Please be aware that local administrator rights are needed on the computer in order to run this tool.
 
EPP Support Tool link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/SupportTools/Support_Tool_Windows.zip
 
Extract the 2 applications from the archive to a separate/different folder(Ex: C:DesktopSupportTool) and select the correct one 32bit or 64bit based on your Windows OS.
 
Please find the steps below on how to run the EPP Support Tool and run it on one of the computers that have the issue.
 
Please run it as administrator and then, from the drop down menu select Create Appended Log File and hit execute.

 
Once the log files are created please update the EPP Client policies and then try to reproduce the issue(allow the issue to occur). The log files will be created under root C: drive.

After the issue has been reproduced a few times, from the EPP Support Tool please select Export Files and after that Create Achieve(Scroll down menu where Create Log File is) and Execute. This will copy the log files to the location where the Support Tool was installed/run and archive them.
 
This is how the archive should look like:

 
And here are the files it should contain(without the eppsslsplit file):


Please send us these logs and the dump files from one of the affected computers and we will investigate the issue with our devs.

I checked internally and we did not receive any notifications from any of our customers receiving BSOD with our latest EPP clients.

Is there any way you could send us a dump file so we can further check the issue internally?

We have discovered we can boot to safe mode, and if we rename the driver file causing the blue screen we can boot again.  The driver is cssdlp20.sys.  I assume EPP is no longer working once we do that though.

I didn't finish my thoughts on the last one.  So, yes, we should be able to fully uninstall once we do those steps.

Can you please uninstall it and after that we can schedule a remote session and try to install the client again and see how it reacts.

If the issue occurs again maybe we can recover the dump files so we can pass them over to our devs so they can further investigate this issue.

We can also try deploying another EPP client version to see if the issue occurs with another version as well, or only with that specific client version.

I didn't finish my thoughts on the last one.  So, yes, we should be able to fully uninstall once we do those steps.

Hi Kevin,

Apologies for the misunderstanding. I thought that the computers work for a while after a reboot and then go in blue screen.

Is there any way to remove the applications from the computer? or bring them to a state that it was prior to installing the EPP client?

But the machines go into a blue screen state where they will never boot up properly.  How would we run this software?

Hi Kevin,

Please follow the below steps to generate some log files on one of the affected laptops. We will need these logs and some dump files in order to further investigate the issue with our devs.
For the logs please find below the steps and the download link for the EPP Support Tool.
 
Please be aware that local administrator rights are needed on the computer in order to run this tool.
 
EPP Support Tool link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/SupportTools/Support_Tool_Windows.zip
 
Extract the 2 applications from the archive to a separate/different folder(Ex: C:DesktopSupportTool) and select the correct one 32bit or 64bit based on your Windows OS.
 
Please find the steps below on how to run the EPP Support Tool and run it on one of the computers that have the issue.
 
Please run it as administrator and then, from the drop down menu select Create Appended Log File and hit execute.

 
Once the log files are created please update the EPP Client policies and then try to reproduce the issue(allow the issue to occur). The log files will be created under root C: drive.

After the issue has been reproduced a few times, from the EPP Support Tool please select Export Files and after that Create Achieve(Scroll down menu where Create Log File is) and Execute. This will copy the log files to the location where the Support Tool was installed/run and archive them.
 
This is how the archive should look like:

 
And here are the files it should contain(without the eppsslsplit file):


Please send us these logs and the dump files from one of the affected computers and we will investigate the issue with our devs.

Can you please uninstall it and after that we can schedule a remote session and try to install the client again and see how it reacts.

If the issue occurs again maybe we can recover the dump files so we can pass them over to our devs so they can further investigate this issue.

We can also try deploying another EPP client version to see if the issue occurs with another version as well, or only with that specific client version.
