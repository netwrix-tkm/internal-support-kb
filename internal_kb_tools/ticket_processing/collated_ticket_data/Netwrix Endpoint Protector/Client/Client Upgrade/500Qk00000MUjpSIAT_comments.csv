@WaitingOnEngineer

Does the issue reproduce on a single machine? (the mentioned Windows Server?) We are aware of a similar issue, but theoretically that one will be on Windows 8 or 7 machines. Windows Server 2016 is more similar to Windows 10, so we are not really expecting the issue. Anyway, we can confirm if it is the same issue or not by checking with an older EPP clietn build. Please send the customer first a build from 5940 (I think it is 6.2.3.1009) and see if that one is working. We can also do some more checks on the 5941 build. For that we will need the certificate from ""C:Windowssystem32configsystemprofileAppDataLocalCoSoSysEPP"". When you collect the certificate, collect options.ini as well. And make sure the info related to certificate from options.ini corresponds with your certificate, more exactly:

ws_certpass=xxxx
ws_certpath=C:.....


You can find the above in the file and you need to make sure that the full file path in options.ini that you collected is the same with the path of the actual certificate you collected. If you need more clarifications on this one, you can contact me on Teams and I will explain. The reason behind all this is the fact that the EPP client tries over and over to get a new certificate (with a certain pause/delay between the attempts) and I just want to make sure that the info, more exactly the password of the certificate you collect is the one stored in options.ini. It can happen that you collect let's say first options.ini and by the time you collect the certificate, it is already a new one, not the one mentioned in options.ini.

There one more thing the customer can try. If possible, install any Windows updates that are available for the machine. And test with the 5941 build

The issue is only happening on this device, the others work correctly.

We tried with the 5940 build, 6.2.3.1010, and that worked.

Regarding the certificate, I wasn't able to open it, but I opened the options.ini file and the ws_certpath is different:
ws_certpath=C:Windowssystem32configsystemprofileAppDataLocalCoSoSysEPPcertificate.1F8EDF54.1F0037.pem
and the certificate name is: certificate.1FA0EDC1.DED956D.pem

I attached them both to the ticket.

Thanks,

Please check comments in Salesforce case 00437103. The same answer applies here as well. The customer needs to upgrade Windows in order to use builds from patch 5941  and up.

Please find the feedback provided by the customer below:
Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly.
Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027.
Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the “Client Installer” page 2016 is shown as being supported (on the client download page).

Thanks,

@Krzysztof Staszalek

What should be the official answer for the customer? Windows server 2016 is based on an old Win10 version and it has the same issue like old Win versions. I found this online: ""Mainstream support for Windows Server 2016 ended on January 11, 2022, and extended support will end on January 12, 2027"".

We could tell the customer that we support Win Server 2016 as well, but only with older client builds.

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer 

As part of Netwrix's strategy and commitment to providing solutions with the highest security standards, we have updated the cryptography components in EPP Clients with the 5.9.4.1 release. As a result, support for Windows XP, 7, 8, early builds of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 has been discontinued. Initially, this was not planned, but due to the lack of standard support and fixes from Microsoft for these operating systems and cryptography engines, we cannot offer new EPP Clients for them. To maintain EPP coverage on these systems, customers should continue using EPP Client version 5.9.4.0. Please note that no new features or fixes will be backported to this release. This known limitation will be detailed in the upcoming Release Notes.
