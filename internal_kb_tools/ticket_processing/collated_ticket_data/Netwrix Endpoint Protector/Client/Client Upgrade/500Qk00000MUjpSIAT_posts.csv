I have updated some of our clients today to version 6.2.4.2000 and one of them is now not reporting correctly. It started off with the machine not showing that the new version of the client was installed so i removed the agent and reinstalled it but this didn't help. I have tried completely removing the agent and delete the computer from the server console but nothing is working with it. Please could you advise what i can do to find out what is causing this behaviour.

Kind Regards,
Andrew","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-03T14:14:11.000Z"
