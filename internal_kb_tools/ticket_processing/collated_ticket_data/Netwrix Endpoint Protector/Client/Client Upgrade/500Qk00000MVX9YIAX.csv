As agreed by phone, please help me solve the problem that occurs when updating the agent from version 6.2.3.1 to 6.2.4.2. After the update, the agent stops communicating with the server, which results in the station going offline.

From our observations, the problem only affects devices running on Windows 8.1. When you restore an older version of the agent (6.2.3.1), communication is restored. On Windows 10 and 11, the agent works fine after the update.

Please inform me about the further proceedings in this case.","","- Connected with the customer for a troubleshooting session, and reproduced the scenario for Windows 8.1.
- the issue is reproducible not only for UI client Upgrades, but also if the 6.2.4.2 client is installed manually on the mentioned computer","- create a R&D ticket for visibility to the Product team","Netwrix EPP agent supports all CURRENT versions of Windows clients and Servers as listed on the Microsoft chart below that have not reached ""end of service"" with Microsoft.

Beginning with October, the last EPP client version that will be supported will be the one that is latest at that time, for Windows 10.
