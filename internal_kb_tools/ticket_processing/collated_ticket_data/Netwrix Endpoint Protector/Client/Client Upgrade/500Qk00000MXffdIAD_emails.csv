Hello Botond,

the question is the following:

For example, what is following me the last days, are thoughts about our Security in the Company, with rising hack tools which can be used to enter Company devices without being detected.

I saw a lot of Videos about Hackers now having new tools like the Flipper, HackyPi USB and so on.

When someone is now sticking their USB devices into a USB Slot, the devices are just being detected as Keyboards, for example then being used as a Keylogger oder enter Code etc. The hackers minds are maybe more open minded when thinking about getting into the systems with more creativity.

How is our very good tool Endpoint Protector be able to stop such attacks or do we have to configure something Special.

Thank you very much !!!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello Botond,

 

the question is the following:

 

For example, what is following me the last days, are thoughts about our Security in the Company, with rising hack tools which can be used to enter Company devices without being detected.

 

I saw a lot of Videos about Hackers now having new tools like the Flipper, HackyPi USB and so on.

 

When someone is now sticking their USB devices into a USB Slot, the devices are just being detected as Keyboards, for example then being used as a Keylogger oder enter Code etc. The hackers minds are maybe more open minded when thinking about getting into the systems with more creativity.

 

How is our very good tool Endpoint Protector be able to stop such attacks or do we have to configure something Special.

 

Thank you very much !!!

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Kind Regards

Hello Botond,

 

the question is the following:

 

For example, what is following me the last days, are thoughts about our Security in the Company, with rising hack tools which can be used to enter Company devices without being detected.

 

I saw a lot of Videos about Hackers now having new tools like the Flipper, HackyPi USB and so on.

 

When someone is now sticking their USB devices into a USB Slot, the devices are just being detected as Keyboards, for example then being used as a Keylogger oder enter Code etc. The hackers minds are maybe more open minded when thinking about getting into the systems with more creativity.

 

How is our very good tool Endpoint Protector be able to stop such attacks or do we have to configure something Special.

 

Thank you very much !!!

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Kind Regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MXffd:ref


Hello Botond,

the question is the following:

For example, what is following me the last days, are thoughts about our Security in the Company, with rising hack tools which can be used to enter Company devices without being detected.

I saw a lot of Videos about Hackers now having new tools like the Flipper, HackyPi USB and so on.

When someone is now sticking their USB devices into a USB Slot, the devices are just being detected as Keyboards, for example then being used as a Keylogger oder enter Code etc. The hackers minds are maybe more open minded when thinking about getting into the systems with more creativity.

How is our very good tool Endpoint Protector be able to stop such attacks or do we have to configure something Special.

Thank you very much !!!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello Botond,

 

the question is the following:

 

For example, what is following me the last days, are thoughts about our Security in the Company, with rising hack tools which can be used to enter Company devices without being detected.

 

I saw a lot of Videos about Hackers now having new tools like the Flipper, HackyPi USB and so on.

 

When someone is now sticking their USB devices into a USB Slot, the devices are just being detected as Keyboards, for example then being used as a Keylogger oder enter Code etc. The hackers minds are maybe more open minded when thinking about getting into the systems with more creativity.

 

How is our very good tool Endpoint Protector be able to stop such attacks or do we have to configure something Special.

 

Thank you very much !!!

 

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Kind Regards
