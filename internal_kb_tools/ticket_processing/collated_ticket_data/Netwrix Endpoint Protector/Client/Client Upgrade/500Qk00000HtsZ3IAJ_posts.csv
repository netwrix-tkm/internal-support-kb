Customer name is PrivatBank.
They shared the feedback regarding Ubuntu 24.04 EPP client:
""We cannot use the same EPP client version for Ubuntu 24.04 and 22.04 because our local repository returns error.""
Currently, EPP client has the same version 2.4.3.1007 for Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04.
Would it be possible to make different build versions for these OS versions in future releases?
Or please give some instruction on how we can manually change the package version.
For example: v2.4.3.2204 and v2.4.3.2404","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-05T09:46:32.000Z"
