"500Qk00000FzwCzIAJ","00421566","Support Ticket","MacOS 15 support","We'd like to begin testing the new version of MacOS but so far EPP is our only agent that has not explicitly announced support for the new OS.  I know on my previous ticket your engineering team said there would be day 1 support but the agent update dashboard still does not show support for 10.15 and I haven't seen any notice from your team either.

Is there an ETA for when this support will be added so that we can begin testing?","","","","Informed customer that the latest version of the agent is compatible with MACOS 15","","Iosif Muntean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","Cleerly","Josh Luttrell","2024-09-19T16:54:30.000Z","2024-09-19T19:45:36.000Z"
