Hello,

I am having the technician respond directly to the ticket.

The ticket was created using our support@openpathproducts.com<mailto:support@openpathproducts.com> account, but I am getting emails directly to my email address. Is there a way to have tickets created from support@openpathproducts.com<mailto:support@openpathproducts.com> to have emails sent to that same email address?

Thanks,
Christopher Ringley

Hello Christopher,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00424690. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00424690
Ticket Subject: Upgrade Froze Many Systems and Failed on Roughly Half
Ticket Details: We recently attempted to upgrade our Windows clients from version 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.3.1. Many systems became entirely unresponsive for multiple minutes during the upgrade, and some had to be rebooted for all programs to resume properly. Additionally, only 28 of the 50 attempted systems were upgraded successfully. One of our team members looked for error logs or an error code on the server and was not able to find anything that would explain why so many systems were unsuccessful.

Thank you!

Eduard Nut

Could you try manually installing the agent on one or two computers to see if it fails?
Also, do you have the option to use an MDM tool for the upgrade process?

To see install logs please append this to the misiexec command: /l*v <path_to_>EPPClientSetup.log and make sure to replace the <path_to_> with the local patch on the computer, usually, other customers point to the Desktop folder to make sure they have write access.
After that send me the file and I can check it out. Of course, you can open it and somewhere at the bottom of the file, you should see the reason it fails.
Also, try manually installing the agent on one computer to see if there are other issues besides the MDM deployment.
Please let me know your timezone and availability if you need assistance, and I will set it up.

What I see in the logs is that msiexec cannot find the installer or the path to it. It appears it is looking in C:Program Files (x86)ManageEngineUEMS_Agentswrepository1swuploadssw41104EPPClientSetup.6.3.1010_x86_64.msi
Can you confirm that the deployment tool also copies the setup in that path locally on the computer where it installs?
