Thank you for your email.
I understand the scenario- and to answer both questions-No, the clients will not be affected by the server upgrade, as they will continue to communicate with the server even during the update.
As for upgrading the clients, this can be done form the console directly, as seen below, for Windows.
As for RHEL, the client is already running on the latest version- 2.1.0.6 and degradation is not needed/possible.

Hi Adrian,

Good day!
Thanks for the update :) Appreciate it!
Our main concern would be will the clients currently available on 5.8.0.0 for the Windows, be able to communicate with the server on 5.9.2.0 ?

If that is possible, then we will aim to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.2.0 then proceed to create an upgrade job for all the Windows computers.

If it is not possible, then we seek your advice on the upgrade path.

Thank you!

Thank you for your email.
This is not a migration no? If the server remains the same, it does not matter to what server version you are upgrading,
or what version will the server/clients be on, yes they will be able to communicate with the server without a problem.

Hi Adrian,

Good day!
This is not a migration, merely a firmware upgrade.
The server remains the same.
Noted on your response, we will proceed with the activity then.

We have no further questions on this topic, you can proceed to close this ticket.

Thank you!
