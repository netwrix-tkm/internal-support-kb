Could you please tell me why the server version and the agent version are different for a PrivatBank customer? The customer has a server version of 5.9.4.1, but they have not yet updated the server due to the transition to a new one but in their EPP server version they have available EPP client version 6.2.4.2000
Our CoreWin server version is 5.9.4.2 and the agent version is 6.2.4.1006
Have you had such cases?

Please find attached screenshots.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-06T14:13:25.000Z"

- Customers who upgraded their servers immediately after release received this initial client version.
- Subsequent patches or updates to the 5.9.4.1 server package included newer client versions (such as 6.2.4.2000).
- It is possible for the EPP server to offer a newer client version than the one originally released with the server, depending on when the server was updated or patched.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-07T07:34:02.000Z"

2. Ensure that both server and client are updated according to your organizationâ€™s maintenance schedule and best practices.
3. If there are concerns about compatibility or upgrade paths, consult with Netwrix Support before deploying new client versions in production.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-07T07:35:27.000Z"
