The last Client Upgrade was on 13.12.24, 3 of 6 Clients did the Upgrade successful. Two days ago i tried the rollout to all other clients. But the successfully rate keeps stuck at 0 devices. 

Policy transfer to the clients works fine i believe. In the time between december 24 until now, I chanced the server to a higher ubunto version and we uninstalled the ""XZ Utils"" component because of the CVE.","","16.04
- the customer is having issues with client upgrades from the console
- asked them to delete the old jobs and try again. I also let them know they can download a report of the upgrade jobs if they need it
- if the jobs fail again, we will schedule a RS to look into the issue

- the customer replied they're still facing the issue even after deleting the old jobs
- asked for availability for a remote session

During the RS we did the following
- checked if the client is communicating:  yes
- client installed on virtual machine - windows 11
- old client is 6.2.3.1
- server version: 5.9.4.1
- client recently migrated to a new server, could that be the issue?
- collected logs while the upgrade job was running
- upgraded the client manually
- event viewer doesn’t show any updates regarding the EPP installation
- forced uninstall attempt shows up in the logs - it wasn’t uninstalled
- we received the following error when trying to install it manually: installer cannot be opened because it’s not a valid installer packed
- the installer doesn’t get correctly downloaded, it has 0KBs
- uploaded the offline patch for OTP issue: http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_agent_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U0066-M0001.tar.gz
- client installer could be downloaded afterwards correctly
