"500Qk00000KyWJOIA3","00433309","Support Ticket","Mac Agents Points to unknown server","Hi Team, 

As per the EPP server, we have a total of 139 Mac machines. Before pushing the agent upgrade, we noticed that some machines were pointing to a different server and not to our EPP server.

If it points to a different domain, there won't be communication with that machine to update, and we are concerned about the security. 

Andre, from your team, is aware of this as we discussed this on a different call.

Refer to the attached screenshots and please revert asap.

Thanks!","","","","closing this as a duplicate of 00435996","","Botond Biro","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","29.1","Closed - Resolved","Avrioc Technologies","Naveen Kumar","2025-01-23T12:44:22.000Z","2025-02-21T13:57:10.000Z"
