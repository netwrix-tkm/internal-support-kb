Hello,


We have uninstalled the client from all the endpoints(except around 250 which are not seen by the console, and we have already opened a ticket for that), and we will deploy via Intune the last client version.
Please let the ticket open to see on the next client upgrade job if the issue was resolved or not. But I bet it isn't.


Thanks,
Cristian

If you will install the latest client version - the one from 5941 and then wait for the next release until you could perform a client upgrade (as only a new server release will contain a new version of clients) this means that this Support ticket needs to remain open for 1-2 months until the next release.
Unfortunately this is not possible currently due to Netwrix policy of not keeping tickets open for such a long time for situations when the customers need to test a fix in their environment.

But I want to help you, as always did and would like to propose you to close this ticket - with your approval of course. And once the new patch is available with a new set of clients I will personally connect along with you and try the client upgrade.
Please also find below my direct tel no.  0756293746 - on which you can call me directly in case you face any issue in this sense - I will also help with a new ticket raise for this topic at that time!

Looking forward for your confirmation.
