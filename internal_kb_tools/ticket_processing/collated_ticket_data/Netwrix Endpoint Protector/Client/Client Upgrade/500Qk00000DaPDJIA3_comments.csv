The issue is probably related to some missing certificates in the Certificate Store. Please check these two Jira issues:

https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-194
https://jira-epp.endpointprotector.com/browse/EPPSUPPORT-586

You can find there details related to some Global Sign and DigiCert certificates that are needed so that the EppNotifier has the signature recognized. Side note, not only the EppNotifier fails the signature check, all the other DLLs and EXEs that are installed are failing the signature check (so the customer should have a lot of integrity fail events)

In the Jira threads you will find info about the certificates that need to be installed (if not present in the Windows Certificate Store, you can check there presence like in the printscreen below)
