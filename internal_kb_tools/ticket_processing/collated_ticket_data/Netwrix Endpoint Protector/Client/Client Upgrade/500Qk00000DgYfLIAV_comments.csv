The upgrade will only work from version 5.9.4.1 to newer versions.

However, until then, if our customer still wants to give a try to upgrades, they can add the name 'msiexec' (without the quotes) to the list in the ""System Parameters"" / ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"". Or they can disable the ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning"" feature and try to do the upgrade again.

The latest logs show that indeed they did what we instructed them to do to enable the upgrades.

However, there is no upgrade command in the logs, in fact they are using the expected EPP agent version from the 5.9.4 product update (6.2.3.1010).

The last upgrade command received from the EPP agent was on August 14th 2024. After that date there are several EPP Agent uninstall commands issued by the EPP server on August-26 and on October-17.

The EPP agent is the latest version. So what is the problem here? @WaitingOnEngineer

In the latest eppclient.log we can only see that an upgrade process was started but the EPP service was not stopped as a result. This means that the upgrade failed at some point. In order for us to determine why it has failed we would need the upgrade log file that can be found here:

""C:WindowsTEMPepp-upgrade.log""

If there is no file there, then maybe they can take a look in the Windows Event Viewer to check if there are any Windows Installer errors. @WaitingOnEngineer

What about the ""C:WindowsTEMPSIEA9A3.tmp"" file? Does it still exists on the PC, what is its size? We believe that file is not a valid MSI installer.

If they access this link from a browser:

https://dlp.prodia.co.id/csup/software-win-6.2.3.1010/EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi

does the browser download a valid MSI installer? If not, then we should have someone from the server team take a look. FYI @WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Daniel,
I hope you are well.

Based on a discussion with Robert, could you please ask the customer to download the temporary file from the server? It might have been a one-off event.

In case the issue still occurs, please collect new logs so that dev can further investigate.
