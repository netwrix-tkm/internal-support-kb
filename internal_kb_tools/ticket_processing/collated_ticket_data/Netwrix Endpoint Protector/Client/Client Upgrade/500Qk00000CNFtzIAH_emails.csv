The new EPP Agent was not included in the patch, so you will not see it under System Configuration -> Client software / Client Software update.
Currently I can only provide the download links for the  new agents.
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
You can push the new agents to the machines using an MDM tool.

I asked internally if we will have the possibility to add the new EPP Agents in the EPP Server so you can push the latest agents to all the machines from System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade.
Once I will get some more details regarding this possibility, I will get back to you with an update.

Hello,

I am following up to find out if you were able to determine if the 3.0.2.2005 MacOS EPP Agent is planned, and when, to be added to the EPP Server for remote client software upgrades?

Alternatively, is there any update command that can be run locally from the endpoint to force it to check in for an update to the 3.0.2.2005 instead of the 3.0.2.1 version available on the server? Otherwise, can the 3.0.2.2005 updated package you provided be installed on top of an existing endpoint installation to update it, or does the existing endpoint agent first need to be uninstalled?

Thanks,

Hello Nicholas,

Yes, the MacOS Agents are affected as well.
Let me know if we can schedule a remote session in order to apply the patch which fixes the vulnerability on the EPP Server.
Also I will give you a download link for the latest EPP Agents for both Windows and MacOS which are addressing this vulnerability.

Best regards,
Emil

I don't have yet an update regarding when the new EPP Clients will be added to the EPP Server.
I will definitely have an update regarding this matter during the next week.

If you want to update the EPP Clients on MacOS, the new EPP Client for MacOS can be installed on top of the old EPP Client and it will update it to the newer version.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello,

 

I am following up to find out if you were able to determine if the 3.0.2.2005 MacOS EPP Agent is planned, and when, to be added to the EPP Server for remote client software upgrades?

 

Alternatively, is there any update command that can be run locally from the endpoint to force it to check in for an update to the 3.0.2.2005 instead of the 3.0.2.1 version available on the server? Otherwise, can the 3.0.2.2005 updated package you provided be installed on top of an existing endpoint installation to update it, or does the existing endpoint agent first need to be uninstalled?

 

Thanks,

Nicholas Micallef, CISSP, C|EH

Hello Nicholas,

The new EPP Agent was not included in the patch, so you will not see it under System Configuration -> Client software / Client Software update.
Currently I can only provide the download links for the  new agents.
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip
You can push the new agents to the machines using an MDM tool.

I asked internally if we will have the possibility to add the new EPP Agents in the EPP Server so you can push the latest agents to all the machines from System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade.
Once I will get some more details regarding this possibility, I will get back to you with an update.

Best regards,
Emil

Is that 3.0.2.2005 MacOS Endpoint Protector agent version expected to be released to be deployed as a software update via the EPP Server?



 

I only see 3.0.2.1 available.

Please tell me which version of the MacOS Endpoint protector agent patches the identified vulnerabilities and provide a download link for the patched MacOS agent.

 

We’ve already addressed Windows agents and applied the hotfix to our server.
