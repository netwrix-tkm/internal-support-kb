 It corrupted several hard drives and rendered devices unusable.

Upon investigation, it seems that if the previous installation media is not cached in the Windows installer directory, the uninstall of the previous version fails and the installation of the new client corrupts the device.

We have devices where the filesystem on the C: drive was changed to RAW format and even the Windows Recovery Environment was corrupted, blocking the ability to perform a device reset to factory image or remote wipe via Microsoft Intune.

Please look into this issue.","","The server was updated and they pushed the new client update to the machines","Most of their windows machines are up to date an the issue was not reproduced.","Solved using the agent from 5941","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","210.1","Closed - Resolved","ServiceNow","Swaroop Tiyyagura","2024-08-21T18:07:15.000Z","2025-03-19T20:05:05.000Z"
