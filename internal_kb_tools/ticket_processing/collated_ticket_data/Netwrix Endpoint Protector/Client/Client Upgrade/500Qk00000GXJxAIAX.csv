"500Qk00000GXJxAIAX","00422667","Support Ticket","Computer Restart Required after upgrading the agent or enabling/disabling DPI","Hello Support Team,

In the Netwrix Endpoint Protector v5.9.4 documentation, I realized a new caution statement added which was not in the v5.9.3 user manual:

""CAUTION: To ensure consistent DPI behavior after enabling or disabling the feature or upgrading the Endpoint Protector, a restart of your computer is required.""

Could you elaborate this, how much is it a hard requirement, what functionality does not work until computer restart?","","The customer asked if the reboot of the computers is mandatory after the client update.","Because of the Network extension, the reboot is mandatory. But after the agent from 5.9.4.1 will be installed the reboot should not be mandatory anymore.
The customers will update the server to 5.9.4.1 and test this.","The customer's question was answered.","","Emil Podar","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","125.0","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Serhat Demir","2024-10-02T12:06:14.000Z","2025-02-04T13:00:08.000Z"
