"500Qk00000FYS2rIAH","00420488","Support Ticket","Clients not selectable during client software upgrade","Since the server upgrade to 5.9.4.0, I am no longer able to upgrade most of the clients to the 6.2.3.1 version. They are grayed out as if they were offline, which they are not. For a few it worked, but for about 90% I do not have the possibility. What is the reason for this? The clients are still licensed and online and the server synchronization under “Last seen” also takes place without any problems.","","","","Solution provided to customer, delete old upgrade jobs.
