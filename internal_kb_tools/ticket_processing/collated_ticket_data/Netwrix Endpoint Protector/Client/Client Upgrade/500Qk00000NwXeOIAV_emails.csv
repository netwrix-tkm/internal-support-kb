Thank you for contacting us.

To reply to your question, you can upgrade only the Windows from the EPP server by using the System Configuration ->Client software upgrade.

For the Linux part, I will get this internally and get back to you with an answer and the packeges.

I am following up in regards of your inquiries.

To respond to your question related to the deployment on Linux machines, this could be done through a third party tool as currently we do not support upgrades for Linux through our system(only for MAC and Windows).


I am attaching below the patches for the required Ubuntu packages:
 

	
		
			Ubuntu 20.04
			https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_20.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz
		
		
			Ubuntu 22.04
			https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_22.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz
		
		
			Ubuntu 24.04
			https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_24.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz
		
	

 


	
		
			Ubuntu 23.04
			http://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EppClient_v2.4.2.1006/EPPClient_ubuntu_23.04_v2.4.2.1006_x86_64.tar.gz
		
	



Also, for Ubuntu 12 and 21, could you please let me know the exact version?

I need to double check for those to see if we support them.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for getting back to us.

We recommend to use a 3rd party solution tool for mass deployment. 

That way you ensure each device will get the needed upgrade accordingly in a more automated manner.

Let me know if you have further questions.

To respond to your inquiry, mass deployment needs to be done through a 3rd party tool or at a GPO level.

The needed deployment tool is chosen by each organization depending on their needs and company policy, therefore it is up to each customer to choose their needed tools.

For Windows/MAC OS upgrades, you can use our portal directly from the Client Software Upgrade to upgrade in bulk Windows or MAC OS devices:



For Linux devices, we recommend to use a 3rd party deployment tool.

Again, the chosen deployment tool depends on the company needs, policies and security thus why we do not have any recommendation in regards of this.

We do not have a specific 3rd party application as this depends on each client what they prefer to use, but from a simple search I have found some that could help you start with your search.

And these are just a few.

Hello Anil,

To respond to your inquiries:

Does the upgrade jobs for windows/Mac Clients requires user interaction to
update the client version ?

No need for user interaction, you can perform the action directly from the
portal.

Does 3rd party deployment tool for Linux clients require user interaction?

We do not have an answer for this question as it is out of our scope.

Could you please tell some examples for 3rd party deployment tool for Linux
devices?

We do not have a specific 3rd party application as this depends on each
client what they prefer to use, but from a simple search I have found some
that could help you start with your search.

*Chef*
*SaltStack*

*AnsiblePuppet*

And these are just a few.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for following up on this issue.

In such case, we recommend to seek out a 3rd party tool that also has these sort of capabilities otherwise, the uninstallation process might be required manually.

If the device does not communicate at least with the server it is impossible to perform any bulk actions from the server side, therefore a 3rd party tool is required.

Hello Anil,

Thank you for following up.

Not sure I understand the query.

Are you referring on how to uninstall the EPP client from devices that are offline and unlicensed or how to delete the offline&unlicensed devices from the EPP server?

Looking forward to your response.

Hi Marian,

We have deleted the computers, which are no longer required to be covered, So deleting them deleting them removes from license group as well or do we need to release license separately ?

I need your support on this tomorrow over zoom call preferably between 12 PM - 1:30 PM IST or 3 PM to 4:30 PM IST

Requesting you to block the calendar accordingly as it is urgently required.

My colleague Marian is Out of office, but I will be happy to reply to your question. 
Yes, by deleting the computers from the Device Control > Computers menu the licenses will also be revoked and become available.
If you require a remote session I am available right now -for the following 1 hour.

The computers are added again only if the client is still installed on the endpoint and it is communicating with the server.
As long as the client will still be installed and communicating with the server despite the fact that you are deleting the entry of the computer from Device Control > Computers, it will be re-added in the list.

In order to resolve this, you need to make sure that the client is uninstalled from the endpoint computer not only deleted from the Computer list.
Please let me know if this helps by testing it on a computer.

For Windows and Mac OS the command to uninstall the client can be sent also from the Server - Server Configuration > Client uninstall menu.
For Linux, it has to be done manually or through a third party deployment app where to use the uninstall script present in the client package.
