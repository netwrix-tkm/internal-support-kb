I asked them to try with 2 different scenarios with 2 versions of the client just to see if the error code is the same in the eppclient.log file and it seems that the error codes are different.
The 1st scenario was: when you upgrade the existing old client to version 5928 - this would represent an intermediary version so that we can see if the error is the same as for the latest versions.
The 2nd scenario was: when you upgrade the “6.2.1.2” on a system and then sent an upgrade to version “6.2.2.1”","","","","005Qk000001nViDIAU","2024-10-25T07:30:54.000Z"
