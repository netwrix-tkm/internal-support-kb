Hi Botond,

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Kind Regards,
Andrew

Hi Andrew,

Could you please let me know what version of Windows Server are you using?
Do you have other Windows Servers with the same configuration on which the EPP client is installed and works?

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your time today!
Please allow us some time until we can figure out what might be causing the communication error between the server and the client.
I will keep you updated on the progress.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Hi Andrew,

Could you please let me know what version of Windows Server are you using?
Do you have other Windows Servers with the same configuration on which the EPP client is installed and works?

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Do you have other Windows Servers with the same configuration on which the EPP client is installed and works?

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Kind Regards,
Andrew

Hi Andrew,

Could you please let me know what version of Windows Server are you using?
Do you have other Windows Servers with the same configuration on which the EPP client is installed and works?

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your time today!
Please allow us some time until we can figure out what might be causing the communication error between the server and the client.
I will keep you updated on the progress.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your time today!
Please allow us some time until we can figure out what might be causing the communication error between the server and the client.
I will keep you updated on the progress.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Thank you for your patience!
I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

Hi Botond,

 

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

Apologies for the delay in replying to you on this.

Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly. Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027.

Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the ""Client Installer"" page 2016 is shown as being supported.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your patience!
I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

Please allow us some time until we can figure out what might be causing the communication error between the server and the client.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

 

Apologies for the delay in replying to you on this.

 

Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly. Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027. 

 

Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the “Client Installer” page 2016 is shown as being supported.

 



 

Kind Regards,

Andrew

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your patience!
I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

I received the following feedback from the product team:

As part of Netwrix's strategy and commitment to providing solutions with the highest security standards, we have updated the cryptography components in EPP Clients with the 5.9.4.1 release. As a result, support for Windows XP, 7, 8, early builds of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 has been discontinued. Initially, this was not planned, but due to the lack of standard support and fixes from Microsoft for these operating systems and cryptography engines, we cannot offer new EPP Clients for them. To maintain EPP coverage on these systems, customers should continue using EPP Client version 5.9.4.0. Please note that no new features or fixes will be backported to this release. This known limitation will be detailed in the upcoming Release Notes.

Hi Botond,

 

Apologies for the delay in replying to you on this.

 

Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly. Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027. 

 

Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the “Client Installer” page 2016 is shown as being supported.

 



 

Kind Regards,

Andrew

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your patience!
I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

Apologies for the delay in replying to you on this.

Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly. Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027.

Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the ""Client Installer"" page 2016 is shown as being supported.

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for your patience!
I received the following feedback from the R&D team:
Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Botond,

 

Many thanks for the update on this. I will use this information as part of my business case for upgrading the server operating system. In the meantime we will continue using the version of the agent which is currently installed.

 

I really appreciate all your time and efforts on this, please feel free to go ahead and close the ticket.

Hi Andrew,

I received the following feedback from the product team:

As part of Netwrix's strategy and commitment to providing solutions with the highest security standards, we have updated the cryptography components in EPP Clients with the 5.9.4.1 release. As a result, support for Windows XP, 7, 8, early builds of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 has been discontinued. Initially, this was not planned, but due to the lack of standard support and fixes from Microsoft for these operating systems and cryptography engines, we cannot offer new EPP Clients for them. To maintain EPP coverage on these systems, customers should continue using EPP Client version 5.9.4.0. Please note that no new features or fixes will be backported to this release. This known limitation will be detailed in the upcoming Release Notes.

Hi Botond,

 

Apologies for the delay in replying to you on this.

 

Many thanks for the update. We can investigate the possibility of updating the server but as this would require a new Windows Server licence it is not something we are going to be able to do quickly. Also from a Microsoft perspective this is still a supported version of Windows that is still receiving updates with an end of life date of  12th January 2027. 

 

Does this mean is it Netwrix / CoSoSys that has ended support for Windows Server 2016? If so can the product documentation be updated to reflect this as on the “Client Installer” page 2016 is shown as being supported.

 



 

Kind Regards,

Andrew

Since the customer uses and old version of Windows, they customer need to upgrade it in order to use builds from patch 5.9.4.1 and up. This version of Windows is missing some patches, which cause incompatibilities with the latest client version.

Hi Botond,

 

Sorry for the delay in my reply. The server in question runs Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately, this is the only Server 2016 machine we have that has EPP installed.

Hi Andrew,

Could you please let me know what version of Windows Server are you using?
Do you have other Windows Servers with the same configuration on which the EPP client is installed and works?

Hi Andrew,

Please find the download link to the ZAP tool below:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip

You will need to run it as an administrator and reboot the system after it finishes. If the client is still present after the reboot, repeat the procedure once more.

Hi Andrew,

Before we can send over the uninstallation tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.
