"00aQk000009TlpZIAS","500Qk00000EkkflIAB","Hello,
I asked again for a meeting in order to try to install the new EPP Client. 
The customers refused to do this last time when I asked, because when the disk gets corrupted there are no logs that we can collect from the machine. 
A workaround which was presented to the customer was to use the ZAP tool prior to the EPP Client installation. This way we can completely remove the old EPP Client so the issue will not be reproduced when the new client is installed.
Also this issue only happened to one machine on their environment. They have some test machines where the agent was installed with no issues.
I will try to remotely connect again with the customer in order to install the new agent and see what will happen.","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2024-10-04T12:38:05.000Z","2024-10-04T12:38:05.000Z","false","false"

Epp-client should not cause the above mentioned issues. This is the first time we hear about such problems.

""if the previous installation media is not cached in the Windows 
installer directory, the uninstall of the previous version fails"" - unfortunately this is how Windows works, we can not control this. If this is a prerequisite to reproduce the issue, then there is nothing we can do about it.
