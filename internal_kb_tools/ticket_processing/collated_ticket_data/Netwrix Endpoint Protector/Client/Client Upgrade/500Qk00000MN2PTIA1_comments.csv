@WaitingOnEngineer

I've investigated a similar scenario, I was not able to reproduce it. Please checked the linked ADO entry. Now the issue is investigated by the server side colleagues (cc: @Alexandra-Alina Pascalau)  Marian, maybe you can help Alina in reproducing the scenario.

I've double checked with Andreas regarding the way he performed the manual installation and it seems like he did it by using the below command:

msiexec.exe /i pathtotheeppclientmsi/EPPClientSetup.5.8.0.1_x86_64.msi /qn

We cannot test it this way as we do not have admin rights on the Windows machines where we usually perform the tests.","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-19T07:41:57.000Z","2025-03-19T07:41:57.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer

We have a fix for the issue, test build available here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_03_21EppClient_v6.2.4.0111

This can tested by installing any older version (from patch 5940 for example, I think it was 6.2.3.1xxx) and upgrade it to the test build provided. Of course, prior to the upgrade, the department should be changed from defdep to a custom one. The upgrade can be made using the GUI installer or using command line.
