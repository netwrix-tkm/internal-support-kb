During the tests of the latest EPP version we faced with issue when during the EPP client upgrade process all ran program freeze with Windows notification ""Not responding"".
And the only way is to restart all programs or restart PC.
It happens if you upgrade EPP client first time from an old version to the 6.2.3.1.
From our experience, it recreated on two PC, when the client was updating first time, but if try to recreate the scenario on the same machine issue does not repeat.
EPP client were upgrading via EPP console.
Could you please check if you managed to recreate this behavior?","","","","The cust confirmed closure","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","35.0","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-08-05T07:23:05.000Z","2024-09-09T06:49:18.000Z"
