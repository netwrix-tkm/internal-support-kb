"500Qk00000DDVsvIAH","00415327","Support Ticket","Install Switches for Client Version 6.2.2.2005","I was corresponding with Flaviu Moldovan in Ticket #00414808, but would like to continue on this new ticket because Ticket #00414808 was opened by my colleague (who is OOO). 

I am trying to install the newest client (version 6.2.2.2005) and would like to use the following switches:

NO ADDINS:   EPPClientSetup.6.2.2.2005_x86_64_[a=10.10.3.248,d=FIRMDefault,o=0,n=0].msi
OUTLOOK ADDIN:  EPPClientSetup_SSB.6.2.2.2005_x86_64_[a=10.10.3.248,d=FIRMDefault,n=0].msi   

I downloaded <a href='https://EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip' target='_blank'>EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip</a> and unzipped the file. I see <a href='https://EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi' target='_blank'>EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi</a>, which is what I want to use for x64 endpoints. However, I cannot use the a, d, o, and n switches when I try to install <a href='https://EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi' target='_blank'>EPPClientSetup_x86_64.msi</a>. 

I also tried changing the name of the msi file to EPPClientSetup.6.2.2.2005_x86_64, but I could not install the client software.

Can you please advise how I can specify the EPP server, default policy, and add-ons using the msi file for version 6.2.2.2005?
