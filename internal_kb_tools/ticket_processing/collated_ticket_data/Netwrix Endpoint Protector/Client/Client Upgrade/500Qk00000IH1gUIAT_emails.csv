We hope you are doing well.

Upgrading the EPP server from 5.9.3.0 to 5.9.4.0 will bring no visible changes to the end users. The functionalities and policies that are currently in place will also remain.

Upgrading the EPP clients from the current version that you have to the latest will however bring an update to the EPP client icon logo which is present in the tray(Windows) or in the top bar(macOS). It will change from the ""stoplight"" to the Netwrix logo.

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.
