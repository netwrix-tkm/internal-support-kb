Thank you for contacting us.

Could you please take a look under System Configuration->System licensing and see if all of the 190 seats are being occupied? 

More specifically, take a look at the Used column from there:



Also, please note that the while you are choosing the Client Software Upgrade you are selecting based on the OS. Perhaps you have a specific no of Ubuntu, as well as Windows or MAC devices. Also, take in consideration that some of the clients that you have might already have the latest version installed, which should lower the no of available endpoints to upgrade.

Looking forward to your response.
