"500Qk00000FtXApIAN","00421306","Support Ticket","New alert when pushing upgrade from EP console; need to suppress alert.","I upgraded our admin console today (9/17/24) to 5.9.4.0.  After I upgraded the console I then pushed the latest Windows version of EP (6.2.3.1010) using the ""Client Software Upgrade"" feature in the admin console.  During the upgrade to my computer a new popup alerted me to an ""End User Agreement""  that prompted me to accept.  Please help me disable the popup as I do not want all 1000+ users to be alarmed during the upgrade and require them to push the ""I accept"" button.","","","","Informed the customer that the EULA only pops-up on the EPP Server and no need to worry about the client upgrade.","","Iosif Muntean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","2.0","Closed - Resolved","Uniphore","Walt McClelland","2024-09-17T19:19:54.000Z","2024-09-19T19:51:47.000Z"
