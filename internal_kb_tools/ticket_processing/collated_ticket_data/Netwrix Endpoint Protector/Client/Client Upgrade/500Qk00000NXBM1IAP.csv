An example of this is searching for the Serial number: HWT4T39WFJ . This populates with one of the entries with username “rhyscote”, although that one should be under a different Serial number. The CSV export shows the same information as what is in the UI with this example. Can you confirm why the information is showing inaccurately?","","","","We upgraded the EPP server to the latest version 5941 and then we upgraded the EPP client to the latest version(it was about 2-3 years of updates behind) and after that the Serial Number got updated and was read correctly.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","3.0","Closed - Resolved","Sauce Labs","Anish Mehta","2025-03-31T19:10:41.000Z","2025-04-03T20:20:12.000Z"
