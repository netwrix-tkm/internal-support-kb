Hello Spencer,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00421363. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00421363
Ticket Subject: Update Job: Client is not updating
Ticket Details: I just updated to EPP 5.9.4.0. I created an Upgrade Job on the EPP server to update my 3.0.2.1 client to 3.0.3.1. My client is not updating. I tried initiating an ""update policies"" from the client agent. The date and time updates on the EPP client for Policy Received but the client has yet to update to 3.0.3.1. I don’t see entries for Policies Received in the Logs Report on the EPP server after initiating an update from the endpoint. I see entries for when I plug in a USB (connected/unblocked/disconnected).

An additional concern is issuing OTP's will not work, even though, the EPP client says policy received when initiating an update from the endpoint.

Thank you!
