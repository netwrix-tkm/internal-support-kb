The endpoints are hung when installing the new EPP Windows (64-bit version) - Version: 6.2.3.1 via Intune. The user needs to do a hard reboot to get the laptop up. This is not the experience we want to share with our end users. Can we connect and work on it ASAP?  We have put the deployment on hold until we fix it. 

Please share a couple of windows to schedule the call.
 
I have raised a support ticket #.
