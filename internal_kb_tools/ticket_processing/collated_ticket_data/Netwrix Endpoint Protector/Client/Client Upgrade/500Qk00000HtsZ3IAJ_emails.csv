Hello,

Customer was referring to the version number, in this case it 2.4.3.1007 for both 22.04 and 24.04.
So, customer already have 2.4.3.1007 in their local repository and because the EPP client for 24.04 Ubuntu has the same version number is causing the issues.

Hello,

We got the explanation from the customer:

""We have 2 different EPP client .deb packages for two OS versions (22, 24), they are building with different library versions and they have different dependencies.
So, these two packages shouldn't be with the same version name.
We have special protection in our repository to prevent different deb packages with the same version because they are different.
And during the OS update this .deb package will not be updated because it has the same version as the previous one.
Depends on the newer OS version, there should be a newer .deb package version, so it can be installed/updated.
In our case, the deb packages are different, the contents are different, and the versions should be different as well.
We are talking about the .deb package version, not the EPP client version in general, from the EPP client's point of view, you can have the same version for different OS, but the build version, i.e. the .deb package version should be different.
Example:

Let's say you have the EPP client version X.Y.Z, for different versions of Ubuntu you can make builds with “~” at the end:
X.Y.Z~22.04 - for Ubuntu 22.04
X.Y.Z~24.04 - for Ubuntu 24.04
From this it is immediately clear which version of the EPP client and for which version of the OS and the .deb package versions are different.

The current version for Ubuntu 22.04 is 2.4.3.1007:
2.4.3 is the version of the EPP client, it is the version displayed in the console
1007 - We understand as a build version, and this build version should be different for different builds, not identical, and also it will be clearer for which OS version this or other package is.""

Moreover, if you have the guide how to change the .deb version for EPP client, please share it, and we would manually change it for the customer.

I hope you are well.
I have received a conclusion on the request you have raised as seen below:

Our EPP Client naming convention is fixed and constant lifetime in product. 
Is common thing, also on our side that different Clients per Operating systems are called as build name. So the same build version might be releases for RHEL 8.10 and 9.4 and as well for Ubuntu 18/20/22/24.
It is also connected to EPP Client upgrade process logic.
Product will not allow also for any custom modification on our libraries (deb packages as well). 
So, unfortunately, this item has been declined and can not be considered/processed for the product roadmap.

Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Have a nice day,

Hello,

I hope you are well.
I have received a conclusion on the request you have raised as seen below:

Our EPP Client naming convention is fixed and constant lifetime in product.
Is common thing, also on our side that different Clients per Operating systems are called as build name. So the same build version might be releases for RHEL 8.10 and 9.4 and as well for Ubuntu 18/20/22/24.
It is also connected to EPP Client upgrade process logic.
Product will not allow also for any custom modification on our libraries (deb packages as well).
So, unfortunately, this item has been declined and can not be considered/processed for the product roadmap.

Please let us know if we can close this ticket now.

Have a nice day,
Best regards,
Alin Anca

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HtsZ3:ref

Hello,

We got the explanation from the customer:

""We have 2 different EPP client .deb packages for two OS versions (22, 24), they are building with different library versions and they have different dependencies.
So, these two packages shouldn't be with the same version name.
We have special protection in our repository to prevent different deb packages with the same version because they are different.
And during the OS update this .deb package will not be updated because it has the same version as the previous one.
Depends on the newer OS version, there should be a newer .deb package version, so it can be installed/updated.
In our case, the deb packages are different, the contents are different, and the versions should be different as well.
We are talking about the .deb package version, not the EPP client version in general, from the EPP client's point of view, you can have the same version for different OS, but the build version, i.e. the .deb package version should be different.
Example:

Let's say you have the EPP client version X.Y.Z, for different versions of Ubuntu you can make builds with “~” at the end:
X.Y.Z~22.04 - for Ubuntu 22.04
X.Y.Z~24.04 - for Ubuntu 24.04
From this it is immediately clear which version of the EPP client and for which version of the OS and the .deb package versions are different.

The current version for Ubuntu 22.04 is 2.4.3.1007:
2.4.3 is the version of the EPP client, it is the version displayed in the console
1007 - We understand as a build version, and this build version should be different for different builds, not identical, and also it will be clearer for which OS version this or other package is.""

Moreover, if you have the guide how to change the .deb version for EPP client, please share it, and we would manually change it for the customer.


Best regards,

Hello,

Customer was referring to the version number, in this case it 2.4.3.1007 for both 22.04 and 24.04.
So, customer already have 2.4.3.1007 in their local repository and because the EPP client for 24.04 Ubuntu has the same version number is causing the issues.
