We want to upgrade EPP client version 6.2.2.2005 via Console, however we are unable to find this version there. It only shows 6.2.2.1. Please help to get this enabled . Also want to know how successful the deployment is when pushed via EPP console.
Last question : when i try to find systems via groups nothing shows up also in Device Control - Computers we see Groups column empty. Pls advise.
Thanks
Manpreet","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-25T12:33:18.000Z"
