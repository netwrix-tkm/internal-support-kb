"500Qk00000HKvDFIA1","00424690","Support Ticket","Upgrade Froze Many Systems and Failed on Roughly Half","We recently attempted to upgrade our Windows clients from version 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.3.1. Many systems became entirely unresponsive for multiple minutes during the upgrade, and some had to be rebooted for all programs to resume properly. Additionally, only 28 of the 50 attempted systems were upgraded successfully. One of our team members looked for error logs or an error code on the server and was not able to find anything that would explain why so many systems were unsuccessful.","","The agent deployment is failing even after whitelisting the location in their firewall. I asked them to append the log creation to the msiexec command to see why it fails and see if it is our issue or something else.","waiting for the install log file to see the reason for the failures.","Resolved with vbs script.","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","59.3","Closed - Resolved","OpenPath Products","Christopher Ringley","2024-10-22T14:31:03.000Z","2024-12-20T21:45:37.000Z"
