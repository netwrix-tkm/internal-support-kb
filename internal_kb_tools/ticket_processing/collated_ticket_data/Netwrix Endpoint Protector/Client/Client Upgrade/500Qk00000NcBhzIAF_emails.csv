For clarification, you are trying to update the EPP agent through the console. When you went to the ""Client Software Upgrade"", you selected the new agent, then you went to select the endpoints to upgrade and in here you selected a few groups. However, you are seeing an issue where groups that were synced from AD are not updating, while groups that were manually made in the console and had users assigned are upgrading fine. Is that correct?

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
