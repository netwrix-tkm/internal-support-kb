Good day!
We have deployed several RHEL 8.7 clients for one of our users since June last year.
Currently, they have some questions regarding the upgrade process for their RHEL devices.

1) When the RHEL is updated on the device, will the EPP client still function?
2) What is the proper procedure to upgrade both the RHEL and EPP client?

Example: 
Customer is currently on RHEL 8.7, with the EPP client 2106 installed. Customer upgrades their RHEL device to RHEL 9.1.
Will this affect the currently existing EPP client? 

Thank you!
