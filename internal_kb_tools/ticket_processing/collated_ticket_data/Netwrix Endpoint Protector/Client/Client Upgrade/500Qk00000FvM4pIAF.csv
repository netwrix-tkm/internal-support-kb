"500Qk00000FvM4pIAF","00421363","Support Ticket","Update Job: Client is not updating","I just updated to EPP 5.9.4.0.  I created an Upgrade Job on the EPP server to update my 3.0.2.1 client to 3.0.3.1.  My client is not updating.  I tried initiating an ""update policies"" from the client agent.  The date and time updates on the EPP client for Policy Received but the client has yet to update to 3.0.3.1.  I donâ€™t see entries for Policies Received in the Logs Report on the EPP server after initiating an update from the endpoint.  I see entries for when I plug in a USB (connected/unblocked/disconnected).  

An additional concern is issuing OTP's will not work, even though, the EPP client says policy received when initiating an update from the endpoint.","","","","Closing per customer's last comment.","","Zachary Roy","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","51.2","Closed - Resolved","Stanford University","Spencer Chinn","2024-09-18T12:38:21.000Z","2024-11-08T18:15:23.000Z"
