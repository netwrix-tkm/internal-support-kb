"500Qk00000LIvJtIAL","00434235","Support Ticket","Cannot perform Agent software upgrade to clients","Hello, 

When trying to do client Agent software upgrade from EPP, it fails to do so on 10 machines out of the 50. 

Can you please assist? 
I can arrange a remote session with the customer if you want to. 


Kind Regards 
Kostas Mousmoulis","","The EPP Server IP address was lost from the EPP client, it is not known how this could have happened unfortunately the logs were not enabled and thus minimizes the ability to investigate the root cause.","The EPPSetServer tool was used to resolve the issue.  The customer will use the tool on the remaining 9 endpoint computers that are affected and then give us a status update afterward.","The customer solved the issue by releasing the licenses from those machines that were not installing the Agent update through EPP, and then the bulk update worked to those machines worked. Then re-imported the licenses for those machines.
The case may be closed.","","Andre Le Roux","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","NONE","","10.2","Closed - Resolved","Patrikios Pavlou","Kostas Mousmoulis","2025-01-31T08:40:26.000Z","2025-02-10T12:18:05.000Z"
