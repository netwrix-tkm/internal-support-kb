As agreed by phone, please help me solve the problem that occurs when updating the agent from version 6.2.3.1 to 6.2.4.2. After the update, the agent stops communicating with the server, which results in the station going offline.

From our observations, the problem only affects devices running on Windows 8.1. When you restore an older version of the agent (6.2.3.1), communication is restored. On Windows 10 and 11, the agent works fine after the update.

Please inform me about the further proceedings in this case.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-03T19:08:08.000Z"
