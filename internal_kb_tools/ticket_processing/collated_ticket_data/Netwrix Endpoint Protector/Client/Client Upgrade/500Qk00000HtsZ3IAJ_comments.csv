@WaitingOnEngineer
Hi Support,

First this item should be registered as FR, not an escalation ticket. Nevertheless item still it will be refused.

Our EPP Client naming convention is fixed and constant lifetime in product. 
Is common thing, also on our side that different Clients per Operating systems are called as build name. So same build version might be releases for RHEL 8.10 and 9.4 and as well for Ubuntu 18/20/22/24.
It is also connected to EPP Client upgrade proces logic.
Product will not allow also for any custom modification on our libraries (deb packages as well). 

Item refused and not will be considered/processed in product roadmap.
