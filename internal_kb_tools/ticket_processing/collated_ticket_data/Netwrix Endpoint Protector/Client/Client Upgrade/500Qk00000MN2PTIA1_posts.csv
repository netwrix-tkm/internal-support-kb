i just received a question from the sales team on behalf of a prospect which is:
TK automotive systems GmbH, amount: EUR 47.000, size: 1000 endpoints

The usecase is:
they estimate that they will have about 10 departments within EPP.
they want to be able to upgrade the agents by using our upgrade feature from the EPP console but make sure that the department of the machines do not change during the upgrade.

I have tested this on my machine several times to make sure and as it stands right now, by upgrading the agent from the EPP console, the agent will revert to defdep after being upgraded.
This is also the case when upgrading manually using the installation package. If the dep code isnt specifically mentioned in the title of the msi, it will revert to defdep.

Please open a bug/enhancement request to hopefully have this addressed.

Regards,

Andreas","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-27T12:58:11.000Z"

Now Andreas tested manually with the command msiexec.exe /i pathtotheeppclientmsi/EPPClientSetup.5.8.0.1_x86_64.msi /qn and also by upgrading from the EPP server and each time, the department reverted to defdep.

The only time it did work was when the department was mentioned in the title of the MSI package

On our side we did the classic installation of the package manually(double click as an admin and then next next next but we did not encountered that).","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-03-19T09:32:32.000Z"
