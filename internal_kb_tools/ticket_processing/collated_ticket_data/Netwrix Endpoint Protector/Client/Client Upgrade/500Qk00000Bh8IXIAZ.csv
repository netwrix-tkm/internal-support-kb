"500Qk00000Bh8IXIAZ","00411578","Support Ticket","[STE-MPA-EPP] Minimum Backward compatibility for EPP Server","Hi Support,

Good day!
We have a planned maintenance for our customer.
The current EPP Server is running on 5.8.0.0.
The user has 2 different OS in the environment
Windows Server 2019, running on client version 5.9.1.7
RHEL 8.7, running on client version 2.1.0.6

The planned maintenance activity will require us to upgrade the version to the n-1 version, which is 5.9.2.0 

By doing so, we want to know if the 
1) RHEL client will be affected ?
2) Windows client will be affected?

The plan will be to schedule an upgrade job for all the 11 windows server devices within the network after the EPP firmware has been upgraded to 5.9.2.0, will that be possible?

Thank you!
