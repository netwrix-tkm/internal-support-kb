@WaitingOnEngineer

As far as I know this is a known limitation, I am not sure if this is documented or not. After upgrading OpenSSL to v3.0.15 client server communication is broken on older Windows versions (7 and 8). Moreover there are a few support cases at this moment related to some issues on Win10 as well. Those are under investigation, we need to figure out if the issue happens on older Win10 versions as well or it is a server side related issu

Hi Alin,

Please communicate to the customer that at the moment this is a known limitation.

In the meantime, we will confirm if it needs to be documented with Product and technical writing team and will let you know once we know more.

Regards,
Cristi

@WaitingOnEngineer
Hi Alin & Support.
As was explained below, due to refreshed OpenSSL library embedded and used in EPP Client we lost support of obsolete & unsupported Windows OS's like Windows XP, 7, 8, outdated Windows 10 versions (not supported by MS) or Windows Server 2016. All above are out of Microsoft support anyway.
This means customers using these Windows versions should continue with EPP Client release 5.9.4.0, knowing that no features will be backported to this EPP Client release.
Further Known Limitation will be documented and mentioned in our User Manuals/Release Notes.

@WaitingOnEngineer 

Just wanted to mention that we are aware of issues with Win7 and Win8. As mentioned in the previous comment also, we have some reports about older Win10 versions as well, but we did not reach to a conclusion yet, if this is the same issue or something else. It looks like it is, but it might be as well a server side issue. We still need some feedback from customers on this (I've asked this in other threads)

The customer has came back with a question regarding this:

There will no longer be support for Windows 8.1
Additionally, will Netwrix products also stop supporting Windows 10 starting in October, once official support for the OS ends?

Hi Alin,

Hopefully soon official support document will be released, but meanwhile:


--- CODE ---
Windows Clients

Netwrix EPP agent supports all CURRENT versions of Windows clients and Servers as listed on the Microsoft chart below that have not reached ""end of service"" with Microsoft:

Clients: Microsoft-us/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client

Servers: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-server-release-info


NOTE: For complete clarity, Netwrix EPP is not supported on Server 2012 R2, Windows 7, Windows XP and so on. The final agent build with ""best effort"" support is 5.9.4.0 and no more builds will be produced after that which support those operating systems.
