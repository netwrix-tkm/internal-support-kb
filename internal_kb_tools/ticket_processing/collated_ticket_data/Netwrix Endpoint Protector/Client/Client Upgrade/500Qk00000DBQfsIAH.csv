Following ADV-2024-002 â€“ Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify, i've received a email asking me if i ve done the update of client.

I'm a bit confused because i thought it was automatic. All computer are runing 6.1.0.6 version for windows, and i m not seeing other version...

Can you confirm everything is fine ?
