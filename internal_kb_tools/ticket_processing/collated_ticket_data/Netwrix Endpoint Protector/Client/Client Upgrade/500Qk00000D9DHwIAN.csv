"500Qk00000D9DHwIAN","00415165","Support Ticket","ADV-2024-002","I am reaching out in regards to the ADV-2024-002 vulnerability that has recently been discovered. I am curious to know if the client version 6.0.1.6 is affected by this vulnerability. Additionally - I updated the EPP server using the live update feature for the EPP Server Hotfix #1.1, and I can see that the update has applied. The only issue is that I still see this security update available underneath the ""available EPP software updates"" section. I'd like to confirm if the update applied to the server.","","","","Assisted the customer with applying the hotfix containing the agents","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Upgrade","","","3.0","Closed - Resolved","MPR Associates Inc.","Chris Rolin","2024-07-16T17:07:45.000Z","2024-07-19T16:13:44.000Z"
