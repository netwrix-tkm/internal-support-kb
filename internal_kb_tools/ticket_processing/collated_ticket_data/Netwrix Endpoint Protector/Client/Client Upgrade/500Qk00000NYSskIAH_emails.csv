Thank you for reaching out to us.
Could you please tell me your availability for this or next week so that we can arrange a remote session to perform a port separation? 
For the remote session you will need to have Putty installed on your computer as I would need to access the server via SSH.
A snapshot from the virtualization environment will be needed prior to our call.

Regarding the port change on the client-side, please check the attached tool, and let us know if you could change it for 2-3 computers by using it.

Best regards,
Alin Anca

Thank you for your time today.
We managed to perform the port separation in the backend and now the clients are communicating over the port 4433.
With the help of the EPPSetServer tool, please change the port for some of the clients and let us know if everything is ok after that.

Have a nice day,
