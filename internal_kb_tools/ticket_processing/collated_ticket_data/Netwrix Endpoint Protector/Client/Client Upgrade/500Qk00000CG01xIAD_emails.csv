Thank you for contacting the Endpoint Protector Support team.

If the customer plans to upgrade from 8.7 to 9.1 with EPP installed then there is a strong possibility that EPP may not work after the upgrade  - this is why we have different builds for 8.x and 9.x
We would recommend to reinstall a compatible version of EPP after the upgrade was performed.  However the latest epp client which we have for RHEL 9.1 version 2105 which is an older version of what they are currently have on RHEL 8.7.  This means they will need to install an older version of epp client should they upgrade the OS from RHEL 8.7 to RHEL 9.1 or the customer would need to make a request for a new epp client to be build for RHEL 9.1.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Good day!
Noted on your reply.
Based on the current customer's setup, they're an airgapped environment.
Which means, they will definitely need to use the FAT client for the RHEL 9.x builds.
Does this mean
1) The dependencies will all need to be removed, and installed with the latest dependencies for RHEL 9.x clients?
2) When they upgrade from RHEL 8.7 to RHEL 8.8 or RHEL 8.9, the existing client will still work, as it's still within the same major release of RHEL OS ?

Seek your assistance / advice on this.

Thank you!

Please see the answers to the below questions.

Does this mean
1) The dependencies will all need to be removed, and installed with the latest dependencies for RHEL 9.x clients? Yes
2) When they upgrade from RHEL 8.7 to RHEL 8.8 or RHEL 8.9, the existing client will still work, as it's still within the same major release of RHEL OS ? It may still work, the only unknown are the dependencies, erring on the side of caution we suspect that it may not work properly.

We do have a FAT build for RHEL 8.9 with the latest EPP agent version 2.4.2.1006.  You can download the EPP FAT agent v2.4.2.1006 here for RHEL 8.9: http://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EppClient_v2.4.2.1006/EPPClient_rhel_8.9_v2.4.2.1006_x86_64_deps.tar.gz
