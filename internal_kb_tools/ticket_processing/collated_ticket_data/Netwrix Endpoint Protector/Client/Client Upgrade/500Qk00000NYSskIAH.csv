"500Qk00000NYSskIAH","00440577","Support Ticket","Change default Port","Dear Sir or Madam,

We would like to change the default port 443 to another. Please provide us with the best way to do so. We run about 900 Clients with the agent on port 443 and already tried it with a registry change which didn't lead to success. We managed to install a new client with a different port, but would consider this not as a solution as we already have about 900 clients running with old port of 443. Looking forward for your help.
