Engineering got back to me and after checking the crash dump, they think that you should contact Fortinet as the BSOD seems to be caused by one of Fortinet's drivers called: ""AV_FortiEDRWinDriver"".
This is a screenshot of the kernel call stack as shown by the ""WinDbg"" application

Please let me know after reaching out to Fortinet if you have an update there.
If you have further questions, please let me know.

Thank you,

Hey Parin,

While I do not yet have a reply from engineering, I want to see if one of the test builds might fix your BSOD.
Can you please download the test agent and install it on a computer where this is reproducing and see if it is fixed?

Hi Eduard,

 

This is our roadblock to move forward with the Windows 11 machine. Due to this issue we can’t onboard anymore machine because this will cause user disruption.

Hey Parin,

I appreciate the confirmation. I have provided the test outcome and also asked for an update.
Have you upgraded to Win 11 on more computers or is this a roadblock for that?

Hey Parin,

No worries I will be looking at it, and I will also forward it to our dev team for further analysis.
In the meantime, Let me send you the latest client, and just install it on one computer where you are getting BSOD to see if the issue stays the same.
You can find it attached or at this WeTransfer link:  https://we.tl/t-VE0jPM9aRJ 
Please let me know how it goes, and if I have any updates from the logs I will let you know.

Hi Parin,

Before anything else, I want to check using our latest agent and see if the BSOD still happens.
Can you upgrade to the latest server version and use the client that comes with it? Please remember to take a snapshot before upgrading.
If not, let me know and I will send the setup to you somehow.

Hi Parin,

Could you please provide the dump generated by the system after the BSOD happens?
There should already be a mini dump located either under %SystemRoot%MEMORY.DMP or %SystemRoot%Minidump
In the interest of time, it might be a good idea to get a complete memory dump following the  Set up page files and Enable memory dump setting
After a reboot of the computer, have the BSOD reproduce and the dump will be generated under %SystemRoot%MEMORY.DMP, make a copy of this file, compress it, and please send it to me.
I will open an internal investigation and I know they will ask for these.
Other information needed are the server and agent versions.

Thank you,

Do you have the option to use a computer without any of the other tools and security apps installed and just have EPP on it to see if it still causes a BSOD?
Or a reverse method trying to uninstall the installed apps one by one to see which one is causing it, as it might also be an app that conflicts with EPP.
We could also set a remote session and try different agent versions, but we will need to have access to a computer that has the BSOD issue.

Thak you,
