"500Qk00000JlrxDIAR","00430521","Support Ticket","Linux clients crashing","Hello,
Our Linux clients, which are on the newest version of EPP-client, are crashing when our users browse to a repo directory on their machine and syncing. When they go to sync, the entire computer kernel panics.

One of our users has reported that running a sync with trace logging works (he thinks throttling it makes a difference) and disabling parallelization also works around the issue. This is just extra information to help our case.

Thanks!
Danny","","Linux client crashing.","27Jan: Asked R&D to provide test client. Fix is planned for 5960.
