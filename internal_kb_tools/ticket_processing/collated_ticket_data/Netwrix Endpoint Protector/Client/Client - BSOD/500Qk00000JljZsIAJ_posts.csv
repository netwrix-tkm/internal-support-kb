Our Linux clients, which are on the newest version of EPP-client, are crashing when our users browse to a repo directory on their machine and syncing. When they go to sync, the entire computer kernel panics. 

One of our users has reported that running a sync with trace logging works (he thinks throttling it makes a difference) and disabling parallelization also works around the issue. This is just extra information to help our case. 

Thanks!
