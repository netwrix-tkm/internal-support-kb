I've analyzed the amp file but I did not reach to a conclusion yet. I think that best would be to send the customer a newer client version that should be tested on the two machines that encounter the issue. You can suggest them the 5940 build, or even the RC candidate for 5941. The last RC for 5941 that was built is here: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_09_23EPPClient_v6.2.4.1000

If the issue still persists, ask the customer to gather a new dmp file and send it to us. By the way, how often does the issue occur? At every Windows boot? If it's not the case, get some client logs also.
