We have recently started upgrading our endpoints to Windows 11 and in our recent Pilot program we noticed to BSOD on windows 11 endpoints after installing DLP agent. We'd try to troubleshoot in different ways but still issue has not been resolved.

Can we please have someone to look into this matter? 

Also please feel free to ask any supporting log files needed to investigate this issue.

Thanks,
