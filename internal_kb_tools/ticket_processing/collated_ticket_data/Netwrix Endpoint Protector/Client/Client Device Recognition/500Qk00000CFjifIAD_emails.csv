Hi
The customer window responsible for this case went on a long vacation, and
the message was answered a little late.
For Windows, they are looking for devices to test.
Regarding Mac, I will report back to you later.

Hi Support

Have a nice day.
Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation
device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external
connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP
Server.
(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the
file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.
If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software,
please help compress them into encrypted files.)
[image: 擷取.JPG]

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to
provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully
activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
*TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0*

Thanks for your help
Jay

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CFjif:ref


Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hi Support

Thank you for your quick reply.

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and
obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on
the Live update screen of the EPP system?

Br,
Jay

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside
world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still
failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and
the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint
Protector Server.""

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

 

Jay

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

 

Br,

Jay

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CFjif:ref


Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CFjif:ref


Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip


Kind regards

I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?

Thanks for the tip! 

 

TSMC is trying to use.

This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.

Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Br,

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

 

Jay

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

 

Br,

Jay

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hi Support

Thanks for your response.
In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have
changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system
not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which
version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order
is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For
example, system abnormality?

Br,
Jay

Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support

 

I used the update file you provided. 

After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?

Thanks for the tip! 

 

TSMC is trying to use.

This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.

Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

 

Br,

Jay

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thanks for your response.

In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For example, system abnormality?

 

Br,

Jay

Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support

 

I used the update file you provided. 

After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?



Jay

Hello,

This happens on older servers.

Thanks for the tip! 

 

TSMC is trying to use.

This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.

Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

 

Jay

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.

The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to
version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

Hello,

Before applying anything did you create the VM snapshot?
If yes please return to that snapshot.

Then, the server being version 5.6.0.0 you need to start with the below patch.
All patches need to be applied in turn as describen in the list I sent. Ex. 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500575650.tar.gz - partitioning

Apply it to the server and leave it for 30 minutes to finish installing.
After you apply a patch it needs time to install.

Then you take the next available one and apply it.
After applying wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to install, and refresh the browser page.
If the patch installed correctly you will see the version change on the UI.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500555700.tar.gz

After confirming the version change you can apply the next patch and repeat the process.

Epp 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500585710.tar.gz

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

I tried updating to 5.9.3.0, no error message appeared, but the version number was not updated either.
The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thanks for your response.

In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For example, system abnormality?

 

Br,

Jay

Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support

 

I used the update file you provided. 

After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?

TSMC is trying to use.

This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.

Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Br,
Jay

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

 

Jay

Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

 

Br,

Jay

Hello,

Can you please confirm the other ticket number for Comport?

1. You can try the patch below.

http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz
Please also confirm the licenses are applied to the server in ""System Configuration > System Licensing"".

2.
Is this a new VM image?

Before applying any update please create a VM snapshot to return to.

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay

Hi Support

Thank you for your replies

I have a few questions I want to clarify. Because TSMC may see the green
words and implement it all the way.
1. If we do not wait 30 minutes when upgrading to version 5.6.0.0, will
subsequent installations fail?
2. If we did not take a snapshot before upgrading to 5.6.0.0, is it
recommended to reinstall the system?
3. Are there any other precautions to take when upgrading from 5.7.1.0 to
5.9.3.0? For example, does the user want to reboot or wait?

Best Regards
Jay

Hello,

1. If the update does not install and you do not see the version change in the UI the subsequent patches will not start installing because they will notice the wrong server version.

2. Instead of reinstalling we could have a remote connection to check what patches have been applied.
Not sure what patch you applied so far.  Can you please let me know?

3. A reboot is not needed but the customer needs to wait after applying a patch.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your replies

I have a few questions I want to clarify. Because TSMC may see the green words and implement it all the way.
1. If we do not wait 30 minutes when upgrading to version 5.6.0.0, will subsequent installations fail?
2. If we did not take a snapshot before upgrading to 5.6.0.0, is it recommended to reinstall the system?
3. Are there any other precautions to take when upgrading from 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0? For example, does the user want to reboot or wait?

 

Best Regards

Jay

Hello,

Before applying anything did you create the VM snapshot?
If yes please return to that snapshot.

Then, the server being version 5.6.0.0 you need to start with the below patch.
All patches need to be applied in turn as describen in the list I sent. Ex. 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500575650.tar.gz - partitioning

Apply it to the server and leave it for 30 minutes to finish installing.
After you apply a patch it needs time to install.

Then you take the next available one and apply it.
After applying wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to install, and refresh the browser page.
If the patch installed correctly you will see the version change on the UI.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500555700.tar.gz

After confirming the version change you can apply the next patch and repeat the process.

Epp 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500585710.tar.gz

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

I tried updating to 5.9.3.0, no error message appeared, but the version number was not updated either.
The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?7?2? ?? ??12:06???



Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thanks for your response.

In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For example, system abnormality?

 

Br,

Jay

 

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?7?1? ?? ??6:39???



Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support

 

I used the update file you provided. 

After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?



Jay

Thanks for the tip! 

 

TSMC is trying to use.

This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.

Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Br,

Hello,

Offline patches do not need an internet connection.
You can also ty the patch below.

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

 

Jay

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?27? ?? ??7:52???



Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

 

Br,

Jay

 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?27? ?? ??4:45???




Hello,

Can you please confirm the other ticket number for Comport?

1. You can try the patch below.

http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz
Please also confirm the licenses are applied to the server in ""System Configuration > System Licensing"".

2.
Is this a new VM image?

Before applying any update please create a VM snapshot to return to.
You will need to wait until the update is finished before applying the next update.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay
 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?25? ?? ??11:45???


Hello,

Can you please let me know the previous tichet this eas for?
To start the logs on Mac you can follow the steps below.
1. cd /var/log
2. sudo touch eppclient.log
3. sudo touch eppsslsplit.log
4. sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
5. sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

Hi Support

The customer's network environment is completely closed to the outside
world, so remote assistance is impossible.
According to my understanding, I will excerpt the conversation as follows.
Is there any problem with this expression?

Your system is still displayed at 5.6.0.0. This may be because the waiting
time for the system update is too short, resulting in the update not being
completed. Please proceed as follows.
1. When upgrading from 5600 to version 5620 or 5650, please wait 30 minutes
after uploading the update and displaying that the upload is complete
before proceeding to the next step.
2. Please wait more than 15 minutes for other updates, because after the
update package is uploaded, it takes time to gradually apply it to the
system.
3. Except for the marked parts, the rest of the revisions should gradually
show revisions 5.6.0.0->5.7.0.0...and so on.

Thanks
Jay

You are correct.
You can try to apply 5.6.0.0->5.7.0.0 to see if the version changes. If not we will need to think of a different solution.

Hi Support

 

The customer's network environment is completely closed to the outside world, so remote assistance is impossible.
According to my understanding, I will excerpt the conversation as follows. Is there any problem with this expression?

Your system is still displayed at 5.6.0.0. This may be because the waiting time for the system update is too short, resulting in the update not being completed. Please proceed as follows.
1. When upgrading from 5600 to version 5620 or 5650, please wait 30 minutes after uploading the update and displaying that the upload is complete before proceeding to the next step.
2. Please wait more than 15 minutes for other updates, because after the update package is uploaded, it takes time to gradually apply it to the system.
3. Except for the marked parts, the rest of the revisions should gradually show revisions 5.6.0.0->5.7.0.0...and so on.

 

Thanks

Jay

Hello,

1. If the update does not install and you do not see the version change in the UI the subsequent patches will not start installing because they will notice the wrong server version.

2. Instead of reinstalling we could have a remote connection to check what patches have been applied.
Not sure what patch you applied so far.  Can you please let me know?

3. A reboot is not needed but the customer needs to wait after applying a patch.

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thank you for your replies

I have a few questions I want to clarify. Because TSMC may see the green words and implement it all the way.
1. If we do not wait 30 minutes when upgrading to version 5.6.0.0, will subsequent installations fail?
2. If we did not take a snapshot before upgrading to 5.6.0.0, is it recommended to reinstall the system?
3. Are there any other precautions to take when upgrading from 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0? For example, does the user want to reboot or wait?

 

Best Regards

Jay

Hello,

Before applying anything did you create the VM snapshot?
If yes please return to that snapshot.

Then, the server being version 5.6.0.0 you need to start with the below patch.
All patches need to be applied in turn as describen in the list I sent. Ex. 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500575650.tar.gz - partitioning

Apply it to the server and leave it for 30 minutes to finish installing.
After you apply a patch it needs time to install.

Then you take the next available one and apply it.
After applying wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to install, and refresh the browser page.
If the patch installed correctly you will see the version change on the UI.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500555700.tar.gz

After confirming the version change you can apply the next patch and repeat the process.

Epp 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500585710.tar.gz

Kind regards

Hi Support

 

I tried updating to 5.9.3.0, no error message appeared, but the version number was not updated either.
The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.


Kind regards

Hi Support

 

Thanks for your response.

In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For example, system abnormality?

 

Br,

Jay

Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support

 

I used the update file you provided. 

After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.

What is the problem?

Hi Support

 

I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?

 

If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?27? ?? ??7:52???



Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.

Thank you for your quick reply.

 

I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?

Hi Support

 

Have a nice day.

Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.

(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.

If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)



 

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

 

Thanks for your help

Jay
 


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?25? ?? ??11:45???

Hi Jay,

As 5600 is a very old version, can you use the 5810 ovf instead to start with and then update to the latest version? It will take less time and not as many patches to apply.

See attached the screenshot.

Hi Support

The customer's network environment is completely closed to the outside world, so remote assistance is impossible.
According to my understanding, I will excerpt the conversation as follows. Is there any problem with this expression?

Your system is still displayed at 5.6.0.0. This may be because the waiting time for the system update is too short, resulting in the update not being completed. Please proceed as follows.
1. When upgrading from 5600 to version 5620 or 5650, please wait 30 minutes after uploading the update and displaying that the upload is complete before proceeding to the next step.
2. Please wait more than 15 minutes for other updates, because after the update package is uploaded, it takes time to gradually apply it to the system.
3. Except for the marked parts, the rest of the revisions should gradually show revisions 5.6.0.0->5.7.0.0...and so on.

Thanks
Jay

Hello,

1. If the update does not install and you do not see the version change in the UI the subsequent patches will not start installing because they will notice the wrong server version.

2. Instead of reinstalling we could have a remote connection to check what patches have been applied.
Not sure what patch you applied so far.  Can you please let me know?

3. A reboot is not needed but the customer needs to wait after applying a patch.

Kind regards

Hi Support

Thank you for your replies

I have a few questions I want to clarify. Because TSMC may see the green words and implement it all the way.
1. If we do not wait 30 minutes when upgrading to version 5.6.0.0, will subsequent installations fail?
2. If we did not take a snapshot before upgrading to 5.6.0.0, is it recommended to reinstall the system?
3. Are there any other precautions to take when upgrading from 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0? For example, does the user want to reboot or wait?

Best Regards
Jay


Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?7?2? ?? ??2:49???
Hello,

Before applying anything did you create the VM snapshot?
If yes please return to that snapshot.

Then, the server being version 5.6.0.0 you need to start with the below patch.
All patches need to be applied in turn as describen in the list I sent. Ex. 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500575650.tar.gz - partitioning

Apply it to the server and leave it for 30 minutes to finish installing.
After you apply a patch it needs time to install.

Then you take the next available one and apply it.
After applying wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to install, and refresh the browser page.
If the patch installed correctly you will see the version change on the UI.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500555700.tar.gz

After confirming the version change you can apply the next patch and repeat the process.

Epp 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500585710.tar.gz

Kind regards

Hi Support

I tried updating to 5.9.3.0, no error message appeared, but the version number was not updated either.
The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

https://youtu.be/pXEePyOm8To

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?7?2? ?? ??12:06???
Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.

http://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz
Please also confirm the licenses are applied to the server in ""System Configuration > System Licensing"".

2.
Is this a new VM image?

Before applying any update please create a VM snapshot to return to.
You will need to wait until the update is finished before applying the next update.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CFjif:ref
Hi Support

Have a nice day.
Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.
(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.
If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)
[cid:ii_19073cfb8f56f0f20b34]

2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0

Thanks for your help
Jay

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com<mailto:techsupport@netwrix.com>> ? 2024?6?25? ?? ??11:45???

They skip the offline upgrade step first?

Hi Alina
 

Can you give me the latest version of Image(5930)

They skip the offline upgrade step first?

 

Best wishes 

Jay

Hi Jay, 

 

As 5600 is a very old version, can you use the 5810 ovf instead to start with and then update to the latest version? It will take less time and not as many patches to apply. 

https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

 

See attached the screenshot. 


 

Best, 


Alina Cuciureanu

Hi Support



 



The customer's network environment is completely closed to the outside world, so remote assistance is impossible.
According to my understanding, I will excerpt the conversation as follows. Is there any problem with this expression?

Your system is still displayed at 5.6.0.0. This may be because the waiting time for the system update is too short, resulting in the update not being completed. Please proceed as follows.
1. When upgrading from 5600 to version 5620 or 5650, please wait 30 minutes after uploading the update and displaying that the upload is complete before proceeding to the next step.
2. Please wait more than 15 minutes for other updates, because after the update package is uploaded, it takes time to gradually apply it to the system.
3. Except for the marked parts, the rest of the revisions should gradually show revisions 5.6.0.0->5.7.0.0...and so on.



 



Thanks



Jay

Hello,

1. If the update does not install and you do not see the version change in the UI the subsequent patches will not start installing because they will notice the wrong server version.

2. Instead of reinstalling we could have a remote connection to check what patches have been applied.
Not sure what patch you applied so far.  Can you please let me know?

3. A reboot is not needed but the customer needs to wait after applying a patch.

Kind regards

Hi Support



 



Thank you for your replies

I have a few questions I want to clarify. Because TSMC may see the green words and implement it all the way.
1. If we do not wait 30 minutes when upgrading to version 5.6.0.0, will subsequent installations fail?
2. If we did not take a snapshot before upgrading to 5.6.0.0, is it recommended to reinstall the system?
3. Are there any other precautions to take when upgrading from 5.7.1.0 to 5.9.3.0? For example, does the user want to reboot or wait?



 



Best Regards



Jay



 


 



Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?7?2? ?? ??2:49???





Hello,

Before applying anything did you create the VM snapshot?
If yes please return to that snapshot.

Then, the server being version 5.6.0.0 you need to start with the below patch.
All patches need to be applied in turn as describen in the list I sent. Ex. 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0.

For the first one please be sure that you have at least 30% free disk space.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500575650.tar.gz - partitioning

Apply it to the server and leave it for 30 minutes to finish installing.
After you apply a patch it needs time to install.

Then you take the next available one and apply it.
After applying wait 10 to 20 minutes for it to install, and refresh the browser page.
If the patch installed correctly you will see the version change on the UI.
Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.7.0.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500555700.tar.gz

After confirming the version change you can apply the next patch and repeat the process.

Epp 5.7.0.0 to 5.7.1.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500585710.tar.gz

Kind regards

Hi Support



 



I tried updating to 5.9.3.0, no error message appeared, but the version number was not updated either.
The currently displayed version is still 5.6.0.0. I tried to upgrade to version 5.8 again, but the version number still has not been updated.
Please take a look at the attached video. Are there any operating errors?

Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?7?2? ?? ??12:06???





Hello,

1. The version will change. You can refresh the Browser page to see if the version on the bottom right changed. If it changes after you apply a patch, the patch is applied.
The exception is the Epp 5.6.0.0 to 5.6.5.0 patch that only changes a setting.

2. On older servers that do not have access to live update the users can check the current Epp client version available from System Configuration > Client Software.

3. The only indication is in Dashboard > Live update.


Kind regards

Hi Support



 



Thanks for your response.



In theory, I have upgraded the system to 5.9.3.0, and nothing seems to have changed.

I want to clarify a few key issues
1. When using offline patches, will the version number of the EPP system not change?
2. If the version number does not change, how do managers know which version they are currently using?
3. If during the update process, something is omitted or the update order is wrong, will the system display it or present it in other ways? For example, system abnormality?



 



Br,



Jay



 



 



Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?7?1? ?? ??6:39???





Hello,

The version does not change but the necessary changes have been made.
If you want you can continue the update to 5.9.3.0 and user the Epp clients below.

MacOS:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar

Windows:  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Hi Support



 



I used the update file you provided. 



After the update was completed, the version seemed to remain at the oldest version.
I still can't see the version number, TSMC says it can be seen and remains at 5.6.0.0.



What is the problem?







Jay

Thanks for the tip! 



 



TSMC is trying to use.



This extends to another problem. If the system cannot access the Internet, Live Update will stay on this screen.



Is this right?


If the Server cannot access the Internet, how can I know the current version of the Server?

Hi Support



 



I simulated an environment where the TSMC network was closed to the outside world and tried to use MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.gz, but the result still failed.
May I ask what is the reason?



 



If the network is not open to the outside world, click ""send request"" and the following message will appear
""This feature requires a functional Internet Connection for Endpoint Protector Server.""



 



Jay



 



Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?27? ?? ??7:52???





Hello,

Yes the file is 8k

The file does not need to be unzipped. The server expects tar.gz.

In ""Dashboard > Live Update > Offline Patch uploader"".
You select the respective offline patch. Wait for the patch to be uploaded. Then return to Live update to see the status of the instalation.
Once the status comfirmas the install is complete you an apply the next patch.


Kind regards

Hi Support



 



Thank you for your quick reply.



 



I added ""http://download.endpointprotector.com/"" to the Edge whitelist and obtained the same 8k GZ file. Is this file correct?
If correct, does this archive need to be unzipped?
The execution process is that I can directly select the file to upload on the Live update screen of the EPP system?



 



Br,



Jay



 



Netwrix Support <techsupport@netwrix.com> ? 2024?6?27? ?? ??4:45???

Hi Support



 



Have a nice day.



Regarding the previously mentioned problem that the COM Port simulation device cannot be blocked, the tester has provided MAC records.
please see Attachment.

TSMC is currently entering the formal POC and has encountered some problems.
I have summarized it into two key points, please help.
1. TSMC is an environment that is 100% inaccessible to external connections. They need to manually enable the update package of the EPP Server.



(There was a download point for ""MP-EPP4-ENABLE-CAP.tar.GZ"" before, but the file seemed unable to be downloaded normally.



If you want to provide files that may be blocked by anti-virus software, please help compress them into encrypted files.)







 



2. TSMC’s servers need to be updated to the latest version, and you need to provide an update package for them to download manually.

The most urgent thing at the moment is to enable TSMC to successfully activate the server and upgrade it offline to the latest version.
TSMC EPP Server version : 5.6.0.0



 



Thanks for your help



Jay
