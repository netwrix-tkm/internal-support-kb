I tried having them update policies and also sync with our MDM.

As I understand it, tamper protection means I won't be able to do much to repair or reinstall - especially remotely - using standard tools at my disposal via Intune/MEM/Entra. Is there some tool/script/etc or other process that you can provide or advise on? Ideally we can repair remotely without needing much in the way of user action.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-07T14:58:52.000Z"

The Epp agent was not deployed correctly, as it has a placeholder value for the server IP Address ""EPP_server_IP"" instead of the real server IP.
We asked the customer to verify and fix the deployment configuration/script.","","","","005Qk000002i2OLIAY","2025-04-17T15:00:52.000Z"
