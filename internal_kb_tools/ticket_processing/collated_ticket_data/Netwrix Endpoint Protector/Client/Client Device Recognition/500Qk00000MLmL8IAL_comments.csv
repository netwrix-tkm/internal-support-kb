@WaitingOnEngineer

The issue here is related to the EXEs and DLLs of the EPP client detected as not signed by it. Please check in the team about the older cases related to it. The previous reports were related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related)

I have asked the customer to check either Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Customer said they would need to know which root certificate to check for. Their machines are not internet connected.

Can you please advise.

Thank you!

Situations like this one are a waste of time for the Development team. And the Support team as well. We had similar cases before and those are documented in ADO. Unfortunately the Support team does not have access to ADO cases. This is the most recent case that I can remember:


 https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/349119  (related Salesforce: 00417056). 

I left there some details and linked the issue to some Jira cases. Jira is closed now but you can find the items under the same details (and case number) in ADO as well (the EPP legacy project). There are several comments in the threads, I can't just copy paste them here.
