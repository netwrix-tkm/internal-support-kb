Removal of EPP client Software is not possible due to blocked communication ways (the EPP removal tool cannot be installed at the client). An Offline Temporary Password could be generated at the server and was accepted by the client software, but the blockade is continuing (see picture 1). Additionally it seems that there is a mismatch at the client software between the user name and the user ID / eMail (see picture 2): KSAdmin doesn't have this user ID or eMail adress. What can I do to solve the problem?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-25T12:00:13.000Z"

Customer was unable to uninstall the EPP Client due to it being greyed out via Control Panel and Settings.  The EPP client also accepted the Universal and Device OTPs but did not lift the denied rights / restrictions.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-27T09:53:34.000Z"

The vb script was successful in removing the EP client.  Normal functionality of the computer was restored after the remove of EPP client.  Case can be closed.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-27T09:55:43.000Z"
