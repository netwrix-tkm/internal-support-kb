No change.

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

No change.

 

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

No change.

 

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please try the below script:

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

Please let me know if the machines are Windows computers or macOS. I will send you a script to change/add the IP or FQDN to the EPP client, so it can connect to the EPP server.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

No change.

 

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates: https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates 

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:


2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.

5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

No change.

 

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please try the below script:

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates: https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates 

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:


2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.

5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

Hi Kevin,

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates: https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:
[Image_2025-03-27_23-35-55.png]

2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.
[Image_2025-03-27_23-41-47.png]
5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

No change.



Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Please try the below script:

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates: https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates 

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:


2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.

5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

No change.

 

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please try the below script:

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

Please let me know if the machines are Windows computers or macOS. I will send you a script to change/add the IP or FQDN to the EPP client, so it can connect to the EPP server.

Hi Kevin,

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates: https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:
[cid:image002.png@01DBA313.6A4FC380]

2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.
[cid:image003.png@01DBA313.6A4FC380]
5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

No change.



Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please try the below script:

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

Apologies for the delay on this.

Please let me know if you have availability for a remote session tomorrow and we will go over the steps together. We would need access to one of the affected computers.

I will also attach a link from where some of our customers download their missing certificates:  https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates

The steps we would like to go through are:

1. Going into File Explorer and going to the EPP folder:


2. Accessing the Properties of the EPPNotifier -> Digital Signature Details -> View Certificate.
3. We will screenshot the certificate name and then look to see if it is missing.
4. We will check certmgr.msc -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates -> expand the Friendly name column.

5 We will compare to see if the screenshot-ed certificate is missing.

Hi Kevin,

We have received an update from our devs on this.

We had some cases in the past related to integrity fail issues and EPP notifier not being signed. Usually this is fixed with either some Windows updates or some Root Certificate Authorities that need to be installed on the machines (Global Sign related).

Can you please check to see if this resolves the issue on your side?

Is this application just updating the settings ofr ws_server ws_port and DepartmentCode in the registry? Or is it doing other things as well? All those registry settings were already set to the correct values. I have uninstalled the agent. Removed all folders in program files and CoSoSysEPP in system32.

Hi Kevin,

Please try the below script:

http://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/ClientIPChange.zip

Please let us know if after setting the IP or FQDN, if the EPP clients that did not communicate with the EPP server will communicate afterwards.

Hi Kevin,

Please let me know if the machines are Windows computers or macOS. I will send you a script to change/add the IP or FQDN to the EPP client, so it can connect to the EPP server.
