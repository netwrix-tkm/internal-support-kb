Hi Andrei,

The clients show in the portal so I assume they communicate with the server, as they also show today's date in the last seen column.

We have just done a test where we blocked USB storage devices for a computer but the user was still able to access it.

The icon also did not blink when the user updated policies.

I can try arranging a screen share with the customer if you have any availability.

Kind regards,
Kasia

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
We resolved the communication issue between the client and the server. As you noticed the are 2 computers still without the information.
You can allow it a day to see if it updates.
If it does not you can start the log on them and see if the same error shows. If it does you can try to reinstall the client for them or we can schedule a meeting to reregister the clients.

Kind regards
