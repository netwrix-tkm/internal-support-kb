"500Qk00000MHJUcIAP","00436897","Support Ticket","A Client computer is totally blocked","The EPP client software blocks all external access methods to the client computer: LAN access via docking station blocked, WLAN blocked, USB stick blocked, Internet access blocked. Removal of EPP client Software is not possible due to blocked communication ways (the EPP removal tool cannot be installed at the client). An Offline Temporary Password could be generated at the server and was accepted by the client software, but the blockade is continuing (see picture 1). Additionally it seems that there is a mismatch at the client software between the user name and the user ID / eMail (see picture 2): KSAdmin doesn't have this user ID or eMail adress. What can I do to solve the problem?","","The Endpoint Protector client disabled the Wi-Fi adapter as well as Ethernet LAN access via docking station, USB Storage devices were blocked. Customer was unable to uninstall the EPP Client due to it being greyed out via Control Panel and Settings.  The EPP client also accepted the Universal and Device OTPs but did not lift the denied rights / restrictions.","We provided the customer with a vb script file that needs to be executed via CLI with administrator rights.  The vb script was successful in removing the EP client.  Normal functionality of the computer was restored after the remove of EPP client.  Case can be closed.","We provided the customer with a vb script file that needs to be executed via CLI with administrator rights.  The vb script was successful in removing the EP client.
