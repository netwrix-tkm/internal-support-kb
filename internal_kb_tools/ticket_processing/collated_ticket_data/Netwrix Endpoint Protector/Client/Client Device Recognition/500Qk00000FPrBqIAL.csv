Our deployed system has several CentOS 7 clients (10 out of 18) reporting as ""Offline"" in the webpage. 

On one of the clients, we instructed the operator of our system to re-install the client software, but that has not made a difference. We noticed that the <a href='https://options.ini' target='_blank'>options.ini</a> file includes the following line:
expired=1

We have never seen this line in the configuration file before; the file is also missing options such as ""ws_port"", ""ws_server"", and ""DepartmentCode"" (among others).

The licenses page within EPP does *not* show any license issues for Device Control or for the individual client licenses. The license still shows as attached to the client.","","05Nov: Test build being tested at customer.
