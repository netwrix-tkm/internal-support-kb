Hi Joe,

Thank you for reaching out.

To uninstall the EPP client software on Windows, you can use the following command:
msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Please let us know if this resolves your issue, or if you'd like to schedule a remote session for further investigation.

Hi Iosif,

Thanks for checking in. I think I have something working now - I am waiting
on Intune to deploy to the test machine so I can get confirmation. In a
local test, I was able to see in powershell that the install date had been
updated, so I think we are looking good on that front.

Once I have confirmation there, I'll try deploying to a device that is
actually having the issue. We'll have to see whether that fixes the issue
of the device not being visible by the server though.

Cheers,

Ticket Number: 00441161
Ticket Subject: Devices not populating in the admin console External
Ticket Details: We're having an issue where at least one of our users has a Windows machine that has EPP installed and running but their device is not being seen by the server / admin console. I tried having them update policies and also sync with our MDM.

As I understand it, tamper protection means I won't be able to do much to repair or reinstall - especially remotely - using standard tools at my disposal via Intune/MEM/Entra. Is there some tool/script/etc or other process that you can provide or advise on? Ideally we can repair remotely without needing much in the way of user action.

Thank you!

We have at least 8 Windows laptops for which this is the case. The scenario
is that EPP is installed, running, and presumably working, but our EPP
admin console cannot see that device. I can see a successful install and
app detection in Intune.
Since this is not a single-user/device scenario, I'm attempting to create
what is essentially a repair tool that can be deployed with Intune. When I
run this locally, things seem to go okay. When I attempt remote deployment,
I'm actually not even getting logs.

I actually don't see that lower right hand section at all in the client. (This screenshot is from a device that is connected to and seen by the console).

We have at least 8 Windows laptops for which this is the case. The scenario is that EPP is installed, running, and presumably working, but our EPP admin console cannot see that device. I can see a successful install and app detection in Intune.

Since this is not a single-user/device scenario, I'm attempting to create what is essentially a repair tool that can be deployed with Intune. When I run this locally, things seem to go okay. When I attempt remote deployment, I'm actually not even getting logs.

Thank you for sending the screenshots.

It appears that for the device not showing in the admin console, the EPP agent was not deployed correctly, as the server IP was not set. In the attached screenshot, you can see that it has a placeholder value ""EPP_server_IP"" instead of the actual server IP address.


 
Could you please verify the deployment configuration and edit the server IP value to match the correct IP/FQDN address?

Thank you!

Hello Joe,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00441161. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00441161
Ticket Subject: Devices not populating in the admin console External
Ticket Details: We're having an issue where at least one of our users has a Windows machine that has EPP installed and running but their device is not being seen by the server / admin console. I tried having them update policies and also sync with our MDM.

As I understand it, tamper protection means I won't be able to do much to repair or reinstall - especially remotely - using standard tools at my disposal via Intune/MEM/Entra. Is there some tool/script/etc or other process that you can provide or advise on? Ideally we can repair remotely without needing much in the way of user action.

Thank you!

Ah, I see now.
Can I make a suggestion for your documentation?
In step 7 you say:

Command-line argument – add the following command line in the text box
    WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress

My suggestion would be to add a note saying something along the lines of
'replace EPP_server_IP with your server IP'
or maybe saying YOUR_EPP_SERVER_IP.

Thank you for the suggestion. We will update the documentation.
Let me know if the EPP Client is now communicating with the EPP Server and if the ticket can be closed.

Ah, I see now.

Can I make a suggestion for your documentation?

In step 7 you say:


Command-line argument – add the following command line in the text box
    WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress
 

My suggestion would be to add a note saying something along the lines of 'replace EPP_server_IP with your server IP'

or maybe saying YOUR_EPP_SERVER_IP.

Hi Joe,

Thank you for sending the screenshots.

It appears that for the device not showing in the admin console, the EPP agent was not deployed correctly, as the server IP was not set. In the attached screenshot, you can see that it has a placeholder value ""EPP_server_IP"" instead of the actual server IP address.


 
Could you please verify the deployment configuration and edit the server IP value to match the correct IP/FQDN address?

Thank you!

I actually don't see that lower right hand section at all in the client. (This screenshot is from a device that is connected to and seen by the console).

We have at least 8 Windows laptops for which this is the case. The scenario is that EPP is installed, running, and presumably working, but our EPP admin console cannot see that device. I can see a successful install and app detection in Intune.

Since this is not a single-user/device scenario, I'm attempting to create what is essentially a repair tool that can be deployed with Intune. When I run this locally, things seem to go okay. When I attempt remote deployment, I'm actually not even getting logs.

Ticket Details: We're having an issue where at least one of our users has a Windows machine that has EPP installed and running but their device is not being seen by the server / admin console. I tried having them update policies and also sync with our MDM.

As I understand it, tamper protection means I won't be able to do much to repair or reinstall - especially remotely - using standard tools at my disposal via Intune/MEM/Entra. Is there some tool/script/etc or other process that you can provide or advise on? Ideally we can repair remotely without needing much in the way of user action.
