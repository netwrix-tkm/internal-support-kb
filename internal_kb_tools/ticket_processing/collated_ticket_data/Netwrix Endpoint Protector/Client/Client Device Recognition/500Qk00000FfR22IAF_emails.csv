Hi Adrian,

Yes I do, feedback received so far from IT admins is that the test build that was deployed or installed on endpoints having the audio issues are all working fine  now.

So, it seems the test build resolved the issue related to audio devices.

Kind Regards

Dear Jovan,

There was one more case where a customer experienced some difficulties with some USB Audio Headsets and this test build fixed their problem.
Prior to collecting logs about this I wanted to eliminate this possible situation and to see if the test build works for you.
Please let me know if you consider that you need help in detecting the problem and I can join in a session with you.

Good Day,

Just an update on the below.

The test build was installed on one computer to see if it helped with the audio issue experienced. It helped to a certain extent; I am still not 100% confident that this issue is related to Endpoint Protector.

I have asked that the agent be uninstalled on one of the machines experiencing this issue to see if it is linked. Have you had any of you other customers report this issue recently? Is it possible that installing the agent with no active policy can impact or corrupt any driver (audio drivers to be exact)?

Kind Regards
