So far I've only had 2 PCs affected

 

On the Client PC:

- The Endpoint Protector agent says that it manages to contact the server ""Last server connection: 2024-07-10 15h55"".

 

On the Server:

- The PC appears offline

 

When I try to update the agent policies on the Client PC: Nothing happens

 

I searched the system event log and found this error every time I clicked on ""Update policies now"".


 I've tried uninstalling the agent and reinstalling it but it does exactly the same thing.
Is there a solution to this problem?","","","","Issue was resolved in remote session - Case Closed","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Device Recognition","NONE","","83.3","Closed - Resolved","IP Steel","Luc VANTROOST","2024-07-11T07:14:03.000Z","2024-10-02T13:36:40.000Z"
