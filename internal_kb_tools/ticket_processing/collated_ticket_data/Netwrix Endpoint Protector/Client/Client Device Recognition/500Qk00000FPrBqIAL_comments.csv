Hello,
I suspect that the EPP client can not communicate with the server.
A log for an affected machine will help to confirm this issue.
So could you please collect some logs? (epp_client_daemon.log)

Suggest a quick test with log file epp_client_daemon_append.log also.
If that doesn't work we will setup a remote session.

Hello,

I tested EPP of a similar but not exact version and the logging worked as expected. I would please ask the customer to provide their install package for v1.3.1.5 to test locally with their version.

I also have some more tests for them to run:

	 - 	Please provide the output of ""journalctl --system""; maybe there is something in the system log about blocking access to the log file
	 - 	I would also suggest a test run of epp-client-daemon with strace to see information about the log file access; please make sure the service is stopped; also check with ""ps -aux | grep epp"" that epp-client-daemon isn't running; then run ""sudo strace /opt/cososys/sbin/epp-client-daemon -e 2>&1 | tee epp-strace""; Ctrl-C after the startup sequence is done; and send the generated ""epp-strace"" file to us

It seems that version of EPP does not generate logs.
We've built a new version of EPP that should work as expected.

Hi Zachary, @WaitingOnEngineer,

I have received confirmation from our dev team that Delphi Pascal is not supported as a source code.

If this is a requirement from the customer, please raise a feature request on the product board, however, please be aware that this is not easily achievable, so it might not be prioritised.

Regards,
Cristi

Once installed, the customer saw the machine no longer show as offline in the console and they are hoping that this resolved their original issue.

Question that they do have is, is there an alternative method to open the endpoint protector client window on linux? They have found the issue to be intermittent, but sometimes when they right click the EPP icon, the context menu does not appear. They are looking for a workaround in case this does occur to still be able to get to the EPP Client window.","005Qk000002Fjy9IAC","2024-10-24T20:10:44.000Z","2024-10-24T20:10:44.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer
Hello,
On version 1.7.0.7 there is no alternative way of opening the notifier. Make sure the About dialog window is not open (it prevents the right-click menu from opening). Other than that they could try to kill the notifier and reopen it: pkill epp-client
