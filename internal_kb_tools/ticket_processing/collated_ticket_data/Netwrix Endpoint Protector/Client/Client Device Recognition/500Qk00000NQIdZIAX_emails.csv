Before updating, please be sure to create a VM snapshot to have a safe point.

Please be sure to upload only one patch and wait for it to finish installing before uploading the next.
To update the server, please apply the below patch to the server from ""Device Control > Live Update > Offline Patch Uploader"".
Upload it and wait 5 to 10 minutes, then refresh the webpage to see the version in the lower right corner.
Once the first patch is finished, you can apply the next patch.
After it is updated, you can download the new Epp client.

Epp 5.9.3.0 to Epp 5.9.4.0
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP00656940.tar.gz  
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz

On the Epp server, is any device set to block?
Can you try to allow all devices to see if the issue remains?

Kind regards

Thanks Matt and Andrei,

Whilst we still have a little more testing to do I can confirm that the upgrade appears to have fixed our initial problem.  The virtual hard drives presented to our VMs are no longer being restricted under the latest EPP client.

Thank you for everyone's assistance, I am happy for this support request to be closed.  We will reach out again if we encounter any further issues.
