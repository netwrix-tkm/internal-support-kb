We have installed the EPP client Version 6.2.2.1 on a Windows 11 virtual machine and find that the product prevents access to the virtual machines additional virtual hard drives, e.g. it’s hard drives on D: or E: drive in our example are inaccessible, the C: drive containing the Operating System files is fine.  Virtual CDROM drives are unaffected.  When attempting to access the Hard drives we get a Windows Explorer error message stating “D: is not accessible.  Access is Denied”.

The EPP client shows no devices as being blocked, the EPP console shows no devices as being blocked for the virtual machine in its logs.  Disabling the EPP client via a temporary offline password does not resolve the issue.  The drives are accessible again as soon as the EPP client is uninstalled.

We would like to upgrade to the latest version of EPP in the first instance to see if this resolves the issue.  Could access to the upgrade files please be provided?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-28T01:49:38.000Z"
