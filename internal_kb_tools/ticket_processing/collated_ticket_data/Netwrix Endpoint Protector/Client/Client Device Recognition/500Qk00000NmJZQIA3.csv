"500Qk00000NmJZQIA3","00441161","Support Ticket","Devices not populating in the admin console External","We're having an issue where at least one of our users has a Windows machine that has EPP installed and running but their device is not being seen by the server / admin console. I tried having them update policies and also sync with our MDM.

As I understand it, tamper protection means I won't be able to do much to repair or reinstall - especially remotely - using standard tools at my disposal via Intune/MEM/Entra. Is there some tool/script/etc or other process that you can provide or advise on? Ideally we can repair remotely without needing much in the way of user action.","","We provided the msiexec command to uninstall the epp client.

The customer confirmed he is making progress with the MDM deployment.

The customer is saying his fix is not working, and we asked for more details of this deployment issue.

The Epp agent was not deployed correctly, as it has a placeholder value for the server IP Address ""EPP_server_IP"" instead of the real server IP.
We asked the customer to verify and fix the deployment configuration/script.","Waiting for the customer's confirmation on the deployment success.

Waiting for a detailed description of the issue.

Waiting for the customer to redeploy the EPP agent after fixing the deployment script(setting a proper server IP address).","Solved after the IP was changed for the EPP Client.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Device Recognition","","","11.2","Closed - Resolved","Alloy","Joe Cacciapaglia","2025-04-07T14:58:52.000Z","2025-04-18T20:25:34.000Z"
