Hello, 
I've teste this in QA env, server version 710, https://hr7uvtw.unify.endpointprotector.com
EPP client version: 6.2.2.3001, the same one present in the client's logs and could not reproduce this issue.
The Justification has a minimum character limit set to 10 and the device can be remediated in the EPP client notifier when adding 10 or more characters to the justification.

Hi @Alin Anca  the development team was not able to reproduce the issue with the provided details.  
If the issue is still present a remote connection will be necessary.
Thanks,

@Cecilia-Maria Iepure we had a call with the customer today, the issue was solved after he saved the justification again, individually.
The ticket can be closed.
