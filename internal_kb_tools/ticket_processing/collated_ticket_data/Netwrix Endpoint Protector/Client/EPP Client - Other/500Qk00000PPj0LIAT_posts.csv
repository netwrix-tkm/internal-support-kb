We want to confirm the behavior regarding the policy interval refresh rate as it relates to the Active Directory sync. As detailed in the attached document, we have configured the policy interval refresh on the computer to 600 seconds (10 minutes), and the Active Directory sync is set to occur every 6 hours. However, we have noticed a discrepancy as the policy received time on the computer does not correspond with either the policy interval refresh rate or the Active Directory sync schedule.

Additionally, could you confirm if disabling the Active Directory sync would result in the policy interval refresh rate taking precedence?

Thank you for your support. 

Regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-21T08:26:37.000Z"
