We managed to install the EPP Client on RHEL9.4 but after we close the Endpoint Protector Notifier, there is no EPP icon for us to do Policy Update. Also with the Endpoint Protector Notifier, there is no option to do Policy Update as well.

Please advise how do we do a Policy update.

Thank you!
Best regards,
Yi Zhen","","The Cient icon is not visible in the icon tray.
Even after client reinstall.","","Info provided.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","13.4","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2025-02-13T02:57:14.000Z","2025-02-26T12:31:20.000Z"
