Engineering got back to me and asked me to collect some new information. A recording of deleting the computers and how they are still there after a short while along with the developer console opened.
They also mentioned that on the computers that were last seen longer than 2 months in your case, those computers may be reporting erroneously to the server and the last seen is not changed.
The recommended action is to make sure the agents are uninstalled.
Please let me know when you have availability for a remote session.

Thank you,

Hi James,

I received a new set of commands to run in the backend. This will re-register all the computers and after that, when the agent communicates with the server, the computer is licensed and online. Else, it remains as unlicensed.
Please let me know your availability for next week.

Thank you,

Hi James,

My colleague Eduard is OOO and I will be taking over this ticket.

We have received an update from our devs regarding this.

Please let me know the below:
1. Is the EPP server hosted on your end?
2. Is it hosted on a VM, AWS, Azure or GCP platform
3. Do you have availability next week for a remote session so we can try and apply the fix our devs suggested and see if it resolves the issue?

Best Regards,

Just the console is enough as we delete them from the interface and then check to see if they appear again.
We can try to see if we can also check this one in the meeting tomorrow and if not, we can schedule another meeting.

As I mentioned on the other ticket, I thought we already had a meeting set up and I just saw that it is not the case. I asked there if you are available tomorrow at 12 PM EST, and if not, what about Friday or next week? We can set 2 hours to make sure we have time to go through all the tickets.
