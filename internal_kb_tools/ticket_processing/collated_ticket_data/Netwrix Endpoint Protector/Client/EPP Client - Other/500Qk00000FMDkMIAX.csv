Since a few days we have for specific user S/N : LRLY71T09K a problem. It appears that suddenly in the morning he can't browse any website at all not matter what is the browser he uses (Safari, Firefox, Chrome). The pages keeps loading but ultimately get an error. 

However, when i tried on his MacBook some command on the Terminal like CURL, PING -T or TRACEROUTE i was able to see some results and to reach the website destination. 

After some time investigating, i finally noticed that the Certificate status of EndPoint Protector certificate status is now marked as NO and the Trusted status is NO but only in the client application. On the server side, the status of the certificate was marked as Trusted. 

After a simple restart it worked fine and everything was back to normal. However after a few days the issue came back. Same behavior and same consequences. I investigated a bit more and tried to remove the Endpoint Protector transparent proxy and suddenly web browsing started to work again. 

So it's definitly related to this. Immeditaly after removed the EP transparent proxy i had this pop-up telling me that  EP wants to add Proxy configuration so that all network activity on this Mac could be filtered and monitored. 

This user in our dashboard is called Mattiâ€™s MacBook Air and he has the same configuration as everyone one. We apply the same global policy to all of our users. 

Do you have any idea of where it comes froms and how to solve it ? Also do you have any client which is impacted by this issue that appeared suddently ten days ago ?","","","","The customer confirms 3.0.4.1003 resolved the issue.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","103.9","Closed - Resolved","HQLAx","Yacine BOUMEKIK","2024-09-05T08:48:53.000Z","2024-12-18T05:52:17.000Z"
