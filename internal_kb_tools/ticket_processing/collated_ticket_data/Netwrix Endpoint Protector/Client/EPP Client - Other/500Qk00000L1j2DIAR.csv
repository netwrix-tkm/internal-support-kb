is having trouble with one Windows endpoint system that is unable to establish a connection to the EPP Server. The prospect have deployed 7 endpoints but the 8th Windows endpoint is not able to make a connection to the EPP Server and get registered.
The epp endpoints are sending TCP traffic over port 446, the customer is re-routing this traffic over port 443 to reach the EPP Server.

I had a remote session with the customer and we uninstalled the existing EPP client with logs and database removed, rebooted the system and then reinstalled the EPP Client.
We collected logs from two computers, one that is working fine and the other that is not making contact with the EPP Server.","Logs submitted to R&D for further analysis","Hello Muhammad,
