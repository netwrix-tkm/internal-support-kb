@WaitingOnEngineer
Hello,

We need more information.

Before attempting a shutdown/reboot:
sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log
sudo systemctl restart epp-client-daemon

Reboot.

After reboot collect epp_client_daemon_append.log and reboot.log as follows:
sudo journalctl -b-1 --system > reboot.log

Customer found a workaround to the Ubuntu 24 EPP shutdown/restart issue: manually edit this file and make the following changes ""TimeoutSec=30sec""
instead of ""TimeoutSec=5min"" it shuts the machine down in 30 seconds. sudo systemctl edit --full epp-client-daemon.service.

Thank you!

It's true that is a workaround, but not a solution for the issue. It would have been nice to find out what the issue was so we can fix it and not encounter it in the future.
