"500Qk00000FVmfdIAD","00420409","Support Ticket","Post-Update Web Browsing Issues Report","Dear Team,

Following the recent update based on the documentation from NetWrix regarding known vulnerabilities, we took proactive steps to enhance our system's security by updating our server and endpoints to the latest available versions. 

Here are the actions we have completed:
- Server Update: Upgraded to the latest version 5.9.4.0.
- Endpoint Updates: Updated Windows and macOS devices to the latest versions, 6.2.3.1 and 3.0.3.1, respectively, via the Client Software Upgrade from the dashboard.

However, since implementing these updates, several users have reported experiencing issues with web browsing. 

Specific problems include:
- Difficulty loading certain web pages
- ""WebSocket"" connection issues, with some pages failing to load entirely

We conducted preliminary investigations to identify whether these issues were related to connectivity, the web application, or device-specific concerns. Our findings indicate that this is not the case. 

As a troubleshooting measure, we disabled Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on two devices, which allowed users to load previously inaccessible websites. While this served as a temporary workaround, it is not an ideal long-term solution.

Could you please advise on any actions we can take on our end to mitigate these web browsing issues? It is important to note that most of the affected devices are Macs, and, so far, no Windows devices have reported similar problems.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Agustin Llovet","","","","Customer confirmed that the ticket can be closed","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","72.1","Closed - Resolved","Stensul","Agustin Llovet","2024-09-09T13:31:50.000Z","2024-11-20T14:49:18.000Z"
