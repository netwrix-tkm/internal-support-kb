""Hello Alin,

We haven't heard from the customer in a while. The issue has been resolved, but the customer inquired about the sudden stop in email alerts. Since the issue cannot be reproduced, thereâ€™s no way to determine the cause. We can proceed with closing the case.""","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","108.9","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2024-06-28T09:01:07.000Z","2024-10-15T07:39:06.000Z"
