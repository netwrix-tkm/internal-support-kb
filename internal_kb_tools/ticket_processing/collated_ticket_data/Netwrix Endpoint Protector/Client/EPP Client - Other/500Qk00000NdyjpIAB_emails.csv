As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

Hello Kantikirit,

We apologize for the inconvenience. Due to the upcoming remote sessions that we've already had for today the schedule, the only availability for us would be tomorrow or Thursday.

Could you please provide us 2-3 timeslots that would work for you so we can schedule the remote session?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Kantikirit,

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As we have agreed during the remote session, before deleting the shadows, try to get the approval from your manager and get back to us so we can proceed further with deleting them.

I will wait for your response.

Thank you very much for your time and patience today.

To recap what we've done today was to delete the shadows from the sda5 partition that was around 95% occupied.

We deleted shadows older than 60 days and the occupation percentage went down around 40 so you have now a lot more space to use.

Additional numbers may be available upon entering the conference.  Additional Numbers

Meeting Number

Password

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom
