The good news is that we were are able to reproduce this issue and are working on a fix. For now our customer can use the workaround to grant ""Allow Access"" permissions to the ""Unknown Device"" category.
As for their question:

> ""If the blocking is done by the EPP Agent, why is no User Remediation displayed? I also could not find a report entry for ""Unknown Device"". Do ""Unknown Devices"" not generate any entries?

the reply is:

The ""Unknown Device"" category doesn't represent a real peripheral device that is connected to the PC. There are no logs or remediation pop-ups related to the ""Unknown Device"".

Endpoint Protector only uses the access right assigned to the ""Unknown Device"" category and sets it to storage volumes detected by our driver for which we fail to detect an attached peripheral or internal device such as a disk or a USB thumb-drive.

I wish the above would be documented in our user manual. FYI @Cecilia-Maria Iepure @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Can you please confirm if the customer still requires a test build for this issue?

Dev team found a fix and if needed, a test build can be provided on Monday the latest.

It seems that the SF ticket has been closed.

Thank you,
Cristi

@WaitingOnEngineer @Cecilia-Maria Iepure

I don't think we need logs anymore, I managed to reproduce the issue. It happens only when the drive doesn't have a drive letter assigned in Windows before using Rufus on it.

So while we investigate, we can tell our customers (as a workaround) that the fix will work on USB thumbdrives that have a valid partition recognized by Windows.

The fix does not work on other drives because it assumed they always had a drive letter and thus the EPP service was able to communicate to the device control driver the original ""allow"" right  for the device.
