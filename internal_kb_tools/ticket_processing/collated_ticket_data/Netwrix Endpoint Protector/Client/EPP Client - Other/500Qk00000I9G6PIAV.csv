"500Qk00000I9G6PIAV","00426634","Support Ticket","Since going up to EPP 6.2.3.1010 we have lost the ability to print from outlook","Although our print queues are still green ticks in EPP client, we cannot print from Outlook as each of our clients went from 6.2.2.1006.  Although it seems strange that other applications (and even OWA) are unaffected- the timeline and attached picture does seem to suggest EPP client, any assistance would be most welcome.","","","","Deactivated MTP for them as the printing was not working and they didn't have a CAP module license.
