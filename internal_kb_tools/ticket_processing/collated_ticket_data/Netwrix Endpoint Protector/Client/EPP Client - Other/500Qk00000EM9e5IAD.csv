"500Qk00000EM9e5IAD","00417921","Support Ticket","MacOS Sequoia Notifications","In the next version of macOS, Apple is being a lot more aggressive about user notification of applications that are monitoring/scanning/or otherwise making external connections to wireless/bluetooth devices, so popups like the example attached are going to happen. 
Apple is currently not willing to allow us to suppress/allow-list this behavior, so at the very least Cososys might need to actually say what they are doing instead of having this generic error that people are going to click 'Don't allow"" most of the time.
Can you please let us know what EPP is currently doing to prevent this ?
If no prevention is possible, provide a list of ALL possible notifications the user would receive.","","","","Questions were answered","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","62.1","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Henrique Praxedes","2024-08-13T11:19:43.000Z","2024-10-14T13:55:16.000Z"
