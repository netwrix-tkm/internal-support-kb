Quazi contacted us stating that the personal gmail access is prohibited o organization and is asking for support


22/05/2025
Connected remote with Qazi to take a look at the issue.
The problem is for about 32 MAC devices where the GMAIL business accounts functionality is not working properly.
He added helo.ai and it works only for Windows but for MAC OS he can login with the personal gmail account on every browser.
What we did was to go on the computer settings-> enable intercept VPN and also made sure the Repeat VPN notification was selected.
Also, checked the full disk, accessibility and bluetooth access and everything was allowed for the EPP along with the network extension.

We did a reinstall + restart but that didn't do any help.
Also the certificate was enabled and trusted.

We collected the debug logs and agreed to get back as soon as possible because this is a critical issue for them.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-22T11:18:34.000Z"

Connected to Qazi along with Andre to take a look at the issue.
Seems like most of the things I checked were in place except for the fact that the client did not had the device assigned to any CAP policy.
The DPI will not work if there are no CAP policies assigned to the device.

Assigned a policy to the device, and updated the policy. As soon as we updated the Network extension pop up came up accordingly.

After enabling it, we tested and the GMAIL personal account could be blocked accordingly.

Did the same test on 2 other devices and it was working as expected.
Agreed to keep the ticket opened until the client checks with the other devices.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-23T12:23:01.000Z"

Connected remote with the client to assist with a MAC OS where they had the same issue.
This time, this MAC OS had the Monterey version, which was pretty old.
We had to allow third party apps 'EndpointProtector' to make changes from privacy and security.
After enabling that, the network extension came up and we tested again and it was working as expected.

Client asked if it's possible to have a solution from preventing users that have admin credentials to disable the network extension.

Informed that it is out of our scope in regards of that as this is something they need to handle on an organizational level.

Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-06-03T09:26:07.000Z"
