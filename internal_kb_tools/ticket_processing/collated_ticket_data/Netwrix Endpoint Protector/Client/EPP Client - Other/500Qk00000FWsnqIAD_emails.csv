Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hey Matt,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the “Outlook” process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate


Please test it and let me know if it works.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Hey Matt,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the ""Outlook"" process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Hey Matt,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the “Outlook” process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate


Please test it and let me know if it works.

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the ""Outlook"" process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate

Please test it and let me know if it works.

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Thank you,

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the “Outlook” process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate


Please test it and let me know if it works.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the ""Outlook"" process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Hey Matt,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the “Outlook” process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Thank you,

Hi Matt,

The devs are aware of this issue and are working on a fix, until then we have a workaround.
Add the ""Outlook"" process to an exception in System Parameters -> Advanced Scanning Exceptions. Type Outlook and add to content then press Generate

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Thank you,

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

In this case, before we set up a remote session, please allow me to ask one of the engineers from the dev team for guidance, they might have some other insights either for the workaround or for what information to collect from you.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #420462 -  - Outlook  PDF Printer    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0FWsnq:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","mabbondanza@singlesourceproperty.com","","eduard.nut@netwrix.com","true","2024-11-08T19:47:17.000Z","true"

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hey Matt,

I'm glad the workaround works. Engineering suggested that we gather some logs, and open another internal ticket for this just in case you have a different scenario than the ones they tested with for the workaround. This would require us to remove the workaround in place and reproduce the issue while logs are active.
The workaround will be included with one of the next server versions, and if it works for you and the other cases, it should fix it.
If you prefer not to go ahead with troubleshooting and wait for the fix just let me know.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, I wanted to provide you with an update on  this issue.  It seems like the workaround may be working for us now.  I had multiple people continue to have the issue (including myself) yesterday after implementing the workaround (even after a reboot), however, today we all seem to be able to print to pdf again.  I am not sure if this is going to be stable but wanted to let you know.  If you have any other suggestions or guidance I would still prefer to discuss just in case this workaround continues to be inconsistent.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Engineering got back to me today and said that starting from 5941 just settings ""Block print if CAP cannot process file:"" from the computer/global settings page to DISABLE will solve the problem.
So this should be solved with the next update which is targeted in the first half of December.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.  Do you have an ETA for the next release?

Hi Matt,

Engineering got back to me today and said that starting from 5941 just settings ""Block print if CAP cannot process file:"" from the computer/global settings page to DISABLE will solve the problem.
So this should be solved with the next update which is targeted in the first half of December.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn't work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Hi Eduard, I think I'd prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.

Hey Matt,

I see that the targeted month is November, but to set expectations properly, the fix does not have a set release version, so it might not be included with the next one.
I agree that we should monitor this week and see if you have other issues and take it from there.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, lets monitor the situation for a few days and if the issue persists then we can move forward with gathering logs and additional troubleshooting.  If not, then we will just leave the workaround in place until the fix is released in the next version.

Hi Matt,

Engineering got back to me today and said that starting from 5941 just settings ""Block print if CAP cannot process file:"" from the computer/global settings page to DISABLE will solve the problem.
So this should be solved with the next update which is targeted in the first half of December.

Hey Matt,

I never encountered this issue before. We can also gather them using our support tool. It will have admin elevation and it should be able to remove the files after that.
We can set up another session and gather them or I can send you a guide on how to use it.
Today I'm only available at 6 PM EST, or we can repeat this tomorrow at the same time if it works for you.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Eduard, the file never uploaded to the server.  I tried to zip the 2 files in the C drive and that didn’t work either as it says the sslsplit file is in use.  I disabled debug mode and the sslsplit file was removed and I still get the same error if I try to zip the log file.  Not sure where to go from here?

Hi Matt,

Yes, it would only be turned off for gathering the logs and then re-applied.
Let me know your availability for today and tomorrow and I can set it up.
If you prefer doing that outside work hours, I can also send you steps in gathering them.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, would this just be temporary so that you can gather logs?  If that is the case then yes we can do that. The issue affects multiple users including me so we can use my machine to test and gather logs if necessary.

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to see if you would be willing to ""break"" the exception rule to gather some logs, just to make sure engineering has your side of the issue at hand, this might also make them see that multiple companies have this issue and could help faster deliver the fix.

Thank you,

Hey Matt,

Understandable. I will place it in a postponed state until the fix is available and I will be checking weekly to see if anything changed.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard, I think I’d prefer this to stay open as it is an ongoing issue with an end user.  We have several different things that are not working properly or as expected with EPP and it has turned into a pretty big headache to manage.

Hey Matt,

Even if I do not have a targeted release date for the fix, and since this ticket has been open for a while now, can this be closed as pending fix?
You will still see the ticket in the portal as pending not as closed.
