"500Qk00000GZkWcIAL","00422789","Support Ticket","Realtek audio issue with EPP Client","When an earpiece is unplugged from the 3.5mm jack, the sound/volume panel hangs. It also hangs any meeting software when trying to select a sound device. Per troubleshoot, we found the 2nd Realtek audio device was re-enabled after the 3.5mm was unplugged causing windows to hog/access a device resource that doesn't exist anymore. Traced the root cause to EPP.

If we downgrade EPP client back to v5.9.2.8 everything works fine. The 2nd Realtek audio device enable & disable on plug and unplug, perfect! We upgrade back to v6 and the problem returns again. In the EPP v6 client, we see ""Microsoft / Realtek(R) Audio"" in the device control list. But in v5 client, it's not there. Per testing, we see this ""Microsoft / Realtek(R) Audio)"" is linked to the audio device category under global rights.

This can be replicated across multiple laptop models, Win 10, Win 11. But only with Realtek audio. If not using Realtek audio, no issue. Note that these are inbuild audio on the laptops, not external USB audio device. Users keep coming to IT support for these audio issues after we did a mass upgrade to v6 client. Please assist!","","","","the realtek audio issue has resolved after updating to epp client 6.2.4.2.
