"500Qk00000CMvdSIAT","00413215","Support Ticket","File shadowing not working when DPI enabled","Dear Support team,

We are in the process of a POC with Sony, ACV:$156k, facing the following issue.
When DPI is turned on and shadowing as well, the sensitive files get blocked BUT do not get shadowed.

This issue is due to the fact that the background discovery thread does not activate until after the file block event is sent to the server.
File scanning and blocked:
06-26 11:18:25.006 1648 DEBUG  The policy 'test policy shadow' was satisfied by threshold [cf::PoliciesScanStatus::setPolThresholdIsMet <a href='https://PolicyScanStatus.cpp' target='_blank'>PolicyScanStatus.cpp</a>:138]

 While Background discovery:
06-26 11:18:25.008 21244 INFO   Starting the background discovery thread! [scan_persist::PersistentScanCache::pushBackgroundScanLocationJob <a href='https://PersistentScanCache.cpp' target='_blank'>PersistentScanCache.cpp</a>:1247]
06-26 11:18:25.008 11084 INFO   scanning location: 'C:UsersAPSISCRLT-5730Desktop' [scan_persist::PersistentScanCache::backgroundScan <a href='https://PersistentScanCache.cpp' target='_blank'>PersistentScanCache.cpp</a>:891]

Immediately after the file gets blocked, the background scan starts. 
On my computer, whenever i do this, the backgound scan starts before the file gets blocked. 
After speaking to sales, this seems to be a frequent issue that is encountered, so  I would like to open this ticket to submit as an improvement request to the above mentioned behavior.

Can you please add me as a watcher or @ me on the resulting ADO ticket?

Thank you,
