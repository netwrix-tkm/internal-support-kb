I have 2 of these and each one is not being recognised and will not mount as read only and wont mount at all
Please can you categorise it as as USB or white list as read-only . I spoke with Arpitha and she informed me some devices are not recognised by EPP
test machine i was working on in test env MACFVFDV5QMQ05P
Troubleshooting: I managed to find an old samsung usb, format it as exfat and that mounts fine as read only so it isnt a problem with the client machine etc","","The customer wants to deploy easylock on a device with multiple partitions which is not supported","I asked for a workaround if possible","EasyLock can not be deployed on Storage devices with multiple partitions.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","149.0","Closed - Resolved","ServiceNow","Swaroop Tiyyagura","2024-10-22T16:55:21.000Z","2025-03-20T15:44:49.000Z"
