When a user goes home or roams between Aps they end up with a 169.254 address 

We have done extensive troubleshooting on the wireless adaptor and on the policies on the laptop to no avail, 

This morning the issue affected my laptop at home, we uninstalled endpoint protector as a test and reconnected to Wi-Fi which picked up the correct IP address and connected to the internet straight away, 

We have some records of this issue back in November/October but there was no trend then so it could have been isolated events, 

We identified it as a definite issue in January, however we suspect it was going on before then, 

Can you have a look at EPP policies and see if anything was changed that could be affecting this please ?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-25T14:00:28.000Z"
