@WaitingOnEngineer

I suppose the issue here is that the customer can't actually build apps using Xcode, am I right?Â  I've checked the logged file. There are over 14.000 file scans in it. And it seems that almost all of them are rsync related. So, what's happening? The user is building apps with Xcode. And in this process, rsync is used to copy files from one location to another (the files that are built/generated are the ones copied). If rsync is checked in the policy (and it is, because I decrypted the database with the policies and found it there) what would the customer expect the EPP client do when rsync is accessing a file and tries to copy it in another location? Please ask them. I will also tell you what is expected to happen. The EPP client has to scan the file. And if there is any confidential content in it, it will be blocked. So, the file copy will fail. And eventually probably the build as well.

""The customer is requesting an investigation into why after upgrading the OS version, they are having this issue since this is their main tool.""

Not saying this is again the case but with this particular customer it happened a few times that what they are saying is not actually true. I don't know why previously they did not have the issue. Maybe they changed something in the projects? Did they use rsync before as well? Are we sure they always had rsync in the CAP policies? But again, it doesn't even matter that much. We are currently presented a situation which is 100% normal, expected. So let's not waste time anymore, tell the customer to disable rsync in the CAP policies. At least for the developers ðŸ˜Š You can say this to the customer, but it's insane to monitor rsync actions for a developer.Â
