My colleagues from the dev team are currently working on an Offline Client Patch that can be installed and will contain the EPP clients with the fix. This is not ready however and as an alternative MDM tools can be used to deploy the EPP clients with the fix.

I will attach instructions for the 2 MDM's we currently have guides for the EPP client deployment.

JAMF: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_User_Manual_EN.pdf 
Intune: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_Intune_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

Change IP script for JAMF deployment: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_files/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

EPP clients containing the fix:
macOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Please let me know if there is any other information that I can provide.

Thank you. Do you have instructions for Kandji MDM? can you please clarify
if this needs to replace the current installation file in our MDM that are
being distributed to new clients? I'd be happy to hop on a quick call if
possible.

Unfortunately we do not have instructions for Kandji, but I think it is similar to JAMF for which we have instructions.

The installer file(based on the OS) should be replaced in the MDM. I will link them below:
macOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

If you would like we can schedule a quick call for tomorrow to further discuss this.

We have received an update from our colleagues regarding the new Hotfix. It should now be available.

Please let me know if you have availability today or Monday for a quick remote session so we can apply the hotfix together.

Regarding the EPP clients, from what was investigated so far the issue was with the initial EPP server side hotfix, which was resolved by applying the new Hotfix 1.1. The clients provided last week for the initial hotfix should be working correctly as the issue did not affect them.
