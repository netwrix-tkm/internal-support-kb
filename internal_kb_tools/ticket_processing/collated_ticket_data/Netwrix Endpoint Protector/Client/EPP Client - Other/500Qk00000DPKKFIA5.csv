"500Qk00000DPKKFIA5","00415689","Support Ticket","Third party applications not working after re-installing latest EPP version","With new EPP version, I am having issues with using a few applications. We are testing the new endpoint version on a few test machines and found similar issues.

Taking example of one of the application, the software center client never starts on my local machine and event log shows as per attached files. 
 
These applications are working with old versions of EPP client, so not really sure what's happening. Can we setup a troubleshooting call to review this?

I am available Tuesday 10:30AM MST or Wednesday between 9-11 AM MST
