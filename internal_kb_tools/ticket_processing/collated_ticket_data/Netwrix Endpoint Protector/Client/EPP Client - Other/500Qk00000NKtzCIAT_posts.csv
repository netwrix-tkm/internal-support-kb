I am currently using EndpointProtector and have installed the EndpointProtector Client on Ubuntu 24.04 running through WSL in a Windows environment.

I need to retrieve the policy from the server, but instead of relying on automatic policy updates, I am looking for a command that allows me to manually update the policy via CLI.

Could you confirm if such a command exists? If so, please provide the exact command for this process.

Thank you.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T02:27:43.000Z"
