Here are the answers that I received from the engineers:
1. When the following command is executed: curl --upload-file <a href='https://file.zip' target='_blank'>file.zip</a> <a href='https://transfer.sh/file.zip' target='_blank'>https://transfer.sh/file.zip</a>
Yes (using DPI) and monitoring the curl application

2. Through a custom file server using SOCKS5
Not sure if this will work, but you can try to monitor the port of the SOCKS5 proxy using DPI and check if it works as expected
To monitor the port you will have to access Content Aware Protection -> Deep Packet Inspection -> and enable the Custom Ports.

3. RDP channels
No

4: SSH tunnels
No

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,

Thanks for your reply.

However, I noticed that the SSH option is enabled in the EPP, even though you mentioned that the tool doesn't support SSH Tunnel.

Can you please clarify this?
