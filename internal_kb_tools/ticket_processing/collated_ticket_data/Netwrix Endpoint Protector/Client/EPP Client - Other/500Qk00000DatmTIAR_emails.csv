Hello Serhat,

I got an update from the engineers, they told me hat the pop-ups are related to DPI bypass and that the events should be logged in the EPP server also.
The event when the user tried to access https://bam.eu01.nr-data.net did not happen when the logs were collected, so the engineer could not see it in the client logs.
But, as long as the notification was displayed by the EPP Client, there should also be an ""event log"" associated to it, which can be found in the Content Aware Reports.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Serhat,

I am reaching out to you on this ticket with the note that the shared logs are still under investigation with our R&D team.
We will keep you posted on the progress as soon as we will have an update.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Serhat,

Together with Emil we had a sync with Netwrix team administrating the Support Portal. 
They confirmed that this is the designed behavior for files uploaded on tickets: once files are uploaded the user that created the ticket cannot access those files, only visualize the name of uploaded files.

Concerning the attachments that were not visible from the start/ with the first upload for Emil, the team will be looking into this to understand if it's a one time occurrence or if it's happening in particular cases and understand what may cause this.

Best regards,

Oana

Hi Emil,
 

There is probably something wrong with the support portal, because I see the attachment names in the ticket. 

I uploaded the files again.

 

@Oana Nemes Since we cannot download the attachments, we don't know if the upload is successful or not. Why cannot we download the very attachments we upload?

 

Thanks,

-serhat
