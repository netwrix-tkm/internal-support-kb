We are working on a policy that would report if somebody uploads files to a specific Sharepoint. We have our policy set to report only, however the Sharepoint website is getting blocked entirely by EPP. We are using DPI so not sure if is causing the issues. Thank you!","","6/2/2025

- Customer was attempting to use a policy that contained a sharepoint URL in deny list. 
- Customer thought since policy was set to report only that URL would report if users attempted to visit site not block site
- Remote session held towards enabling EPP to attempt to track users attempts by removing URL from deny list and placing URL under URL categories
- Customer was unsuccessful in receiving CAP reports from attempts to upload files to sharepoint.
- Customer in the process of testing URL categories to see if policy issues a report when attempts to upload content is made.","Awaiting customer","- Created a test policy for a test computer and put a policy denylist for sharepoint, with DPI sharepoint gets blocked yet DPI not enabled sharepoint does not get blocked.
