"500Qk00000NoFl0IAF","00441254","Support Ticket","Need information on Offline Devices","Hi All (Andrei),

We are having some issues where we have a lot of machines that are currently showing as Offline and I cannot work out how to get them back Online.
Or where the configuration issue might be for all of these machines that are Offline.

I was testing an issue with other Offline machines, and I Deleted a Computer (that was showing as Online) out of Device Control > Computers.
This successfully removed the Computer from the list, and then when that Computer was rebooted, it populated into the list of Computers again. 
But it has not come back Online in over an hour.

I believe we may have a bunch of other machines that are suffering from the same issue, they have the agent installed, and showing updated times on the agent. 
However, any changes that were made for those machines to access devices, have not worked. OTPâ€™s have not worked.

I am aware there is some form of Visualisation Bug in the Computer display area of Device Control, but this seems to be more than that.
On that note, that bug does make it incredibly hard to understand what is actually wrong in our environment, so if there is any troubleshooting or fixes for that bug, that would be appreciated to know.

I could not find anything online that explicitly states what is required for the Devices to appear as Online, if you have anything I can follow that would be appreciated.
Otherwise lets organise a call for tomorrow if possible?

Kind Regards,
Finn
