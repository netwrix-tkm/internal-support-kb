Customer name is RubyPlay.
Could you please look into the possibility of checking if the macOS EPP Network extension is enabled/disabled on the endpoint?
We know that currently EPP has a function to provide some action if the Network extension is disabled, but it would be really helpful if customer will be able to see on which macOS computers this extension wasn't allowed.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-11T09:33:47.000Z"

For Endpoint Protector it will show ""activated"" and ""enabled"" when the extension is installed and enabled.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-02-13T13:46:56.000Z"
