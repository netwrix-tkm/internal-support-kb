@WaitingOnEngineer

It's pretty hard to look for the cause of an issue as long as we don't know what the issue is. 

Can the customer tell us exactly how many devices are affected? Also, related to the first issue that was mentioned, the one that was fixed with an EPP client restart. Did the issue surface again? Or it was a one time only issue? Theoretically the EPP client doesn't have anything to do with the driver itself, the description suggests more that there was an issue with an improper Bluetooth driver. It's true, it might be than when the EPP client started, it enabled the BT device. Even though it seems that the BT devices are allowed, so the EPP client should not block them. Is it possible that at some point (more or less recently) they had Bt devices blocked and enabled them later? I am asking this related to the second example also. I checked the logs there, I don't see anything suspicios. There is only a trace of some BT AirPods that were connected last time around 2 weeks ago and at that time it seems that the right set on them was Deny. 

So I think you should gather more details about the issues the customer is facing and get some new logs. Since they have an old build (June 2012) we recommend testing with a more recent version, for example the new RC test build for 5941: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_10_21EPPClient_v6.2.4.1001  In the last two years there were a couple of BT improvements for Windows, mainly related to how EPP detects BT devices, so this newer build might help if they are still facing issues. 

They should enable at install the option ""Increased communication security"". As for the other customizations they are using, the one with ""certificate at register"" is enabled by default in the code. They were also using the message box notifications, but I see this was implemented in 2020 as a setting, so the server they are using should have that.

On the machine we looked at, the state before we disabled EPPService.exe was that in Device Manager, ""Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)"" had a bang on it and the BT peripherals weren't working.  Disable/re-enable the Intel device put it back to the error state.  Stopped EPP, then again disabled/re-enabled and the Intel device went to a normal working state.

The customers asked for an RCA for this issue.
Are the logs that we currently have enough in order to find the root cause of this issue? 
Regarding the test agent, I could not schedule a meeting in order to install it and test if the issue can be reproduced with it.

@WaitingOnEngineer

There is no mention but I suppose the screenshot attached is from the first issue, the one that was fixed after a client restart (together with disable/enable of the BT driver). And you mentioned that the issue did not reproduce anymore. We can't have an RCA for this issue, as long as we received only a Screenshot (the logs were from a different machine, where we don't know yet what the issue was, no?). I can't say more except for what I said the first time. There might have been some sort of a glitch with that BT driver and I can't say 100% sure that EPP had nothing to do with that, but I can't say more with the info that I have.

Just a curiosity, the customer is using the same EPP client for more than 2 years now. Any chance they mentioned what changed recently, since the issues popped-up? Did they change anything in the settings? Maybe played with the BT rights? As mentioned before, if they still encounter issues, we need some logs ideally with the newer client and some details about what's happening exactly. Thanks!
