Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi,

I went as far as I can go with this version on the clients. Do we have to upgrade the appliance again?

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

Thank you,

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate, if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in
advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close
this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one
of my colleagues will assist you.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the
client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the
clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a

Hi Philip,

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

Thank you,

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate, if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Hi Eduard,

I am trying to download client software and the only option is 6.0. Where can I get the 5.9 to manually install on a fresh laptop?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

No worries, just want to understand your need and help you accordingly.
But you can safely install 6.0.x.x on any computer.

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Hi Eduard,

I am trying to download client software and the only option is 6.0. Where can I get the 5.9 to manually install on a fresh laptop?

Hi Philip,

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.

Hey Philip,

No worries, just want to understand your need and help you accordingly.
But you can safely install 6.0.x.x on any computer.

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why
you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so
they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in
advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close
this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one
of my colleagues will assist you.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the
client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the
clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Hi Philip,

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

I am trying to download client software and the only option is 6.0. Where
can I get the 5.9 to manually install on a fresh laptop?

Hi Philip,

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so
they should not match.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the
clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information and see the disk space usage there.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot
from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console
stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information
and see the disk space usage there.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information and see the disk space usage there.

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate, if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot
from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console
stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information
and see the disk space usage there.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot
from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console
stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information
and see the disk space usage there.

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why
you prefer installing an older version?

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot
from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console
stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information
and see the disk space usage there.

Ok, I did the update to the appliance and looked to see if there were any
further updates to clients, and there are not. The only item left is that
epp server hotfix . The system status shows an HDD Disk space issue, and
system backup is not set. Please see screenshot

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why
you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi,

I went as far as I can go with this version on the clients. Do we have to
upgrade the appliance again?

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

Thank you,

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Thank you,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the
client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the
clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information and see the disk space usage there.

Thank you,

Ok, I did the update to the appliance and looked to see if there were any further updates to clients, and there are not. The only item left is that epp server hotfix . The system status shows an HDD Disk space issue, and system backup is not set. Please see screenshot

Hey Philip,

Please take a snaphot of the VM and you can go ahead and upgrade only the Functionality Product Updates.
Once you are done, Upgrade the clients also.
Let me know if you want to set up a meeting for assistance.

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.

OK, so then I would like to upgrade the appliance- can you assist?

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate, if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see what the issue is.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information and see the disk space usage there.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot
from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console
stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information
and see the disk space usage there.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also
set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a
security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality
upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server
version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a
security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and
go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply
UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page
and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System
Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the
agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times.
And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me
know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading
just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade
the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed
the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server
with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4
times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server
version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer
to continue from here on.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need
to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many
tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed
attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you
can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create
the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my
colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server
stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last
rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older
server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not
know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can
accurately answer it.

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet
Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown,
but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for
restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it
again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer
received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all
computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I
will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the
server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we
have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content
aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest
version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these
to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that
best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate,
if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

Let's schedule the meeting and you can present what is going on so we can
find a solution. Not sure how else we could troubleshoot since I need to see
what the issue is.

Thank you,

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need
to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a
remote session to look into this.

Thank you,

Hey Philip,

There should be no hotfix to apply anymore. Can you send me a screenshot from the live upgrade page?
The HDD is red because it is turned off, and that is by default.
If you have issues you will see a yellow banner at the top of the console stating that fact. To be sure you can go to Appliance -> Server Information and see the disk space usage there.

Hey Philip,

The 6.0.x.x version is more than suitable for install. Is there a reason why you prefer installing an older version?

Yes that is okay. The agent and server version numbers are not related, so they should not match.

Hi Philip,

I can do both, I can send you a detailed guide, and if you want we can also set up another remote session and go through the steps.
From this server version you should see two updates and one of those is a security vulnerability hotfix. We will only use the product functionality upgrades and we can ignore the hotfix since it is contained in server version 5.9.4.0 which is the second-to-last upgrade.

Before upgrading, please make sure you have a snapshot of the VM taken as a security measure in case something happens during the upgrade process.
To upgrade the server using the online option, log into the Web console and go to Dashboard -> Live Update, and click on Check now

After that please select the Product Functionality Update and press Apply UpdatesAfter the update was applied successfully you can refresh the page and the patching is complete.

Keep repeating the process four times, and then you can go to System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade and start a new upgrade job for the agent to the latest version.

Once the agents are upgraded, you can redo the above steps four more times. And so on until there are no more updates found.
If you need us to set up a meeting and go through the steps, just let me know your availability and we can do that.
Please remember to always have a snapshot created before you start upgrading just in case.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Philip,

Since we have to use the client upgrade feature from the console to upgrade the agent, we need to do it in steps of four versions so as not to exceed the feature's five-version limit.
We need to do this process at least two more times to be up to date.
Alternatively, you can create a new snapshot and then upgrade the server with the functionality upgrade and not the hotfix, but not more than 4 times, then create the upgrade jobs until all agents are upgraded.
Repeat the steps, snapshot included, until you are up to date with server version 5.9.4.1
Let me know if you want me to set a meeting for the upgrade or if you prefer to continue from here on.

Hi Philip,

For the ones that failed, it might be due to connectivity issues, so we need to create a new upgrade job after this one finishes. I am not sure how many tries there are to reach the computer before it is considered a failed attempt.
The current job has to be finished because it needs to be deleted before you can select the computers in a new job.
Let me know if you want us to set a meeting for that, or if you can create the upgrading job yourself.
Also letting you know that I will be on leave next week, but one of my colleagues can take over for me until I return.

No, the agents will not realize the server is updating. even if the server stops for days, the clients will not be aware as they enforce the last rights and policies synced.
I recommend creating a snapshot before we proceed just for safety.
You should receive the invite shortly.

Hey Philip,

Of course, just let me know when you want to do that at least a day in advance so we can book the timeslot.
If you want to wait a few weeks before you upgrade, I would like to close this ticket, and when the time comes, you can open a new ticket and I or one of my colleagues will assist you.

Hi Philip,

The server and agents are backward compatible, so you can have an older server but a newer client, or an older client and a newer server.
The issue with this, is if there are new features, the older one will not know about them so they won't be used.
If I misunderstood your question, please provide more details so I can accurately answer it.

Thank you,

Hi Edward,

We did not have many computers that had the issue after we pushed out the client. So if I upgrade the appliance will there be any issues with the clients prior to me pusheing them out?

Hi Philip,

During our meeting, I saw that the certificate we use for Deep Packet Inspection did not refresh on the computers. The reason is still unknown, but the certificate is used by our local proxy to check all packets for restricted content that might leave the internal network.
As a fix, if we uninstall the agent using the zap tool and then install it again after a reboot, everything is in working order, and the computer received the new certificate from the server.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate and get the latest available agent, and I will wait for the outcome on this one.
After this situation is resolved, my recommendation is to also upgrade the server from version 5.6.0.0 to version 5.9.4.1, which is the latest one we have. There are a lot of improved and new features added to our content aware feature. This also means having to upgrade the agents to the latest version, be it a manual install, using an MDM tool, or GPO.
You mentioned that you will get back to me after you manage to present these to the customer, and I will send you information about GPO deployment.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Philip,

I sent you a Timetrade invite earlier. Just open it and select the time that best suits you.
I will also need you to show me where you can see the expired certificate, if that is on a computer, then we will need access to a computer too.

Hi Philip,

I believe that is the certificate for the web console, so there is no need to uninstall any agents since they are not affected by it.
Let me send you my calendar for today and you can choose a time to have a remote session to look into this.
