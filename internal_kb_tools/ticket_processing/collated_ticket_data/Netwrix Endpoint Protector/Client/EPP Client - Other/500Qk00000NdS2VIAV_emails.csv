As part of Netwrix's strategy and commitment to providing solutions with the highest security standards, we have updated the cryptography components in EPP Clients with the 5.9.4.1 release. As a result, support for Windows XP, 7, 8, early builds of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 has been discontinued. Initially, this was not planned, but due to the lack of standard support and fixes from Microsoft for these operating systems and cryptography engines, we cannot offer new EPP Clients for them.
To maintain EPP coverage on these systems, customers should continue using EPP Client version 5.9.4.0. Please note that no new features or fixes will be backported to this release.

Hello,

As part of Netwrix's strategy and commitment to providing solutions with the highest security standards, we have updated the cryptography components in EPP Clients with the 5.9.4.1 release. As a result, support for Windows XP, 7, 8, early builds of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016 has been discontinued. Initially, this was not planned, but due to the lack of standard support and fixes from Microsoft for these operating systems and cryptography engines, we cannot offer new EPP Clients for them.
To maintain EPP coverage on these systems, customers should continue using EPP Client version 5.9.4.0. Please note that no new features or fixes will be backported to this release.
