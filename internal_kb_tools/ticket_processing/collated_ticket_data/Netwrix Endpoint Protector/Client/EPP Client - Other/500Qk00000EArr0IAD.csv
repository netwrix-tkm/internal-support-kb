"500Qk00000EArr0IAD","00417562","Support Ticket","Issue with Azure Directory Admin Center (DSAC)","We are experiencing an issue with the Azure Directory Admin Center. EPP is blocking the application. We have experienced this issue in the past, and we added <a href='https://dsac.exe' target='_blank'>dsac.exe</a> to the Advanced Scanning Exceptions list. After the newest server and client upgrade, the exception is not working. I tried to remove the exception and add it again, but it is still an issue. We downgraded the client version, and the issue was not resolved. This is a high priority because it is preventing our admins from doing their jobs.","","","","mtp scanning was blocking the apps","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","11.0","Closed - Resolved","Ingevity","Jody Mullinax","2024-08-08T13:04:46.000Z","2024-08-19T14:05:24.000Z"
