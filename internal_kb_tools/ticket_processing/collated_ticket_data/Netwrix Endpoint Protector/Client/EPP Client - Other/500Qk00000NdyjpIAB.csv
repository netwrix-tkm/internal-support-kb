Writing to let you know that we are getting an error message as ""Low Disk Space"".","","10/04/2025
Connected remote to assist the client with freeing up the space.
Went on and removed the shadows.
From 95% , the occupying space went down to 40.
We deleted only shadows older than 60 days.
Client was satisfied with the fix.

Client reported that the issue came back and wants to set up another remote session.

Client did not make a snapshot of his VM therefore we could not carry on with the troubleshooting.
Asked to investigate this on their side and let us know once it's done.

Connected remote along with Adrian to take a look at the problem.
This time on his server about 94% of the root was occupied by 34 GB file.
Went on, removed it and client went back to just 14% being used.

Connected remote along with Adrian to sort the issue.
This time, the occupied storage was inside the log /usr , not the shadows.
Went on and removed the unnecessary files that had around 48 GB  and also removed the banner that kept coming up.
Agreed to close the case.","Agreed to close the case.","Issue solved after removing the log file which occupied 95% of the /usr folder.","Database Configuration/Capacity","Marian Ilies","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","48.1","Closed - Resolved","Volksoft Consulting Pvt.
