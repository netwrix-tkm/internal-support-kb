Thank you for contacting our Support Department.

Those buttons are a second way to verify that the newest rights and settings are sent when the client is communicating with the server. 
This are old ways of verifying the communication, since we are already doing it from the refresh time interval setting.

The setting can be found in the Device control menu, under the Global Settings. 

Should you require further details or additional information, please let us know.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
