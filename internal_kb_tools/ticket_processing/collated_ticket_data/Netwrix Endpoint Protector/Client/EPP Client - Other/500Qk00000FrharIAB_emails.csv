Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team,

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy:


  1.  askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage
  2.  dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login
  3.  whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team, 

  

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy: 

  


	askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage 
	dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login 
	whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access 


  

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team, 

  

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy: 

  


	askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage 
	dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login 
	whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access 


  

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team,

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy:


  1.  askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage
  2.  dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login
  3.  whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team, 

  

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy: 

  


	askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage 
	dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login 
	whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access 


  

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Hello,

Yes, reprovision.db is included in the debug log but it needs to be taken axactly when the issue is happening. So we know exactly what is applying when the issue happens.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hi Team,

Pertaining to the changes which you suggested, we observed the below issues in the normal policy:


  1.  askit.jmbaxi.com/app/itdesk/HomePAge.do - unable to interact with certain functions in the webpage
  2.  dash.cloudflare.com/login - unable to verify captcha as it kept loading and unable to bypass the login
  3.  whatsapp web, skype web and personal gmail is able to access

None of the above websites have Netwrix certificate in their browser, attached is a sample from whatsapp website. It is the same for the rest of the URLs mentioned above.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Does this happen on different browsers?
Can you also try to enable the Stealthy DPI driver on the computer settings, update the policies and restart the computer to see if the issue remains.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download  https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team, 

  

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Yes, as per I checked, the DPI settings of that particular device and the global DPI settings are configured the same. No changes were made. The issues still persists.

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vU3VwcG9ydF9maWxlcy9zdXBwb3J0X3Rvb2wvU3VwcG9ydFRvb2xfd2luLnppcA==&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=Wit3VFNKVTFqNnY2emxuL1o2ZkV6YXlEcEtqVldKUWx4RWhVWkVmZjJ2cz0=&h=1b451aba6a864420a152c1bf79d048ba&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=endpointprotector.com&u=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3dubG9hZC5lbmRwb2ludHByb3RlY3Rvci5jb20vU3VwcG9ydF9maWxlcy9lcHBfY29sbGVjdF9kcGlfdG9vbC56aXA=&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=MENhQmx5STJ0cHR4US82QlZMbGNtck9GZThid1V2ZXZSUkhYSEVab09VTT0=&h=1b451aba6a864420a152c1bf79d048ba&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVbXGxHoidkgmstrHEF2BF3bzZYNVuyXh0Hsqsb3UeLc9g>

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Yes, as per I checked, the DPI settings of that particular device and the global DPI settings are configured the same. No changes were made. The issues still persists.

Dear Team,

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Kind regards

Can you also try to enable the Stealthy DPI driver on the computer settings, update the policies and restart the computer to see if the issue remains.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,

 

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning
properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working
automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received
a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and
help stabilize the DLP environment.

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards

Satish Patil

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team,

 

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

You don't often get email from satishp@diabos.biz. Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards

Satish Patil

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,



The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Netwrix Team,

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working.
The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier.


  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.
  2.  Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix.

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently.
I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one.
Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=whatsapp.com&u=aHR0cDovL3doYXRzYXBwLmNvbQ==&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=V0xzZUpiTVRycVBSLzhZbE1VRGhnWmZqVnBSRlYrRmxPQ1NrKzY3bmpGQT0=&h=7e44b087903749abaada642b18fc5915&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVavUr0Lu5XKc642ZlOI2576OhRaYQDaAPCxvUD73ctstA>"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Best regards,

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.
Thanks & Regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Hello,

Dear Team,



The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  


	Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. 
	Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 


  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 



I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.


Thanks & Regards

6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team,

 

The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello Sidharth,

We completely understand that it's frustrating when policies don't seem to apply as expected. We want to resolve this as efficiently as possible for J M BAXI GROUP and also for Satcom Infotech.
From our experience, when multiple issues are grouped into one report/ ticket it may slow down resolutions because different teams may need to investigate different aspects. If we separate each specific symptom or issue into its own ticket, we can ensure that the right experts address them simultaneously rather then sequentially - think  of it like a doctor's visit: if you come in saying you feel unwell, they'll ask about each symptom separately to get to the root cause faster/ direct you to the right specialist/s. The same applies here - by braking things down, we can diagnose and fix each issue more efficiently.

The support team already asked for availability to look at both issues that you described earlier (and that are independent from the .whatsapp.com related issue that was confirmed solved) - this time we'll keep these both into the current ticket, but moving further, may we agree to get each issue reported into a dedicated ticket?

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Oana

Dear Netwrix Team,



As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working.

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier.



  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.
  2.  Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix.



The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently.

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one.

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards

Satish Patil

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,



The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Hello,

Can we schedule a remote connection to check the 2 issues and collect a set of logs?
Please let me know your availability for this week.

  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Frhar:ref


Dear Netwrix Team,

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working.
The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier.


  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.
  2.  Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix.

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren't. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently.
I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one.
Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Yes, as per I checked, the DPI settings of that particular device and the global DPI settings are configured the same. No changes were made. The issues still persists.

Dear Team,



The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Ma’am,

We can approach the issue as per your suggestion. We can address each issues separately with individual ticket, but I would also request you to consider the intermittent behaviour of the policy to also be approached as an issue as well since that is a common factor between all the policy issues that the customer is currently facing.

Hello Sidharth,

We completely understand that it's frustrating when policies don't seem to apply as expected. We want to resolve this as efficiently as possible for J M BAXI GROUP and also for Satcom Infotech.
From our experience, when multiple issues are grouped into one report/ ticket it may slow down resolutions because different teams may need to investigate different aspects. If we separate each specific symptom or issue into its own ticket, we can ensure that the right experts address them simultaneously rather then sequentially - think  of it like a doctor's visit: if you come in saying you feel unwell, they'll ask about each symptom separately to get to the root cause faster/ direct you to the right specialist/s. The same applies here - by braking things down, we can diagnose and fix each issue more efficiently.

The support team already asked for availability to look at both issues that you described earlier (and that are independent from the .whatsapp.com related issue that was confirmed solved) - this time we'll keep these both into the current ticket, but moving further, may we agree to get each issue reported into a dedicated ticket?

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Oana

Dear Netwrix Team,



As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working.

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier.



  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.
  2.  Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix.



The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently.

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one.

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=whatsapp.com&u=aHR0cDovL3doYXRzYXBwLmNvbQ==&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=V0xzZUpiTVRycVBSLzhZbE1VRGhnWmZqVnBSRlYrRmxPQ1NrKzY3bmpGQT0=&h=7e44b087903749abaada642b18fc5915&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVavUr0Lu5XKc642ZlOI2576OhRaYQDaAPCxvUD73ctstA>"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Best regards,

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Team,



The customer is once again facing the issue with their cloudflare website which they had reported earlier and you had helped us resolve it during our previous session. The customer has reported the issue once again hence proving that the policy is behaving inconsistently on the customer network. Kindly look into the same as well.

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  


	Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. 
	Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 


  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 



I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.


Thanks & Regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #421220 - - 00421220 - Intermittent disabling of policy [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Frhar:ref ]

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Frhar:ref


Dear Netwrix Team,

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working.
The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier.


  1.  Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail.
  2.  Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix.

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren't. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently.
I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one.
Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating.

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com<https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com?d=whatsapp.com&u=aHR0cDovL3doYXRzYXBwLmNvbQ==&p=m&i=NjZjYzJjOTYzOTlhMzMwYjA2MDU2ZGFm&t=V0xzZUpiTVRycVBSLzhZbE1VRGhnWmZqVnBSRlYrRmxPQ1NrKzY3bmpGQT0=&h=7e44b087903749abaada642b18fc5915&s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVavUr0Lu5XKc642ZlOI2576OhRaYQDaAPCxvUD73ctstA>"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this.

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.
Thanks & Regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Yes, as per I checked, the DPI settings of that particular device and the global DPI settings are configured the same. No changes were made. The issues still persists.

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  


	Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. 
	Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 


  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 



I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.


Thanks & Regards

This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  


	Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. 
	Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 


  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 



I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.


Thanks & Regards

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

If the setting we added does not help in this case does not help you can try to apply the Cloudflare allowlist we created.
Or you can enable the other DPI bypass options to see if it works.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
For Personal gmail logging, we removed *google.com* from the allowlist.
For Cloudflare we enabled the ""Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirement"" option. (We also enabled it globally)

As you mentioned you will test and monitor this then get back with an email.

Kind regards

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  


	Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. 
	Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 


  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 



I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.


Thanks & Regards

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

>>
>> I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of

>> Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported

Dear Team,

We applied Cloudflare to the allowlist, and now the URL is working fine.

Hello,

If the setting we added does not help in this case does not help you can try to apply the Cloudflare allowlist we created.
Or you can enable the other DPI bypass options to see if it works.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
For Personal gmail logging, we removed *google.com* from the allowlist.
For Cloudflare we enabled the ""Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirement"" option. (We also enabled it globally)

As you mentioned you will test and monitor this then get back with an email.

Kind regards

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  

Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 

  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards 

Satish Patil

Hello,

If possible the extended DPI logs would help. If not we will recheck the previous logs.

Hello,

We din not find any conclusive issue on the previous logs.
Can you please collect a new set of logs from a computer?
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access the webpages that should have been blocked.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Also please run the extended log file for the DPI.
1. download https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/epp_collect_dpi_tool.zip
2. Run the .bat file
3. The extended log should be on the desktop.

Kind regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Kind regards

Dear Netwrix Team,

We are implementing the latest version of DLP in our system and testing both the normal user policy and HOD policy. Please allow this week for testing; if all policies work as expected, we will update you and close the case next week.

Thanks & Regards

Dear Team,

We applied Cloudflare to the allowlist, and now the URL is working fine.

Hello,

If the setting we added does not help in this case does not help you can try to apply the Cloudflare allowlist we created.
Or you can enable the other DPI bypass options to see if it works.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
For Personal gmail logging, we removed *google.com* from the allowlist.
For Cloudflare we enabled the ""Bypass on HTTP Errors Indicating mTLS Requirement"" option. (We also enabled it globally)

As you mentioned you will test and monitor this then get back with an email.

Kind regards

Dear Netwrix Team, 

  

As per your suggestion, we have removed the whatsapp and skype from allowlist and it is working. 

The customer, is also facing issues with the below points as discussed earlier. 

  

Personal gmail is logging in even though protection policy is applied to block personal logins in gmail. Cloudflare getting blocked due to Netwrix. 

  

The issue reported by the customer mentions that the policy are intermittently getting disabled. Hence the policies are sometimes working as expected and sometimes aren’t. There is also a few more issues which customer has reported as getting disabled intermittently. 

I request you to check the actual issue holistically instead of addressing each issues one by one. 

Since the logs we send every time while recreating the issue is reported as having no logs indicating the same, is it possible for your engineer to collect log themselves while the issue is recreated.

Dear Satish, 

I appreciate you taking the time to share your concerns, and I completely understand how frustrating this situation must be for you and your team. Ensuring that you can fully utilize Endpoint Protector is our top priority, and we regret that this has been a prolonged and challenging experience.

I want to acknowledge the efforts our support team has put in over the past months to assist with the different issues that arose, working closely with your team and Satcom Infotech team to troubleshoot and resolve them. I also recognize that despite the efforts, the challenges have persisted, which is understandably frustrating. 

Regarding the latest issue, we're currently awaiting the confirmation from your team if ""*.whatsapp.com"" is part of both a denylist and an allowlist (as this is showing up in the last set of logs received from your team) and the conclusion after removing it from the allowlist. Furthermore, it would help us understand exactly what other solutions are part of your technology stack (VPN, antivirus, Secure Web Gateways). Sharing with us the exact names of these solutions would be extremely helpful.

Your experience matters to us, and we truly appreciate your patience and partnership as we work through this. 

Best regards,

Oana Nemes

Dear Team,

We have implemented DLP almost 8 to 9 months ago, but it is not functioning properly. We are facing daily issues, with policies not working automatically. Despite sharing the logs 4 to 5 times, we have not received a proper solution. I kindly request you to provide a stable solution and help stabilize the DLP environment.

Thanks & Regards

Hello,

Can you please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces.
 We need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment before the issue resolves.
The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

Dear Team,

We are in the process of implementing the latest DLP system for 70 users.
Out of these, 58 users have applied the Normal Policy, while 12 users have
applied the HOD Policy. Both policies are currently functioning as expected.

If any issues arise, I will log a call with you for further assistance.
Therefore, I kindly request you to close the ticket.
Thanks & Regards
