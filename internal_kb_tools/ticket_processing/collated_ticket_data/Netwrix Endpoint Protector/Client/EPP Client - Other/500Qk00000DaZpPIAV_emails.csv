Hello Serhat,

Here is a download link for a test build which addresses this issue:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp19082024/EPPClient_v6.2.3.0052.zip

The issue was caused by the third-party library libevent that we were using in our Deep Packet Inspection module. It was creating the temporary files that were never cleaned up.We determined the problem was in code that uses the Windows 10 feature for Unix domain sockets. Our fix involved recompiling the libevent library without support for Unix domain sockets for Windows.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

This issue was reported by the same user with the Err_connection_closed issue. I am uploading the diagnostics from that machine with the same screenshot for the file names.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416233 - EPP writes every ~10 seconds a 0 byte .tpm file in temp directory    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0DaZpP:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","henrique.praxedes@booking.com; serhat.demir@booking.com","oana.nemes@netwrix.com","adrian.draghici@netwrix.com","false","2025-03-11T15:48:53.000Z","true"
