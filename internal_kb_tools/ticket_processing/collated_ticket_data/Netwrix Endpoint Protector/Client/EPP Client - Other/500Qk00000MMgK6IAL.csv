We have noticed that some clients generate logs in the console that are in the future.
e. g. LPTP2063620 (Date/Time (Client): 2055-02-27 07:20:21)
The previous events seem to match and the new ones too, but there is an outlier.
Unfortunately, multiple clients are affected.

Please check and fix it.

Regards
