As a fix, we uninstalled the agent using the zap tool since regular uninstall left some remnants and the new agent would error out, and then install it again after a reboot. This solved the issue with the certificate.
We also started a client upgrade process from the console so that all computers refresh the certificate when they get the latest available agent.","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-01-27T21:14:45.000Z"

before upgrading I will make sure to explain the client upgrade process.
need to start at 5650 offline and continue from there.","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-02-17T20:12:21.000Z"

when that is done we need to upgrade a few more to still be in the range of 5 versions to use the upgrade process form the console.
recommend upgrading to 5910 and upgrading the agents again before moving on","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-02-21T14:38:44.000Z"
