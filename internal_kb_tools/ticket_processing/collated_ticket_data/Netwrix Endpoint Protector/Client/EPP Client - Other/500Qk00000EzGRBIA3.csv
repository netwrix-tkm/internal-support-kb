As per he title of the ticket our Ubuntu 22 agents are experiencing an issue where with DPI turned on phone numbers transferred via <a href='https://dlptest.com' target='_blank'>dlptest.com</a> are not being intercepted and blocked. For other websites like gmail, etc the same file is being blocked. Also other files are blocked on <a href='https://dlptest.com' target='_blank'>dlptest.com</a> it is just specifically INDIAN phone numbers which are not working. In the logs attached, we have uploaded a file called Test_Phone. Please investigate and let us know if there are chances of missing the uploads to other websites as well.","","","","The issue was solved by updating the EPP Client.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","136.1","Closed - Resolved","Naukri","Vaneet Kumar","2024-08-27T13:18:50.000Z","2025-01-10T16:04:50.000Z"
