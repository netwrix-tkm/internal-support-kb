The resolution for this is to add the process ""Outlook"" to the whitelisted applications under ""System Parameters"" > ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"".

	Please enable ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"".
	Add the word ""Outlook"" inside the box for ""Application Process Name"" then click on ""Add to content"".  The message ""Apps successfully added to list!"" will appear.  See below screenshots.

Hi Alin, thanks very much for the speedy reply,

I will test that, but before I do I just wanted to understand the implications fully- does this mean that Outlook can access any device regardless of what overall EPP policy says?

I made sure the EPP policy was refreshed, and that all Outlook processes were killed, is there perhaps a latency time, or might there be something I'm missing?

I'm sad to report that after a restart of the EPP server, and a further bounce of Outlook and client policy refresh, we are still in the same position:

[cid:image001.png@01DB34E2.1BA5B720]

Is there anything else you would like to try, or might a remote session be possible to have a further look into it?   I am available for the next hour, and 1200-1600 GMT, if that would be convenient?

Hi Alin,

That doesn't seem to have worked,
[cid:image001.png@01DB34F6.9782EA20]

I made sure the EPP policy was refreshed, and that all Outlook processes were killed, is there perhaps a latency time, or might there be something I'm missing?

Hello,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

The resolution for this is to add the process ""Outlook"" to the whitelisted applications under ""System Parameters"" > ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"".

  1.  Please enable ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"".
  2.  Add the word ""Outlook"" inside the box for ""Application Process Name"" then click on ""Add to content"".  The message ""Apps successfully added to list!"" will appear.  See below screenshots.
  3.  The process ""Outlook"" will now be listed under ""Whitelisted Applications""
  4.  Select the process name and then click on ""Generate"", the message ""App list successfully uploaded!"" will appear as shown in the last screenshot below.
  5.  Update the polices on the endpoint machine, close Outlook. Open Outlook again and re-test the scenario.

Hi Alin,

That doesn't seem to have worked,
[cid:image001.png@01DB3518.3D4AEF90]

I made sure the EPP policy was refreshed, and that all Outlook processes were killed, is there perhaps a latency time, or might there be something I'm missing?

Warm Regards

Subject: Since going up to EPP 6.2.3.1010 we have lost the ability to print from outlook [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0I9G6P:ref ]

Hello,

Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

The resolution for this is to add the process ""Outlook"" to the whitelisted applications under ""System Parameters"" > ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"".

  1.  Please enable ""Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning:"".
  2.  Add the word ""Outlook"" inside the box for ""Application Process Name"" then click on ""Add to content"".  The message ""Apps successfully added to list!"" will appear.  See below screenshots.
  3.  The process ""Outlook"" will now be listed under ""Whitelisted Applications""
  4.  Select the process name and then click on ""Generate"", the message ""App list successfully uploaded!"" will appear as shown in the last screenshot below.
  5.  Update the polices on the endpoint machine, close Outlook. Open Outlook again and re-test the scenario.
