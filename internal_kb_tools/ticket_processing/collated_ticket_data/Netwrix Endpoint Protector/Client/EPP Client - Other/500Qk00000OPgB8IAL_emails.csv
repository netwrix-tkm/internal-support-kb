Thank you for reaching out.

Regarding your first question, please note that the scanning speed depends on the computer's resources rather than on the server.

For your second question, if you want to scan and report file types that are not included in EPP by default, you can create a Denylist File Name dictionary using the specific file extensions and use it in the eDiscovery policy. For more details, please refer to our documentation here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4.2/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/DenylistsAllowlists/Denylists.htm#file_name

Please let us know if this answers your questions or if you have any further concerns.

Thank you!
