Client installations were completed for one of our customers. Ping communication between the server and clients is successful, and there are no issues with their communication. Changes made to the policies are detected by the clients, and all permissions have been granted. However, the computers appear offline in the panel. What could be the reason for this?

Best Regards.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-19T10:10:44.000Z"
