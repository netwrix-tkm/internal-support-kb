Following our recent Zoom session, we have resolved the issue regarding the missing Content Aware Protection tab for clients after upgrading to version 3.0.4.1006. The resolution involved adding the affected computers to the appropriate policy. With your consent granted during the meeting, I will proceed to close this case.

Please feel free to contact me if you experience any further issues.

Thank you.
