"500Qk00000CPgA1IAL","00413363","Support Ticket","Please kindly provide the offline patch for Hotfix #1 with fixed EPPClients.","Hi Support Team,


We check out the offline patch for Hotfix - ADV-2024-002 - Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities and truly appreciate it so fast. 

However, this Hoffix does not include the fixed EPPClients. It is so hard to deploy the fixed EPPClients, which are able to download seperately, to the big size customers.

Could you kindly provide the offline patch for Hotfix with the fixed EPPClients? 

If so, we can automatically deploy these EPPClients to any customer in the 'System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade' section. It would be so painful or long for our engineers to deploy about 1,000 to 5,000 clients manually. Additionally, if we do not quickly resolve this vulnerability, there is a possibility that government agencies may intervene.

Please understand this situation.

Have a nice day!
Always thank you for your support.


Best Regards,
Jack Jung","","","","Deployed: Hotfix adv-2024-002","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","20.0","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Korea","Support Netwrix","2024-06-28T04:06:28.000Z","2024-07-18T03:51:43.000Z"
