Hello,
 
Thank you for your time in today's session.
 
In the meeting we have checked what is causing the issue. 
 
I have investigated on my end and both tools are working, you can change the department code using this steps: 


	Open the EPP tool and change the IP with a random one and then the  department code 
	Restart the machine
	Once the machine is back, change the IP back to the one you have setup for your EPP server and add the same dept code as above.
	Update the policies and check if everything is in place.


Looking forward for your response.
 
Best regards,
