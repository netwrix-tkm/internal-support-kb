I believe you mentioned in our call that you will ask users if this is still happening with the latest agent since the original user seems to not see the issue anymore.
When you get the chance please update me on this.

Hi James,

As I have not heard from you for a while, can you let me know if you received my last email?
You mentioned you will update the server and then we can try with the latest agent and see the outcome.

Hey James,

The console can be updated, and if we do, we can also test again with the new agent provided.
You can install it from Dashboard -> Live update. or let me know your availability and I will set up a meeting for it.
As always, please make sure you have a VM snapshot before proceeding.
