"500Qk00000MXK05IAH","00437628","Support Ticket","EPP Capabilities for Monitoring/Blocking Specific Transfer Scenarios","Hello team,

I would like to ask if the EPP tool has the ability to monitor or block the following types of transfers:

1: When the following command is executed: curl --upload-file <a href='https://file.zip' target='_blank'>file.zip</a> <a href='https://transfer.sh/file.zip' target='_blank'>https://transfer.sh/file.zip</a>
2: Through a custom file server using SOCKS5
3: RDP channels
4: SSH tunnels
Can you please confirm that the EPP can handle and block/monitor these transfer scenarios?

Thank you!","","The customer asked if EPP has the ability to monitor or block the following types of transfers:
