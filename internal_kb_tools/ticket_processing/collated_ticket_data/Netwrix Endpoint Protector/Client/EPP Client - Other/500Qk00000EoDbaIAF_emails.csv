Hi Flaviu,
Any update on this ? This seems to be affecting quite a few users now. I
have another user who setup his new mac and ran into the same issue. His
hostname is case2 and username is cwilliams but each time the serial number
is pointing to a different user on the server.

Thank you for the video recording!

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

Our colleagues asked to do a series of steps that involve the following:
- generating logs on any pair of computers that swaps serial numbers(We can do this with debug mode)
- generating some logs on the EPP server and re-registering the devices
- for the above 2 steps we will need to be able to upload a file to the EPP server and also collect a file from it(this can be done either with WinScp/Filezilla or from your end)

I will attach the file that needs to be uploaded to the EPP server to this email: connectedProcedure.sql

Please let me know if we will have the possibility to upload a file to the backend/ssh of the EPP server and also download a file from it.

Also please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week so we can do the above steps together.

Hello Bharani,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00418922. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00418922
Ticket Subject: Serial Number bug
Ticket Details: HI Team,
The issue with serial number bug is still causing us pain(I previously opened a ticket to address this and this issue still persist). Just to give a quick recap: when I lookup a machine against it's serial number. I notice each time I lookup for a machine against its serial number, the host just changes.

Thank you!

Hi Flaviu,

Any update on this ? This seems to be affecting quite a few users now. I have another user who setup his new mac and ran into the same issue. His hostname is case2 and username is cwilliams but each time the serial number is pointing to a different user on the server. 

 

Reg,

Bharani

Hello Bharani,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00418922. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00418922
Ticket Subject: Serial Number bug
Ticket Details: HI Team,
The issue with serial number bug is still causing us pain(I previously opened a ticket to address this and this issue still persist). Just to give a quick recap: when I lookup a machine against it's serial number. I notice each time I lookup for a machine against its serial number, the host just changes.

Thank you!

Hi Bharanisai,

Thank you for the video recording!

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

Our colleagues asked to do a series of steps that involve the following:
- generating logs on any pair of computers that swaps serial numbers(We can do this with debug mode)
- generating some logs on the EPP server and re-registering the devices
- for the above 2 steps we will need to be able to upload a file to the EPP server and also collect a file from it(this can be done either with WinScp/Filezilla or from your end)

I will attach the file that needs to be uploaded to the EPP server to this email: connectedProcedure.sql

Please let me know if we will have the possibility to upload a file to the backend/ssh of the EPP server and also download a file from it.

Also please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week so we can do the above steps together.

Hi Bharanisai,

Thank you for the video recording!

We have just received an update from our colleagues on this.

Our colleagues asked to do a series of steps that involve the following:
- generating logs on any pair of computers that swaps serial numbers(We can do this with debug mode)
- generating some logs on the EPP server and re-registering the devices
- for the above 2 steps we will need to be able to upload a file to the EPP server and also collect a file from it(this can be done either with WinScp/Filezilla or from your end)

I will attach the file that needs to be uploaded to the EPP server to this email: connectedProcedure.sql

Please let me know if we will have the possibility to upload a file to the backend/ssh of the EPP server and also download a file from it.

Also please let me know if you have availability for a remote session next week so we can do the above steps together.

Hi Flaviu,

Any update on this ? This seems to be affecting quite a few users now. I have another user who setup his new mac and ran into the same issue. His hostname is case2 and username is cwilliams but each time the serial number is pointing to a different user on the server. 

 

Reg,

Bharani

Ticket Number: 00418922
Ticket Subject: Serial Number bug
Ticket Details: HI Team,
The issue with serial number bug is still causing us pain(I previously opened a ticket to address this and this issue still persist). Just to give a quick recap: when I lookup a machine against it's serial number. I notice each time I lookup for a machine against its serial number, the host just changes.

Thank you!
