Thank you for the log. The log contains the server IP.
Can you please collect a set of logs from that computer?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Wait 2 minutes.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.


Kind regards

hello 
We were unable to collect the logs you requested. 

After several attempts, I installed client version 5.8.2.5 and 
and confirmed that it is communicating normally. 

We will reopen the case at a later date. 

Thank you for your support.","Netwrix Support Ticket #437882 - Server IP and Port  “not set” on client","kj.shin@viccns.com","Kwang-jae Shin","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-19T06:57:14.000Z","true"
