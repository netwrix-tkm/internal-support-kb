@WaitingOnEngineerÂ As we agreed please ask if they can reproduce the issue with applications other than WhatsApp. Because we were unable to reproduce the issue, please also ask for more details how to reproduce it. For example, currently the first instruction is: ""Updated the EPP client and waited 30 seconds to reflect changes. Application still working"", but what had they do before this on the server? What does ""Application still working"" mean? They managed to start it when it was in the deny list, or it was started from the beginning and they thought that epp-client will close it (which we do not do)?.The attached recording does not show any server setting, just the user refreshing epp-client and clicking on The WhatsApp icon.

@WaitingOnEngineer Hi Alin, if I understand correctly, according to the comment on 27th November, the customer's current problem is that they can not start Skype. They say, that they block no application, however in epp_logs.zip we can see that they are using a policy called ""HOD POLICY - TEST"", and this policy blocks both Skype and WhatsApp with the following rules:

Skype.exe
Skype.exe --skype
WhatsApp.exe
WhatsApp.exe *

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Andrei, I checked the logs. They show, that there were cases when epp-client received 2 policies, 1 and even 0. When epp-client has not blocked Whatsapp epp-client had no policies. I can not tell why, it could happen that

	 - 	all policies were turned off on the server
	 - 	the server has not sent any policies despite there were active ones
	 - 	epp-client has not read the policy from reprovision.db (this would be strange because other settings were read)

Please check again, and collect the logs, reprovision.db and options.ini the monent when the issue reproduces. I need to know what reprovision.db contained at that moment. The last reprovision.db was probably saved after Whatsapp blocking worked again, because it contains a policy, which was read by epp-client.

@WaitingOnEngineer

Hi Andrei, I checked the logs.

There is no policy loaded until 10:16:59. Before this, Whatsapp was started at 04:09:09, which seems to be normal, because there were no policies loaded.

At 10:13:00 ""NORMAL USER POLICY"" was loaded.

Between 10:13:55 and 10:14:07 there were 7 attempts to start Whatsapp, but according to the logs these were all blocked.

What was the time when the customer reproduced the issue?

@WaitingOnEngineerHi, blocking Whatsapp website should work if they remove ""
*.whatsapp.com"" from the domain whitelist (Denylists and Allowlists -> Allowlists -> Deep Packet Inspection).

@WaitingOnEngineer Please provide more information what it means exactly that ""Their current issue is the DPI certificate not applying on the browser.""? Please provide also logs.

Previously they said that their only problem remained that Whatsapp Web is not blocked. I told to removeÂ ""*.whatsapp.com"" from their allowlist, because having ""*web.whatsapp.com"" on the denylist and ""*.whatsapp.com"" on their allowlist will result in allowing web.whatsapp.com

Hi Andrei,

I hope you are well.

As Robert mentioned in a previous comment, please ask the customer to remove ""*.whatsapp.com"" from their allowlist, because having ""*web.whatsapp.com"" on the denylist and ""*.whatsapp.com"" on their allowlist will result in allowing web.whatsapp.com

Ask the to do the above and they still have issues with it, we will definitely need a new set of logs. If they don't send a new set of logs dev team will not be in a position to successfully debug and further investigate the issue.

Thank you,
Cristi

Hi Andrei,

Are the new issues related to the initial issue the customer raised?

If not, then the subject of this specific escalation is solved, so please raise a new one.
