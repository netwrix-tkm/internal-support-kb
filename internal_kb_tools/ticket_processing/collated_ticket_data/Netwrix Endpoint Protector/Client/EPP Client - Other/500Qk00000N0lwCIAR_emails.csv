Thanks for reaching out!

Is this happening for one or more computers? Can those computers ping the server's IP?

Could you please also check if you have enough licenses in System Configuration -> System licensing and send a screenshot?

Please send the following screenshot of the EPP client:
In order to check if the client is communicating with the server, please follow these instructions:
1. Open the EPP client and go to the Settings tab
2. Hit the following button combination depending on what OS you’re on:
- Windows: ctrl + alt + i
- MacOS: option + command + i
3. If the client is communicating with the server, the Server IP and Port will show the IP and the port, and it will show as connected. It will also show when the time of the last server connection

Hi,
now it works. I deleted old computer-accounts, so free licenses are available.
Thanks for the hints.
I'll close the ticket.
