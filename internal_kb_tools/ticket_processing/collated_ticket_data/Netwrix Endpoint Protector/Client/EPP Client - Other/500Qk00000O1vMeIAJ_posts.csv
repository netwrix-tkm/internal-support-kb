We are currently having issues with our Mac endpoints. Once we install Endpoint Protector on a Mac system, some domains (for example atlassian) has load times of 30+ seconds. After removing EEP from affected systems, loading times drastically go down (4-6 seconds, depending on the hardware). We tested as much as we could on all OS, and only Mac is having this issue. We would like to set up a meeting, where we could show our case live, and discuss potential fixes.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-14T14:19:43.000Z"

The customer used about 1000 urls for the url deny list. There were some duplicates in the list and the customers are going to review the deny lists.
Also a set of logs will be collected during the next week so we can investigate what can be improved on our side.","","","","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2025-04-16T17:05:19.000Z"
