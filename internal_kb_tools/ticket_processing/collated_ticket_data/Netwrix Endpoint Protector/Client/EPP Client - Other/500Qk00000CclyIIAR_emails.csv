As discussed during the meeting, I am sending here a summary of how we are standing so far:

- slowness of outlook - can be solved by disabling DPI only for Outlook application and maintaining the EPP ADDON in place, which basically will offer same functionalities for Email Domain Allowlist etc.
- other applications that were showing errors - solved by enabling Stealthy DPI
- Microsoft Android Studio download error - solved by enabling Stealthy DPI

As a conclusion - we propose you to use the Stealthy DPI as this seems to solve the problems signaled so far and if any problems will appear for any other apps we will debug together, helping you further find the best configuration for Alcatel environment.
