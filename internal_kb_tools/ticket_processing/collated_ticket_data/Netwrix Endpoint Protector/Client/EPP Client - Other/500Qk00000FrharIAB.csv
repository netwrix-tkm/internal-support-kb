We have observed that whatsapp is unblocked for few seconds and then it blocks again after a while. P.S. server version is 5.9.4.0 but it does not give option to choose it in the server version list.","","DPI did not apply to websited due to item in the allowlists.
We removed those items and DPI applies correctly.
