Hi
I'm sorry for not getting back to you late. The user has installed the
certificate on the Mac machine, but the DPI shows that the certificate is
not trusted. As a result, we have disabled DPI on the dashboard. Ideally,
it should show as trusted.
Please find the details
certificate added:

Thank you for getting back to us.

After you download and drag the certificate to your system, you will have to click on it and on the Trust option select always trust. 
In this way the certificate will become trusted and the DPI will work.

Could you please check and let us know the outcome? 

Looking forward for your response.

Did you receive the previous email form my colleague?

""Hello Ramesh,

Thank you for getting back to us.

After you download and drag the certificate to your system, you will have to click on it and on the Trust option select always trust. 
In this way the certificate will become trusted and the DPI will work.

Could you please check and let us know the outcome? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
