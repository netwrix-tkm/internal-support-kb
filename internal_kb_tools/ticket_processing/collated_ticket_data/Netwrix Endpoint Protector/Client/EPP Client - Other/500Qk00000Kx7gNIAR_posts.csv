The database was backed up from the on-prem environment and was imported into the SaaS environment. Then, the customer on two test Mac machines tried to run the IP Change script through JAMF using the FQDN of the server as the IP to move the machine to the new environment. The machine shows up and is showing as Online and Licensed. However, the machine itself is showing that it is not connected to the server. Looking at the logs, it seems as though the machine is in a registration loop with the server ending in a cert read error before starting the cycle again.","","","","005Qk000002Fjy9IAC","2025-01-22T21:39:16.000Z"
