"500Qk00000OPgB8IAL","00443100","Support Ticket","Scan Results and Further Scanning","Good morning Netwrix Team, 

Again, thank you so much for all your help. I have two questions. My first question is, when it comes to eDiscovery scans, what determines the speed of the scan? Are the eDiscovery scans dependent on my device, or are they dependent on the server and other conditions? 

My second question is that I was tasked recently in attempting to find instances of Microsoft Internet Information Service, NET application development files, and/or Microsoft SQL files. Would you happen to know if this is possible or how this can be integrated within the eDiscovery scans or where I would be able to do this? 

Thank you again for your support please email me at <a href='https://daniel.madrigal@lausd.net' target='_blank'>daniel.madrigal@lausd.net</a> for I do not have a direct line.

Sincerely,

LAUSD IT Security.","","We answered the two questions the customer addressed.
