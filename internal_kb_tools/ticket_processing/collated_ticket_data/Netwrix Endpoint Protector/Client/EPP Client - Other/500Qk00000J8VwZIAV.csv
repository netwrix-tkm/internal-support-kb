"500Qk00000J8VwZIAV","00428988","Support Ticket","Deploying multiple Linux machines","Hi Team,

How can we deploy DLP on multiple Ubuntu Linux machines with less efforts. ?

Which Ubuntu versions are supported for the DLP ?
Should I update my Netwrix server or Client version for this ?

Same question for Windows :
How can we deploy DLP in windows system at once if in same domain ?


I'm open for a zoom call if possible.
