Thank you for contacting our Support Department. 

Content Integrity Fail event can have multiple causes, for example :
- Requires full disk access
- Certificate was not imported in Keychain
- User doesn't allow the network extension
- Installation file missing
- Bluetooth permissions not granted

If you want to see more information about what caused the Client Integrity Fail event, then please go to server UI > Reports and Analysis > Logs Reports > then enable columns 'File Name' and 'File Type' from 'Show/Hide columns' section.

The Unplanned Client Termination event, is usually caused by a forced shutdown of the machine (power loss for example) or for some reason the EppClient gets killed by the operating system, or crashes for some reason (in this latter case, the client will start back automatically). Any kind of ungraceful shutdown of the client will trigger the event. 

Should you require any details or additional information, do not hesitate to reply. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Team,

Thanks for the quick and valuable feedback.
We have one more doubt if user policy is received in Reports and Analysis
then clients are connecting with the server right ?
How can we ensure that the clients are communicating to the server? Can you
share the short keys to check the status for mac.

Thank you for getting back to us.

In order to check if the EPP client is communicating with the server please use the following shortcut : Command key + ALT key + I , while you are under the settings tab in EPP client.

Also if the communication is not working try to run the following command from the MAC terminal
telnet server IP 443

Please check and let us know if we can assist you with anything else.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Vasanth, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

In order to check if the EPP client is communicating with the server please use the following shortcut : Command key + ALT key + I , while you are under the settings tab in EPP client.

Also if the communication is not working try to run the following command from the MAC terminal
telnet server IP 443

Please check and let us know if we can assist you with anything else.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Team,
 

Thanks for the quick and valuable feedback.

We have one more doubt if user policy is received in Reports and Analysis then clients are connecting with the server right ?

How can we ensure that the clients are communicating to the server? Can you share the short keys to check the status for mac.

Hello Vasantha,

Thank you for contacting our Support Department. 

Content Integrity Fail event can have multiple causes, for example :
- Requires full disk access
- Certificate was not imported in Keychain
- User doesn't allow the network extension
- Installation file missing
- Bluetooth permissions not granted

If you want to see more information about what caused the Client Integrity Fail event, then please go to server UI > Reports and Analysis > Logs Reports > then enable columns 'File Name' and 'File Type' from 'Show/Hide columns' section.

The Unplanned Client Termination event, is usually caused by a forced shutdown of the machine (power loss for example) or for some reason the EppClient gets killed by the operating system, or crashes for some reason (in this latter case, the client will start back automatically). Any kind of ungraceful shutdown of the client will trigger the event. 

Should you require any details or additional information, do not hesitate to reply. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Vasanth, 

Thank you for getting back to us.

In order to check if the EPP client is communicating with the server please use the following shortcut : Command key + ALT key + I , while you are under the settings tab in EPP client.

Also if the communication is not working try to run the following command from the MAC terminal
telnet server IP 443

Please check and let us know if we can assist you with anything else.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Team,
 

Thanks for the quick and valuable feedback.

We have one more doubt if user policy is received in Reports and Analysis then clients are connecting with the server right ?

How can we ensure that the clients are communicating to the server? Can you share the short keys to check the status for mac.

Hello Vasantha,

Thank you for contacting our Support Department. 

Content Integrity Fail event can have multiple causes, for example :
- Requires full disk access
- Certificate was not imported in Keychain
- User doesn't allow the network extension
- Installation file missing
- Bluetooth permissions not granted

If you want to see more information about what caused the Client Integrity Fail event, then please go to server UI > Reports and Analysis > Logs Reports > then enable columns 'File Name' and 'File Type' from 'Show/Hide columns' section.

The Unplanned Client Termination event, is usually caused by a forced shutdown of the machine (power loss for example) or for some reason the EppClient gets killed by the operating system, or crashes for some reason (in this latter case, the client will start back automatically). Any kind of ungraceful shutdown of the client will trigger the event. 

Should you require any details or additional information, do not hesitate to reply. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
