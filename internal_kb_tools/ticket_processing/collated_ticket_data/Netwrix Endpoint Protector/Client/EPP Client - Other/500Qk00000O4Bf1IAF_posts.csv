​​​​​​​
Today in our remote session we discovered that Deep Packet Inspection was turned on but Stealthy DPI Driver was not turned on, which caused some web pages not to load on the affected endpoint machine.
After we have enabled ""Stealthy DPI Driver"" for the affected endpoint machine under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" > ""Manage Settings"" > ""DPI Configuration"" , the web browsing resumed as expected.

Stealthy DPI Driver is a feature that enhances Deep Packet Inspection functionality, especially if you have 3rd party software installed like antivirus, VPN and other cybersecurity software.  It enabled Endpoint Protector to work alongside other applications by eliminating interference between applications.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-04-15T17:49:43.000Z"
