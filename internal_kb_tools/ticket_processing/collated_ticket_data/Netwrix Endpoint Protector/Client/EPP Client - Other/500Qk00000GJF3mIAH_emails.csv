We have just received an update from our devs on this.

They asked if we can provide them with additional log files.

Is it possible for us to schedule a remote session this week or next wee in order to generate these log files on that computer? We will also need access to that computer.

HI Flaviu, Oana
I found a workaround to the Ubuntu 24 EPP shutdown/restart issue. If I
manually edit this file and make the following changes ""TimeoutSec=30sec""
instead of ""TimeoutSec=5min"" it shuts the machine down in 30 seconds. sudo
systemctl edit --full epp-client-daemon.service.

In the installation package you would need to change the service shutdown
time to lower time to reflect this.

HI Flaviu, Oana

I found a workaround to the Ubuntu 24 EPP shutdown/restart issue. If I manually edit this file and make the following changes ""TimeoutSec=30sec"" instead of ""TimeoutSec=5min"" it shuts the machine down in 30 seconds. sudo systemctl edit --full epp-client-daemon.service. 

 


In the installation package you would need to change the service shutdown time to lower time to reflect this.

Hi Bharani,

We have just received an update from our devs on this.

They asked if we can provide them with additional log files.

Is it possible for us to schedule a remote session this week or next wee in order to generate these log files on that computer? We will also need access to that computer.

3. $ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log
4. $ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Please send us this log file: epp_client_daemon_append.log. It is an appended log file, meaning that the log file will not re-write itself after the reboot/shutdown.
