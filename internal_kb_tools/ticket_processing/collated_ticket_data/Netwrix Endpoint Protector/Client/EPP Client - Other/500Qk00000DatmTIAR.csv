"500Qk00000DatmTIAR","00416239","Support Ticket","Certificate hostname mismatch","Hello Support Team,

I got two pop-ups which indicates a connection drop because of a certificate hostname mismatch. I could find the errors in the <a href='https://eppclient.log' target='_blank'>eppclient.log</a>.

What does this error mean? If it is related with DPI Bypass, i can see a DPI bypass event for <a href='https://play.google.com' target='_blank'>play.google.com</a> but not for <a href='https://bam.eu01.nr-data.net' target='_blank'>bam.eu01.nr-data.net</a>

Thanks,

The customer should collect a new set of logs if the issue happens again.","Solved in 5941","","Emil Podar","Enhancement","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","240.9","Closed - Resolved","Booking.com","Serhat Demir","2024-07-26T13:49:36.000Z","2025-03-24T10:48:41.000Z"
