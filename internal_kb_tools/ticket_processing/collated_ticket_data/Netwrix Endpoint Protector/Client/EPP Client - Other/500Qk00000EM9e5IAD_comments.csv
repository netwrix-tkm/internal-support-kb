Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Currently, our QA team is testing the new MacOS version (Sequoia).

We will come back to you with results as soon as we can.

Regards,
Cristi

Hi @Krzysztof Staszalek @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan 
I have talked with @Alex Puskas  about the changes introduced by Apple starting with Sequoia related to permission to scan devices on local network. This feature should be investigated more in depth, in order to see on how it's affecting the Notifier installed on Mac.

@WaitingOnEngineer

After investigation we have the following conclusions:

	 - 	this pop-up is triggered when the epp agent tries to enumerate the printer devices (even if the user will click on deny from our tests, the network printer can be controlled, I hope Apple will not change anything in the latest macOS release)
	 - 	currently NO API to detect this pop-up to be triggered
	 - 	currently NO MDM method to suppress this pop-up
Apple answer:
""There is no way to automatically allow or disallow the local network privacy prompt. If it shows up in your app then you will need to analyze your app’s code to get a better idea on how the prompt is being triggered. If the prompt is being triggered from a library that you do not control then you will need to remove that library or inquire further about this functionality with the library vendor.”


This pop-up seems to be a hassle for everyone, including Apple, as they will likely receive numerous inquiries about the message and how to prevent it.

We also put some questions related to this topic (please see the following thread):
