@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan  Yes, this issue is a duplicate of the linked one. We should probably close one of them. 

@WaitingOnEngineer 

The customer is right, we managed to reproduce the issue. Very good finding. The issue was with one of the libraries that EPP is using (libevent). I've prepared a build with an updated version of this library, in my case with this build the issue does not reproduce anymore. Build location: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_08_12EPPClient_v6.2.3.0052

Please send this build to the customer for testing. If we get a confirmation that the issue is fixed, we will have to check when we want this in the product (I suppose 5950 since this is an important issue) and there will still be some more work for updating this library.
