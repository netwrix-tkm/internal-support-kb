In order to fix the problem, we had to add the applications that are getting blocked to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"" - Whitelist. We have had the product for a number of years and never had to do this before. Note: we are only using this for monitoring and blocking for printing - (DLP for printing). One question I have is can I turn off Device Control policies altogether, I wonder if that is what is blocking applications from running?
Thanks
