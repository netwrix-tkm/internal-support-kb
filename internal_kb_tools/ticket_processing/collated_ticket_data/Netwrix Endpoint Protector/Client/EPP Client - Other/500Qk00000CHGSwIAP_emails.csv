Yes, the installation was done on a ""new computer"" outside of Escale's corporate structure, which is Arthur's personal (home) machine.

 

He used this equipment precisely to facilitate testing and avoid a configuration residue from previous versions of the product. This is customer feedback.

Hi Tiago,

Can you confirm that you installed the test build on a computer with the issue and tested it?
If you have not, please make sure you uninstall the current agent, reboot the computer, and then install the agent sent by Emil from this link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip
Please do not forget the reboot because of how Windows uses RAM.
Let me know the outcome of the test.

Thank you,

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Tiago,

As the engineers told me, the issue will be addressed in the 5950 Server update. 
For the Brazil PIIs we do not have many checksums and this is the cause for the false positives.
The workaround for the issue would be to use the contextual detection rules, in order to detect and report the Brazil PIIs when they are in the proximity of specific key words.

We will try to create a context detection rule and test this during our meeting Friday.

Best regards,
Emil

Yes, the installation was done on a ""new computer"" outside of Escale's corporate structure, which is Arthur's personal (home) machine.

He used this equipment precisely to facilitate testing and avoid a configuration residue from previous versions of the product. This is customer feedback.

Hi Tiago,

Can you confirm that you installed the test build on a computer with the issue and tested it?
If you have not, please make sure you uninstall the current agent, reboot the computer, and then install the agent sent by Emil from this link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip
Please do not forget the reboot because of how Windows uses RAM.
Let me know the outcome of the test.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Can you please let me know your timezone and availability, today and tomorrow, for a remote session so I can set that up?

Hi Tiago,

Regarding the metadata issue and the test build provided. Were there any improvements in the detection of Brazilian PII compared to the agent provided in 5.9.4.0? Are you seeing the same events and logs in both agents without any differences?
Any information, the more granular the better, will help engineering.

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Tiago,

Engineering asked me to gather a new set of logs for the metadata issue using the test build provided earlier by my colleague Emil.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability, today and tomorrow, for a remote session so I can set that up?

Hi Tiago,

Regarding the metadata issue and the test build provided. Were there any improvements in the detection of Brazilian PII compared to the agent provided in 5.9.4.0? Are you seeing the same events and logs in both agents without any differences?
Any information, the more granular the better, will help engineering.

Yes, the installation was done on a ""new computer"" outside of Escale's corporate structure, which is Arthur's personal (home) machine.

 

He used this equipment precisely to facilitate testing and avoid a configuration residue from previous versions of the product. This is customer feedback.

Hi Tiago,

Can you confirm that you installed the test build on a computer with the issue and tested it?
If you have not, please make sure you uninstall the current agent, reboot the computer, and then install the agent sent by Emil from this link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip
Please do not forget the reboot because of how Windows uses RAM.
Let me know the outcome of the test.

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Tiago,

As the engineers told me, the issue will be addressed in the 5950 Server update. 
For the Brazil PIIs we do not have many checksums and this is the cause for the false positives.
The workaround for the issue would be to use the contextual detection rules, in order to detect and report the Brazil PIIs when they are in the proximity of specific key words.

We will try to create a context detection rule and test this during our meeting Friday.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Tiago,

As the engineers told me, the issue will be addressed in the 5950 Server update. 
For the Brazil PIIs we do not have many checksums and this is the cause for the false positives.
The workaround for the issue would be to use the contextual detection rules, in order to detect and report the Brazil PIIs when they are in the proximity of specific key words.

We will try to create a context detection rule and test this during our meeting Friday.

Best regards,
Emil

Regarding the metadata issue and the test build provided. Were there any improvements in the detection of Brazilian PII compared to the agent provided in 5.9.4.0? Are you seeing the same events and logs in both agents without any differences?
Any information, the more granular the better, will help engineering.

Yes, the installation was done on a ""new computer"" outside of Escale's corporate structure, which is Arthur's personal (home) machine.

 

He used this equipment precisely to facilitate testing and avoid a configuration residue from previous versions of the product. This is customer feedback.

Hi Tiago,

Can you confirm that you installed the test build on a computer with the issue and tested it?
If you have not, please make sure you uninstall the current agent, reboot the computer, and then install the agent sent by Emil from this link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip
Please do not forget the reboot because of how Windows uses RAM.
Let me know the outcome of the test.

Thank you,

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Tiago,

Can you confirm that you installed the test build on a computer with the issue and tested it?
If you have not, please make sure you uninstall the current agent, reboot the computer, and then install the agent sent by Emil from this link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip
Please do not forget the reboot because of how Windows uses RAM.
Let me know the outcome of the test.

Thank you,

Hello Tiago,

For the issue where the EPP Client is blocking the metadata of the file we have a test build which can be installed and verified with the customer:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp30102024/EppClient_v6.2.4.0022.zip

Please install the agent on one of the computers and let me know if the files are still wrongly blocked because of the metadata.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Tiago,

As the engineers told me, the issue will be addressed in the 5950 Server update.
For the Brazil PIIs we do not have many checksums and this is the cause for the false positives.
The workaround for the issue would be to use the contextual detection rules, in order to detect and report the Brazil PIIs when they are in the proximity of specific key words.

We will try to create a context detection rule and test this during our meeting Friday.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Tiago,

Regarding the metadata issue and the test build provided. Were there any improvements in the detection of Brazilian PII compared to the agent provided in 5.9.4.0? Are you seeing the same events and logs in both agents without any differences?
Any information, the more granular the better, will help engineering.

Hello Tiago,

As the engineers told me, the issue will be addressed in the 5950 Server update. 
For the Brazil PIIs we do not have many checksums and this is the cause for the false positives.
The workaround for the issue would be to use the contextual detection rules, in order to detect and report the Brazil PIIs when they are in the proximity of specific key words.

We will try to create a context detection rule and test this during our meeting Friday.

Best regards,
Emil
