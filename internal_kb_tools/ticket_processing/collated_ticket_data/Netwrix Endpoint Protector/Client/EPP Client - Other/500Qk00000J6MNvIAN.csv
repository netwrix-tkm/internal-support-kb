"500Qk00000J6MNvIAN","00428880","Support Ticket","DLP Policies","The latest version of the EndPoint Protector blocks some applications from running. In order to fix the problem, we had to add the applications that are getting blocked to ""Advanced Scanning Exceptions"" - Whitelist. We have had the product for a number of years and never had to do this before. Note: we are only using this for monitoring and blocking for printing - (DLP for printing). One question I have is can I turn off Device Control policies altogether, I wonder if that is what is blocking applications from running?
Thanks
Pete","","","","The customer reported issues with the EPP blocking some applications after upgrading the server to the 5940 version. Updateing the epp-client agents have solverd this issues.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","15.0","Closed - Resolved","Citizens & Northern Bank","Pete Boergermann","2024-12-04T19:56:55.000Z","2024-12-19T20:00:33.000Z"
