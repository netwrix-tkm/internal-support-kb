Hi Andrei,

 

the event types are different. An export is attached.

I will check next week whether other clients generate an event in the future and if so, activate the debug log.

 

I cannot check it with version 6.2.4.2. We have not packaged this version. 

The latest version we have packaged is 6.2.3.3001. This is currently being rolled out.

 

Regards

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you please confirm if this is happening for one or more computers?
Does this happen on computers with the latest epp client? (version 6.2.4.2)
Does this happen on specific logs, like policies received (seen in the shared image) or Connected, Blocked Unblocked logs?

On 2 computer where this is happening more often, can you please enable the append logs that will continue to take the logs until you can confirm this happened again?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
4.c Select Create Append Log file and click Execute
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Wait for an erroneous log to be generated.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MMgK6:ref

 


Hi Andrei,

 

the log entry with the time in the future only occurs sporadically.

The correct date/time (client) is then written. For LPTP2063620 it’s one entry since 01.12.2024 (see screenshot).



Collecting the log files will therefore not help. Otherwise the wrong date would be written permanently.

 

Regards

Hello,

Usually, client time is taken from the computer.
Can you please confirm the time on the computer and collect a set of logs?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Trigger a log.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000MMgK6:ref

 


Hi Andrei,

 

the log entry with the time in the future only occurs sporadically.

The correct date/time (client) is then written. For LPTP2063620 it’s one entry since 01.12.2024 (see screenshot).



Collecting the log files will therefore not help. Otherwise the wrong date would be written permanently.

 

Regards

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hello,

Usually, client time is taken from the computer.
Can you please confirm the time on the computer and collect a set of logs?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Trigger a log.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Alin,

I cannot provide any log files here, as the error with Date/Time (Client) only occurs sporadically and the log files are then created with the correct timestamp.

LPTP2006287: Error only occurred on 21.01.2025. Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp[cid:image002.png@01DB93FB.58B876C0].

B2055396: Error only occurred on 07.01.2025 . Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp

[cid:image003.png@01DB93FB.58B876C0]

DSKT2010089: Error only occurred on 10.03.2025 . Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp

Hi Andrei,

the event types are different. An export is attached.
I will check next week whether other clients generate an event in the future and if so, activate the debug log.

I cannot check it with version 6.2.4.2. We have not packaged this version.
The latest version we have packaged is 6.2.3.3001. This is currently being rolled out.

Regards

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you please confirm if this is happening for one or more computers?
Does this happen on computers with the latest epp client? (version 6.2.4.2)
Does this happen on specific logs, like policies received (seen in the shared image) or Connected, Blocked Unblocked logs?

On 2 computer where this is happening more often, can you please enable the append logs that will continue to take the logs until you can confirm this happened again?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
4.c Select Create Append Log file and click Execute
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Wait for an erroneous log to be generated.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Hi Alin,

 

I cannot provide any log files here, as the error with Date/Time (Client) only occurs sporadically and the log files are then created with the correct timestamp.

 

LPTP2006287: Error only occurred on 21.01.2025. Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp.

 

B2055396: Error only occurred on 07.01.2025 . Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp

 



 

DSKT2010089: Error only occurred on 10.03.2025 . Afterwards, all events had the correct timestamp



 

Regards

 

 


Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Hi Andrei,

 

the event types are different. An export is attached.

I will check next week whether other clients generate an event in the future and if so, activate the debug log.

 

I cannot check it with version 6.2.4.2. We have not packaged this version. 

The latest version we have packaged is 6.2.3.3001. This is currently being rolled out.

 

Regards

Hello,

Thank you for the information.
Can you please confirm if this is happening for one or more computers?
Does this happen on computers with the latest epp client? (version 6.2.4.2)
Does this happen on specific logs, like policies received (seen in the shared image) or Connected, Blocked Unblocked logs?

On 2 computer where this is happening more often, can you please enable the append logs that will continue to take the logs until you can confirm this happened again?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
4.c Select Create Append Log file and click Execute
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Wait for an erroneous log to be generated.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

 

the log entry with the time in the future only occurs sporadically.

The correct date/time (client) is then written. For LPTP2063620 it’s one entry since 01.12.2024 (see screenshot).



Collecting the log files will therefore not help. Otherwise the wrong date would be written permanently.

Hello,

Usually, client time is taken from the computer.
Can you please confirm the time on the computer and collect a set of logs?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.

This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Trigger a log.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

I hope you are well.
The team investigated this issue and concluded that no logs from the future are being sent at this time, and the computers that have logs from the future, are now logging with event_time_local correct.
This means the computer date was changed when those logs were made.
Please check also on your side if everything is fine and let us know if the ticket can be closed after that.

HI Alin,

The problem still exists. The number of events go down, but some clients still generate events in the future.
e. g. LSJP240283, LPTP2051013

Hello Anatoli,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00437187. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00437187
Ticket Subject: Date Time Client in the future
Ticket Details: Hallo Support,

We have noticed that some clients generate logs in the console that are in the future.
e. g. LPTP2063620 (Date/Time (Client): 2055-02-27 07:20:21)
The previous events seem to match and the new ones too, but there is an outlier.
Unfortunately, multiple clients are affected.

Please check and fix it.

Regards

Anatoli

Thank you!

Hi Alin,

the client LSJP240283 is currenty offline.

Please let me know, via which setting/registry Endpoint Protector detects the date.
The only setting on the Windows client that I found that could resulted in a date in the future was changing the region format to “Thai”. Then 2568 is shown in the calendar.

We have received a request from the engineering team in order to continue the investigation, as seen below:

The EPP agent code gets the client event time using directly a Windows API (GetSystemTime), without any interpretation. In this case, it would be helpful to have the Windows Event Viewer logs (eventvwr.msc) for ""Windows Logs -> System"" for the specified date ranges. Unsuccessful synchronization with either RTC or NTP servers might cause an incorrect UTC time and this should be logged by the OS itself.

Hallo Alin,

By exporting the system events, I was able to verify that the system time was changed. The events also contained entries with the year 2045.
[cid:image001.png@01DBAE15.B5C9D050]

Further analysis must be performed on the BMW side.

Thanks for the support.
