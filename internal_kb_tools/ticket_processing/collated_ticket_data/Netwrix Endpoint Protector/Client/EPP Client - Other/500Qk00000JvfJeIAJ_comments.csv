The mentioned file is indeed, a file that belongs to EPP. And yes, we are aware that sometimes it is flagged as virus/malware. If I recall correctly, also Sophos was flagging it like this. Now, going further, I can't be 100% sure that the file the customer has locally is a valid one. I tried to compare the hash with the hashes I found for that file in the latest 3 production builds and none of them matched with this hash. I might have missed something though. Normally, if the customer wants us to check, we should know what is the client version the customer is using and I can check the hash of the executable from that build and compare it with this one. Ideally, the customer should also send us that .exe and we can check it.

The executable that was provided doesn't have the MD5 hash mentioned in the description and finally I figured out why. The customer provided us SHA-1 hash, not MD5 as I was expecting. Anyway, this would have worked faster if we knew the client version as well. In the end I managed to find that the executable file the customer provided us is the one from the EPP client build v5611 (October 2021, patch 5405). I can confirm that the file is the correct one and it is not a malware.
