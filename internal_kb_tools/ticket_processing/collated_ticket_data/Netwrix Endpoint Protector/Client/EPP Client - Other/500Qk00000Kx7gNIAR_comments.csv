If the attached log was collected after running the ""Change IP"" script, then this is not a problem of that script, but rather a problem with the new server: ""bm5zph4.hosted.endpointprotector.com"".

The logs contain some HTTP 500 internal server error codes as well as some HTTP 401 Unauthorized codes.

The first error could indicate a problem on the server (e.g. such as no disk space) and the later could be caused by a server error or by a load balancer in the customer's network that strips the client certificate. Either way someone from the server team should take a look.

Hi,

Please verify with the customer that no additional certificate types are enabled, such as the Client Registration Certificate or Increased Communication Security. These settings can be reviewed on the Appliance → Server Maintenance page.


Please try to follow the steps below:



	 - 	Verify the integrity of the configuration file at  /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml to ensure it is not corrupted. Refer to the backend procedure for the expected file structure.
	 - 	Determine whether the customer is using a custom Nginx configuration or a non-standard port.
	 - 	 Regenerate the full-stack certificates by executing:

	 - 	

--- CODE ---bash /opt/functions.sh run regenerateCertsV2Callable 3502--- CODE ---

	 - 	Then, restart the Nginx service:

	 - 	service nginx restart  
	 - 	Confirm with the customer that ports 443 and 80 are open. If a custom port is in use, verify its accessibility as well.


Validate communication after performing these steps.


If the previous steps did not resolve the issue, enable registration logs on the server by following these steps:




	 - 	Edit the web service PHP file using:


	 - 	vim /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php

	 - 	Set the following parameters:


	 - 	define('DEBUG_VERBOSITY', 1011);
	 - 	   
define('DEBUG', true);

	 - 	Force the registration of a specific machine by executing the following SQL commands:

	 - 	Retrieve the machine ID:


	 - 	

--- CODE ---SELECT id FROM clientmachine WHERE name = 'machine_name';
--- CODE ---


	 - 	(Replace 'machine_name' with the actual machine name.)
	 - 	

--- CODE ---DELETE FROM certificate WHERE assigned_to = machine_id;

UPDATE license SET assigned_to = machine_id;
UPDATE clientmachine SET reregister = 1, trialversion = NULL WHERE id = machine_id;
--- CODE ---


	 - 	(Replace machine_id with the ID obtained from the first query.)

	 - 	Update policy.
	 - 	❗Revert the changes from step 2 by setting DEBUG to false and DEBUG_VERBOSITY to 1007.
	 - 	Provide the logs collected into: /EPPServer/sieratool/log/WebServiceFree.log 



Regards,
Augustina

 Regenerating the full-stack certificates resolved the issue for them. It seems like there is something in their on-prem DB that we are importing that was causing the issue. This was noted after resolving the issue, then capturing a new DB dump from the on-prem server and importing that into the SaaS environment, the same issue occurred. Running the command to regenerate the cert stack resolved the issue again.","005Qk000002Fjy9IAC","2025-02-11T13:34:54.000Z","2025-02-11T13:34:54.000Z","false","false"
