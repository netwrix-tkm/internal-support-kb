Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our R&D team, that they have checked the current logs. This time the EPP client receives the list of excluded network shares. Going forward, there is a lot of scanning here, but all the files scanned are from ""C:tempGBSDownload""and not from network share like in the previous set of logs.

Moreover, they decrypted the database with the policies and it seems that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy. In this case, network share whitelist will not apply anyway.
As long as the file is transferred through a monitored application, network share whitelist is ignored. If not, one could use network share as a ""proxy"" to exfiltrate any data outside the company.
For example, the user has a confidential file on the local machine. Theoretically transferring it through a browser is blocked by EPP. But if the user copies the file on the network share (which is whitelisted) he can then upload the file, through the browser from that location (again, because the location it is whitelisted). So this is the reason why Network Share whitelist doesn't apply for transfers made by monitored apps.
The reason why Network Share whitelist was added was to give the user the possibility to browse the network share, view/open files, copy them to the local machine, but that's all, he should not be able to actually transfer them outside the company if they contain confidential info.

Finally, in the logs they see a file being scanned and blocked by the EPP client. The reason the file is blocked is the fact that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy and the file is being handled (read) by WinSCP. 

Please test without the WinSCP exit point enabled and also with the policy action set to report only.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Chris,

Thank you for your email.  My colleague Daniel Anton is currently out of office so I will answer here in his absence.

You can collect the logs using the debug mode with the Endpoint Protector client or you can collect the logs using the Support Tool.


	You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact)
	Alternatively you can follow the guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf"" this method is to collect the client logs with the Support Tool.



I hope this helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards

HI Sudipa,

 

Thanks for the feedback, we will plan to collect the log tomorrow.

 

Hi Daniel & Netwrix support,

 

Given that the log didn’t record the issue last time, may I double check with you about the log collection procedure? Is it after cososys block report comes up, we just need to send you the eppclient.log file in C drive? Or do we need to start any other process to initiate the log recording before we reproduce the issue?

Hi Daniel,

 

It is strange that last time we performed the file transfer but it is not recorded on the log. Could you please share with us how to collect the log?

 

As it is the last day of Y2024 and our GBS files must be collected, we will try to re-enable the Cososys agent and collect the log after 1st Jan.

 

Hi  @Bera, S. (Sudipa), will you be available in 2nd Jan to disable the Cososys agent after we collect the log again? Thank you.

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have tried to apply the allowlist, one more time without success. 
We have upgraded the EPP client to 6.2.3.1 , reapplied the allowlist and the file transfer is still blocked. 

I will inform my colleagues regarding this and get back to you as soon as the offline patch for 5.9.4.1 version appear. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our R&D team, that they have checked the current logs. This time the EPP client receives the list of excluded network shares. Going forward, there is a lot of scanning here, but all the files scanned are from ""C:tempGBSDownload""and not from network share like in the previous set of logs.

Moreover, they decrypted the database with the policies and it seems that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy. In this case, network share whitelist will not apply anyway.
As long as the file is transferred through a monitored application, network share whitelist is ignored. If not, one could use network share as a ""proxy"" to exfiltrate any data outside the company.
For example, the user has a confidential file on the local machine. Theoretically transferring it through a browser is blocked by EPP. But if the user copies the file on the network share (which is whitelisted) he can then upload the file, through the browser from that location (again, because the location it is whitelisted). So this is the reason why Network Share whitelist doesn't apply for transfers made by monitored apps.
The reason why Network Share whitelist was added was to give the user the possibility to browse the network share, view/open files, copy them to the local machine, but that's all, he should not be able to actually transfer them outside the company if they contain confidential info.

Finally, in the logs they see a file being scanned and blocked by the EPP client. The reason the file is blocked is the fact that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy and the file is being handled (read) by WinSCP.

Please test without the WinSCP exit point enabled and also with the policy action set to report only.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Have you manage to gather the logs using the steps my colleague sent to you ?

Could you please gather the logs and forward them to us for further analysis?

Hi Chris,

Thank you for your email.  My colleague Daniel Anton is currently out of office so I will answer here in his absence.

You can collect the logs using the debug mode with the Endpoint Protector client or you can collect the logs using the Support Tool.

  1.  You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact)
  2.  Alternatively you can follow the guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf"" this method is to collect the client logs with the Support Tool.

I hope this helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards

HI Sudipa,

Thanks for the feedback, we will plan to collect the log tomorrow.

Hi Daniel & Netwrix support,

Given that the log didn't record the issue last time, may I double check with you about the log collection procedure? Is it after cososys block report comes up, we just need to send you the eppclient.log file in C drive? Or do we need to start any other process to initiate the log recording before we reproduce the issue?

Hi Daniel,

It is strange that last time we performed the file transfer but it is not recorded on the log. Could you please share with us how to collect the log?

As it is the last day of Y2024 and our GBS files must be collected, we will try to re-enable the Cososys agent and collect the log after 1st Jan.

Hi @Bera, S. (Sudipa)<mailto:sudipa.bera@ing.com>, will you be available in 2nd Jan to disable the Cososys agent after we collect the log again? Thank you.

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

Our Engineering team investigated the logs and couldn't find the file transfer that we performed in the meeting.

Could you please start the logs one more time and redo the file transfer then share the new logs with us ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have asked the colleagues regarding the offline patch and for the moment we do not have an ETA.
They asked to check the logs collected in our last session, to verify how is reproduced.

Could you please check under your C: drive and share with us the eppclient.log file?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have tried to apply the allowlist, one more time without success.
We have upgraded the EPP client to 6.2.3.1 , reapplied the allowlist and the file transfer is still blocked.

I will inform my colleagues regarding this and get back to you as soon as the offline patch for 5.9.4.1 version appear.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patience regarding this case.

We have received an update from our R&D team, that they have checked the current logs. This time the EPP client receives the list of excluded network shares. Going forward, there is a lot of scanning here, but all the files scanned are from ""C:tempGBSDownload""and not from network share like in the previous set of logs.

Moreover, they decrypted the database with the policies and it seems that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy. In this case, network share whitelist will not apply anyway.
As long as the file is transferred through a monitored application, network share whitelist is ignored. If not, one could use network share as a ""proxy"" to exfiltrate any data outside the company.
For example, the user has a confidential file on the local machine. Theoretically transferring it through a browser is blocked by EPP. But if the user copies the file on the network share (which is whitelisted) he can then upload the file, through the browser from that location (again, because the location it is whitelisted). So this is the reason why Network Share whitelist doesn't apply for transfers made by monitored apps.
The reason why Network Share whitelist was added was to give the user the possibility to browse the network share, view/open files, copy them to the local machine, but that's all, he should not be able to actually transfer them outside the company if they contain confidential info.

Finally, in the logs they see a file being scanned and blocked by the EPP client. The reason the file is blocked is the fact that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy and the file is being handled (read) by WinSCP. 

Please test without the WinSCP exit point enabled and also with the policy action set to report only.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Chris,

Thank you for your email.  My colleague Daniel Anton is currently out of office so I will answer here in his absence.

You can collect the logs using the debug mode with the Endpoint Protector client or you can collect the logs using the Support Tool.


	You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact)
	Alternatively you can follow the guide ""How to Capture Client Logs using the Support Tool-v2 on a Windows Machine v1.2.pdf"" this method is to collect the client logs with the Support Tool.



I hope this helps, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards

HI Sudipa,

 

Thanks for the feedback, we will plan to collect the log tomorrow.

 

Hi Daniel & Netwrix support,

 

Given that the log didn’t record the issue last time, may I double check with you about the log collection procedure? Is it after cososys block report comes up, we just need to send you the eppclient.log file in C drive? Or do we need to start any other process to initiate the log recording before we reproduce the issue?

Hi Daniel,

 

It is strange that last time we performed the file transfer but it is not recorded on the log. Could you please share with us how to collect the log?

 

As it is the last day of Y2024 and our GBS files must be collected, we will try to re-enable the Cososys agent and collect the log after 1st Jan.

 

Hi  @Bera, S. (Sudipa), will you be available in 2nd Jan to disable the Cososys agent after we collect the log again? Thank you.

Hello Chris,

Thank you for your time in today's session .

In the meeting we have tried to apply the allowlist, one more time without success. 
We have upgraded the EPP client to 6.2.3.1 , reapplied the allowlist and the file transfer is still blocked. 

I will inform my colleagues regarding this and get back to you as soon as the offline patch for 5.9.4.1 version appear. 

Have a nice day ahead!
