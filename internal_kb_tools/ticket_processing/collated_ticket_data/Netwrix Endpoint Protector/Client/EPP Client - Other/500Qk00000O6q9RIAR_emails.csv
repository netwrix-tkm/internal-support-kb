Thank you for getting back to us. 

Have you added the allowlist created to the CAP policy, under the allowlist field ? 

Can you also share with us a few screenshots of the allowlist and the URL being blocked? 

Also check in the Reports&Analysis from the EPP UI and check if there are any logs for the blockage ?

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

Please find the error screenshot below.

[image: image.png]


Have you added the allowlist created to the CAP policy, under the allowlist
field ?  - We cannot whitelist all these URLs as these are redirects from
multiple other URLs.


Also check in the Reports&Analysis from the EPP UI and check if there are
any logs for the blockage ?

Please let me know how to solve this and enable these urls without
whitelisting on Netwrix.

Hi Daniel,

 

Please find the error screenshot below. 

 



 

 

Have you added the allowlist created to the CAP policy, under the allowlist field ?  - We cannot whitelist all these URLs as these are redirects from multiple other URLs.

 

 

Also check in the Reports&Analysis from the EPP UI and check if there are any logs for the blockage ?




 


Please let me know how to solve this and enable these urls without whitelisting on Netwrix.

Before we can proceed further with the case, can you please provide us the following information:

•        Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried?  - Yes, I have whitelisted the URLs in the allowlist, but they are still not working.

•        What are you trying to do or accomplish? Multiple URLs are not accessible, and we haven’t blocked them on EPP.
•        When did this issue start? - I believe the issue has been there since the beginning, but we noticed yesterday while accessing some of the URLs for business requirements.
•        Can you please let us know the Client, Server, OS version (if not already known) on which the situation is encountered? - Client Version 3.0.4.1006, MAC. 
•  On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, Google cloud platform, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS) - Not sure, I believe it is on GCP or AWS.
•       Screen shots, logs, other artifacts, etc. - We will capture it and share it with you during the next occurrence.

Thank you for getting back to us.

In the first screenshot it appears that the site doesn't have a certificate assigned, could you please check if that is the case ? 

Also verify if the certificate is either signed by us or by a trusted authority.

Regarding the default templates for CAP policies, they can be created under the EPP UI -> System parameters -> Device Types and Notifications.


Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Please find the error screenshot below. 

 



 

 

Have you added the allowlist created to the CAP policy, under the allowlist field ?  - We cannot whitelist all these URLs as these are redirects from multiple other URLs.

 

 

Also check in the Reports&Analysis from the EPP UI and check if there are any logs for the blockage ?




 


Please let me know how to solve this and enable these urls without whitelisting on Netwrix.

•        When did this issue start? - I believe the issue has been there since the beginning, but we noticed yesterday while accessing some of the URLs for business requirements.
•        Can you please let us know the Client, Server, OS version (if not already known) on which the situation is encountered? - Client Version 3.0.4.1006, MAC. 
•  On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, Google cloud platform, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS) - Not sure, I believe it is on GCP or AWS.
•       Screen shots, logs, other artifacts, etc. - We will capture it and share it with you during the next occurrence.
