They are trying to use VS Code but when they attempt to run something it keeps giving them an error inside the VS Code and they concluded it is due to the EPP client.

First checked the CAP policies along with the computer settings and the computer was not assigned to any CAP policies and also inside the settings they had DPI disabled completely along with MTP scanning.

We uninstalled the EPP and then ran again the code in VS Code and it was working.

Saw they were on 6.2.3.1 and EPP Server was 5.9.4.0.
Advised to upgrade to the latest and then install the latest 6.2.4.2 version and try again.

Client already confirmed they had a snapshot in place and will attempt later and let me know how it goes.

Gave them the offline patcher as they requested it.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-15T10:36:45.000Z"

UPDATE 24/04/2025

Connected remote to the client's machine to troubleshoot the case.
They have installed the EPP v6.2.4.2000 on the endpoint and they were getting the same error in VS Code when they were trying to run the piece of code where as while the EPP was not installed, the code was running successfully.

Currently the problematic machine did not had any CAP policies assigned and DPI was completely disabled.

We ran it first like that but the same error came up. Afterwards I enabled the DPI and also stealthy DPI and tried again but that didn't seem to help.

They said this is the only machine that had this issue and I asked to show me an example of another machine where this is not happening and what I have noticed on the machine where the issue is not happening that it had MTP scanning and Meta data enabled under computer settings.

We enabled that and restarted the machine again but it was not working as the same error came up.

Checked the eppclient.log and hooking.enable was equal to 1.

At some point, we lost the connectivity with the client and they did not respond at all through Zoom nor through the Zoom chat.

Waited about 25 minutes while I was still checking things but after seeing no sign of responses and neither through the mail I closed out.

Inisde the Advanced Scanning Exceptions they had VSCode added but just as ''VSCode'' not ''VSCode.exe''. I wanted to add but I didn't get their permission as it might have affected other devices too.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-24T11:14:34.000Z"

They are trying to use VS Code but when they attempt to run something it keeps giving them an error inside the VS Code and they concluded it is due to the EPP client.

First checked the CAP policies along with the computer settings and the computer was not assigned to any CAP policies and also inside the settings they had DPI disabled completely along with MTP scanning.

We uninstalled the EPP and then ran again the code in VS Code and it was working.

Saw they were on 6.2.3.1 and EPP Server was 5.9.4.0.
Advised to upgrade to the latest and then install the latest 6.2.4.2 version and try again.

Client already confirmed they had a snapshot in place and will attempt later and let me know how it goes.

Gave them the offline patcher as they requested it.


UPDATE 23/04/2025

Client got back to me after the server and client upgrade and stated that the issue is the same.

UPDATE 24/04/2025

Connected remote to the client's machine to troubleshoot the case.
They have installed the EPP v6.2.4.2000 on the endpoint and they were getting the same error in VS Code when they were trying to run the piece of code where as while the EPP was not installed, the code was running successfully.

Currently the problematic machine did not had any CAP policies assigned and DPI was completely disabled.

We ran it first like that but the same error came up. Afterwards I enabled the DPI and also stealthy DPI and tried again but that didn't seem to help.

They said this is the only machine that had this issue and I asked to show me an example of another machine where this is not happening and what I have noticed on the machine where the issue is not happening that it had MTP scanning and Meta data enabled under computer settings.

We enabled that and restarted the machine again but it was not working as the same error came up.

Checked the eppclient.log and hooking.enable was equal to 1.

At some point, we lost the connectivity with the client and they did not respond at all through Zoom nor through the Zoom chat.

Waited about 25 minutes while I was still checking things but after seeing no sign of responses and neither through the mail I closed out.

Inisde the Advanced Scanning Exceptions they had VSCode added but just as ''VSCode'' not ''VSCode.exe''. I wanted to add but I didn't get their permission as it might have affected other devices too.



UPDATE 24/04/2025

Connected remote to take a look at the case.
Mohammed added VSCode.exe inside the Advanced Scanning Exceptions but that didn't help as the same error was showing up.(Attached it to the sharepoint.

Wanted to screenrecord the issue to exemplify better but client refused to record the problem as it is a sensitive content for them that they need to protect.

Ran a debug log and asked Mohammed to provide the logs in about 30-40 minutes.

Connected remote to troubleshoot the case furtther.
First we installed the  https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp31032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.0114.zip
 as suggested but it just kept not connecting to their endpoint server.
Eventually we installed the official 6.2.4.2000 but we could not test as the end user was not available to check.
Also took a look at the computer settings and DPI along with MTP scanning were off.

Advised the client to reach out to me once the users test out the case and let me know.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-20T07:34:20.000Z"

Will sent note over with instructions.

Update 28/04/2025

Spoke with T2 in regards of the case and got advised to perform the following:

1.Install the below upgraded version:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp31032025/EppClient_v6.2.4.0114.zip
2. Removed the MTP scanning option as it seems like from the collected logs there are a lot of entries with hooking not supported for VSCode.exe and Code.exe even though both were whitelisted in the advanced exceptions.

2.Will send a follow up  asking to reschedule.
