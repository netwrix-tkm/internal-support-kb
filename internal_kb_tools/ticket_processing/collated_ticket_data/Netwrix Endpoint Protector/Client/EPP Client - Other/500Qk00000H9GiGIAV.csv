We are having an issue with one of our endpoints connecting to Endpoint Protector. On our side, the device is online, we can ping it, and it is being detected by all of our security tools as being online and in use; though when we look at Endpoint Protector, the device is showing and licenced and offline, meaning that we cannot assign any access to New USB Devices, due to the user not receiving new policies, even when forcing the policies to update by right clicking on the icon.

Would it be possible to check on your side of things to see if there are any issues, and if there is any troubleshooting that can be done?

As of now, I have tried:
- Restarting the device
- Uninstalling and reinstalling Endpoint Protector Version 6.2.3.1 on the device
- Syncing all policies

The Device identifier is mb14012, should you need this. It is also worth noting that I work in our IT Security team, and this device is a part of another team, at another site, meaning that I do not have physical access to the device, so would need to ask other users to troubleshoot any issues that require physical solutions (ie not remoting onto the device, or using any tools to perform actions)

Many Thanks,
Conor","","","","third party app blocking the connection","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","63.8","Closed - Resolved","Martin-Baker","Conor Lane","2024-10-17T10:41:22.000Z","2024-12-20T06:57:16.000Z"
