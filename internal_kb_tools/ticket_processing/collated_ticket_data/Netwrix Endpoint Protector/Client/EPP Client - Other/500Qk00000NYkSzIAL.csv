We are not getting any CAP logs, kindly do the needful on priority basis, we are creating monitor policy but blocking the apps and urls.

Please run te SQL DB for fetching the CAP reports on priority.

Regards,
Sai.","","Customer encounter an issue with the CAP logs that are not being received in the EPP UI console.

Customer have two CAP policies one for MacOS and one for Windows.","We have requested more details regarding the issue.

We had a remote session with the customer where we assist them with the denylist dictionaries that the had created and not working, and also with their google business accounts. In this session we handled their CAP issues for the Windows machines.

A new remote session will be scheduled for the next week to check also their MacOS machines that encounter the same issues.

In the meeting we have successfully solved the URL denylist which is not being blocked correctly.
Also, we have update the client to the 6.2.4.2 version, enable DPI for Microsoft Teams and include it as an exit point to the CAP policy.
This steps helped us have a clean view of the reports generated by the policy when a file is transferred through Teams app.

We have agreed to schedule a new session tomorrow at 12:30 IST to investigate the issues related to the MacOS machines.

The meeting details will be sent in a separate email.","solved in the remote session","","Daniel Anton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","6.8","Closed - Resolved","Satcom Infotech","Sai Nachiappan","2025-04-01T12:48:19.000Z","2025-04-08T07:50:40.000Z"
