In the meeting we have successfully solved the URL denylist which is not being blocked correctly.
Also, we have update the client to the 6.2.4.2 version, enable DPI for Microsoft Teams and include it as an exit point to the CAP policy.
This steps helped us have a clean view of the reports generated by the policy when a file is transferred through Teams app.

We have agreed to schedule a new session tomorrow at 12:30 IST to investigate the issues related to the MacOS machines.

The meeting details will be sent in a separate email.","","","","005Qk000001nVi3IAE","2025-04-07T09:16:15.000Z"
