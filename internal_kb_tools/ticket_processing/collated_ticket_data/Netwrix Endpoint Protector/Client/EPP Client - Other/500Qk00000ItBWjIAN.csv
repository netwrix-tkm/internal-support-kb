"500Qk00000ItBWjIAN","00428409","Support Ticket","URLs not getting whitelisted - ||DIABOS||","The user has issues with 2 websites whose processes are getting blocked by EPP client.
1. <a href='https://business.moneycorp.com/exchange-currency' target='_blank'>business.moneycorp.com/exchange-currency</a>
This website has a tool that converts currencies in realtime, as soon as we apply CAP policy on the machine, the tool stop working and returns an error. The website itself is not getting blocked, the tool on the website stops working, there is no log of what URL is getting blocked by the EPP client, hence I have exported the log of the machine when the machine was having CAP policy and when the machine was taken out of CAP policy and the tool started working (screenshot and logs attached.)

2. <a href='https://figma.com/files/team' target='_blank'>figma.com/files/team</a>
This website does not load correctly after logging in, removing the machine from the CAP policy enables the website to run smoothly, in this case, no logs are generated in the server.","","","","Issue was resolved in a remote session.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","19.8","Closed - Resolved","J M BAXI GROUP","Prasanth Ganesan","2024-11-28T10:55:27.000Z","2024-12-18T06:43:12.000Z"
