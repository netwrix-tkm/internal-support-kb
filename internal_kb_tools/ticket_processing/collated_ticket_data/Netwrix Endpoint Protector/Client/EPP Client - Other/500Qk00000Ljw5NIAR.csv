"500Qk00000Ljw5NIAR","00435386","Support Ticket","Add the possibility to check if the macOS EPP Network extension is enabled","Hello,

Customer name is RubyPlay.
Could you please look into the possibility of checking if the macOS EPP Network extension is enabled/disabled on the endpoint?
We know that currently EPP has a function to provide some action if the Network extension is disabled, but it would be really helpful if customer will be able to see on which macOS computers this extension wasn't allowed.","","The customer wanted a method that they can use to check if the EPP network extension is installed and enabled.","The customer can check this by running the following command in terminal ""systemextensionsctl list"", this will list all the Network / System extensions.  For Endpoint Protector it will show ""activated"" and ""enabled"" when the extension is installed and enabled.","The customer can check this by running the following command in terminal ""systemextensionsctl list"", this will list all the Network / System extensions.
