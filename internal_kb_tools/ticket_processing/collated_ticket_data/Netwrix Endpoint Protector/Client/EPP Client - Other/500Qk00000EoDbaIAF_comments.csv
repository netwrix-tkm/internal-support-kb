After discussing the problem with the team, please first take the following steps:

	 - 	 enable the ""Virtual Desktop Clones Support"" option from System Configuration -> System Settings page
	 - 	 reregister all the machines;

If this didn't fix the problem, please try to filter the machines after the machine name (provide a screenshot)

Proceed with the steps from the previous comment.
