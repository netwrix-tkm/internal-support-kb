After installing the EPP client on a customer server, I am experiencing an issue. 

The EPP Client - Server IP and Port settings are set to “Not set”, so normal communication is not possible. 

I am attaching the debug log and related screenshots. 
Please check the workaround for this issue. 

Notes: The customer is in an airgapped environment, so remote support is not possible.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-06T04:05:10.000Z"
