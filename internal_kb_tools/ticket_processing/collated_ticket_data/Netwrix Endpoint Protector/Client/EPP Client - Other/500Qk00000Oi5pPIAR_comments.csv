Hello,
@WaitingOnEngineer

I managed to reproduce this on my Windows machine, too. I took a look in the User Manual, and according to it, Bluetooth should be allowed in Transparent mode. I also tested on Mac, and there the Bluetooth was operable in Transparent mode, as it should be based on the User Manual.

I prepared a test build with a fix. Please use it and provide feedback. With this fix, Bluetooth should work in Transparent Mode.

The test build is located at: \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_05_26EppClient_v6.2.5.0021

Can we have a download link for this build, please? @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan

Thank you!

The test build fixed the issues, BT and audio work correctly now, only other device types are getting blocked.
