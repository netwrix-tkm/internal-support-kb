After installing the EPP client on a customer server, I am experiencing an issue. 

The EPP Client - Server IP and Port settings are set to “Not set”, so normal communication is not possible. 

I am attaching the debug log and related screenshots. 
Please check the workaround for this issue. 

Notes: The customer is in an airgapped environment, so remote support is not possible.","","","","After several attempts, I installed client version 5.8.2.5 and
and confirmed that it is communicating normally.

We will reopen the case at a later date.","","Andrei Pop","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","13.1","Closed - Resolved","VicCnS Co.,Ltd.","kwangjae shin","2025-03-06T04:05:10.000Z","2025-03-19T06:57:36.000Z"
