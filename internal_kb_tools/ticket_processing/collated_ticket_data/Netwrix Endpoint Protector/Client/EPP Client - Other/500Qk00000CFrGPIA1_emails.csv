Can you please collect a set of logs following the steps below?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
4.c. Select Create Appended Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Restart the computer.
7. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
8. Confirm the service is stopping.
9. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
10. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Hi Andrei Pop,

The endpoint has falcon agent, versa agent. We have almost 1800 endpoints in our environment, only few are facing this issue. Rest of the endpoints are working fine.

Hello,

To confirm this. The issue is on a small number of computers whereas other computers with the agent installed don't have this issue?

Hi Andrei Pop,

We wanted to inform you that we have successfully uninstalled the Versa agent. Currently, both versa, crowdstrke agents are installed globally. With the exception of a few endpoints, the EPP clients on other endpoints are functioning smoothly.

Hi Andrei Pop,
It appears that only a few agents are being affected by the current issue. However, due to the large number of agents (approximately 1800), we are unable to manually check each one to confirm the extent of the impact.

Hi Andrei Pop,

It appears that only a few agents are being affected by the current issue. However, due to the large number of agents (approximately 1800), we are unable to manually check each one to confirm the extent of the impact.

Hi Andrei Pop,

We wanted to inform you that we have successfully uninstalled the Versa agent. Currently, both versa, crowdstrke agents are installed globally. With the exception of a few endpoints, the EPP clients on other endpoints are functioning smoothly.

Hi Andrei Pop,

The endpoint has falcon agent, versa agent. We have almost 1800 endpoints in our environment, only few are facing this issue. Rest of the endpoints are working fine.

And on the exception where Versa and Crowd strike are uninstalled the Epp is working ok?

On a computer where this is happening is it possible to stop both to see if the issue remains?

Kind regards

Hi Andrei Pop,

It appears that only a few agents are being affected by the current issue. However, due to the large number of agents (approximately 1800), we are unable to manually check each one to confirm the extent of the impact.

We wanted to inform you that we have successfully uninstalled the Versa agent. Currently, both versa, crowdstrke agents are installed globally. With the exception of a few endpoints, the EPP clients on other endpoints are functioning smoothly.

 

Regards,

 

Muthamil Selvan M

Does the issue resolve whne Versa is uninstalled? Can Crowsdstrike be uninstalled on the test computer as well?

Kind regards

Hello,

To confirm this. The issue is on a small number of computers whereas other computers with the agent installed don't have this issue?

Kind regards
