"500Qk00000O1vMeIAJ","00441933","Support Ticket","Certain domains are slow with Endpoint Protector enabled","Hi.
We are currently having issues with our Mac endpoints. Once we install Endpoint Protector on a Mac system, some domains (for example atlassian) has load times of 30+ seconds. After removing EEP from affected systems, loading times drastically go down (4-6 seconds, depending on the hardware). We tested as much as we could on all OS, and only Mac is having this issue. We would like to set up a meeting, where we could show our case live, and discuss potential fixes.","","Customer is facing slowness when trying to access websites","A remote session will be scheduled in order to investigate
The customer used about 1000 urls for the url deny list. There were some duplicates in the list and the customers are going to review the deny lists.
Also a set of logs will be collected during the next week so we can investigate what can be improved on our side.
Checking with the customer if they still have issues after removing some of the unnecessary urls from the denylist","Too many urls are included in the URL denylist dictionary","Other","Emil Podar","Performance","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","21.1","Closed - Resolved","Tradebyte Software GmbH","Paulius Tunkevicius","2025-04-14T14:19:41.000Z","2025-05-05T15:35:41.000Z"
