Hey Daniel,

Sorry for the delay - I could not get through to the user but by pure coincidence I had another user with the same issue today that was more helpful so I got them on a call and followed the steps above.

Attached to the ticket should be ""Archive.zip"" that contains the logs that you asked for.

Hopefully this has been done right, if I need to do anything else and resend, please let me know.

Please note that I had also tried getting them to manually update their policy before calling them, but forgot to ask them to do this whilst capturing the logs.

Kind Regards,
Conor","Netwrix Support Ticket #424220 - Endpoint Offline","clane@martin-baker.co.uk","Conor Lane","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-05T13:15:43.000Z","true"

Hi Daniel,

I hope all is well?

Is there any update available for this, please?

I have noticed that more devices are now not regularly checking-in with the server (even my own) and we are unable to access the Admin Portal when we are working on our own network. 

I have checked with our networking and firewall teams and the traffic appears to be leaving our network/firewall but nothing appears to happen after that in some cases.

I have a call with our firewall team and Andrei Pop from Netwrix tomorrow at 11am GMT about ticket 00418849 which is similar to this, if you wanted to join?

Thank you for getting back to us. 

I have checked the logs and found a few errors when the client tried to sent the logs to the client, which failed due to curl error 28 . 
Tomorrow, I will also join in the meeting with Andrei, and check the issue that you encounter.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

Thank you so much for joining the call earlier, your support was greatly appreciated! Apologies that Reliance Cyber (Our Firewall Provider) ran most of the meeting, though I believe we may be making good progress with these tickets (424220 and 418849)!

As discussed, if you wouldn’t mind checking with your Dev’s to see if our Public IP is being blocked and classed as a Denial of Service due to the number of packets being sent, that would be great.

We will await a response from the Devs that may be able to investigate further.

In terms of moving forwards, I can now seemingly access the Web Admin Dashboard again and start to process requests, but with the Endpoints not being able to connect to the server, this is leaving us still unable to process requests, as we have had new cameras delivered that have not been detected by endpoint protector once plugged in, (as the client has been unable to check-in and give these identifiers)

Would it be worth updating (at least) ticket 00424220 to Critical? By definition we believe it may fit that category, with the software being effectively inoperable in most cases, with updates to permissions not being picked up?

Many thanks again for your help, if there is anything further that is needed, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

Thank you for your time in today's session .

We will need to investigate further the situation encountered with the clients. 

If all of them will have the same messages, then we need to fix the firewall /blockage issue. 

We can schedule a remote session Thursday to check the situation.

Looking forward for your response.

Hey Daniel,

Just to update you - I am now no longer able to access the Endpoint Protector Server UI, so I cannot issue OTPs to users anymore.

As there is no workaround in place at the moment, do I need to escalate the severity of this case?

Thank you for your prompt response.

I have checked the server backend and the services are up and running, the page is accessible, but you have SSO enabled and I'm not part of your organisation.

Could you please check with your network team?

The changes you refer to that were made on your computer, were they made at your network level, or from the Endpoint Protector UI?

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Cristian,

Thanks for stepping in for Daniel.

The changes that we made were at a Firewall Level (which we have external providers for) as we suspected that our firewall stopped us communicating with the CoSoSys Server.

The Change that was implemented was an exception that allowed all traffic from my computer to go directly to the CoSoSys Server without being inspected and blocked - This worked for a day but now I have gone back to losing full access again.

For Context, I work within the Security Team at my company so provide access to the various devices that our employees request.

Thank you for getting back to us.

Have you tried to access the EPP UI from another network ? 

As I mentioned last evening the server is up and running, but the SSO is blocking me from accessing the page.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

I have tried to access this on my phone - Using Mobile Data and I can reach the Microsoft Sign-in page (which I can't use my account for as it is not onboarded) so believe the issue will not be present there.

Whilst that could suggest a network issue, I believe that may not also rule out the Web-Application Firewall?

Thank you for getting back to us. 

Can you please access it from your computer by connecting to another network? 

We are not blocking the access to the console, this is the configuration from your firewall and cannot be modified by us.

Have aa nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel, 

I can go back again and check with our external firewall provider. Would it be possible to confirm what needs to be allowed from a technical standpoint to get the Endpoints to connect to the Server and update in the Web Dashboard?

Also do these requirements change from those needed for me to access the Web Dashboard in terms of URLs, Port Numbers, IP Addresses that need to be whitelisted?

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for your prompt response,

Just to confirm, should our firewall be configured to allow traffic to 'h6i313b.hosted.endpointprotector.com' port 443, or '3.9.47.175' port 443 (or both)

When we look at our Web UI, h6i313b.hosted.endpointprotector.com is listed in the Server IP field, though 3.9.47.175 I presume would be better?
