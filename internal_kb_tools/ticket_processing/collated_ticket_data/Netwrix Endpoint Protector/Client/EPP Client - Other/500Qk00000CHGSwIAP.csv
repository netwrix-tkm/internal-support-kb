We detected an unusual situation with one of our existing customers who reported many false positives for Brazilian PIIs. (we also have an escalated case for this)

Lucas (<a href='https://lucas.cavalcante@fcbrasil.com.br' target='_blank'>lucas.cavalcante@fcbrasil.com.br</a>), who did many EPP installations, and the ESCALE project owner, Tiago (<a href='https://tiago@securegate.com.br' target='_blank'>tiago@securegate.com.br</a>) tested this and saw different behaviors on different servers.


Thiago has access to the Customer's environment(ESCALE), and with all the configurations he made, the customer always reported Many false positives. (Customer has SaaS, but Thiago also tested on his on-prem environment with the same results)

Lucas created in his test environment the same policy and tested with the same files, but he did not have that many false positives, and the policy worked as expected (Onprem)

Can we please examine these two servers and determine what is missing from Thiago's Environment?

The customer is already losing patience. He hasn't used the solution correctly for six months and has a very important audit soon. Knowing that policy is working in other environments gives us a chance to apply corrections and easily de-escalate the ticket we have there for months.

Many thanks!
