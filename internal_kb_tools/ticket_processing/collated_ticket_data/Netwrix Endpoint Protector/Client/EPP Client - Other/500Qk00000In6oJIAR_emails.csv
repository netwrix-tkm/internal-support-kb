Hello,

For network share, if you access it from the explorer, the allowlist should work without DPI.
You should be able to add the network share location and select the computers you want to apply it to.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection and try to set it up together.

Kind regards

Hello,

For network share, if you access it from the explorer, the allowlist should work without DPI.
You should be able to add the network share location and select the computers you want to apply it to.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection and try to set it up together.

Kind regards

Hello,

For network share, if you access it from the explorer, the allowlist should work without DPI.
You should be able to add the network share location and select the computers you want to apply it to.
If you want we can schedule a remote connection and try to set it up together.

Kind regards
