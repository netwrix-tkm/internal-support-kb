Hi Andrei, 

The issue occurred as well this morning between10:37 and 10:40. 

It disappeared after that without me doing anything on the system : Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 12.14.18.png

I have this message on multiples times before 10:40 : ""connection not found in NAT state table""

Do you have any idea of what it can be ?

Good morning, 

I had the issue today with the version 3.0.3.1009 starting 8:50 until 9:00. 

I isolated the data from the log file called EPPSSLSPLIT.LOG and it appears that this famous message is very present during this timeframe

""007d7840 1276.589 Connection not found in NAT state table, aborting connection""

It doesn't appear before 8:50 and doesn't appear either after 9:00. 

If you could please check this file EPP-Logs-13-Nov-2024.log which is very small and contains relevant data

Hi Andrei,

I had again this issue this morning after a Chrome Update that required a restart of the browser between 8:50 and 9:00

I isolated the interesting part of the file ""eppsslsplit.log"" during the timeframe this issue occurred. You can notice that multiples times, the error is visible : 

""007d7840 1276.589 Connection not found in NAT state table, aborting connection""

The file name is : ""EPP-Logs-13-Nov-2024.log""

Hi Andrei,

For the moment it seems ok. However, this issue appears on my MacBook once a week and I’m not yet sure it’s completely fine. I will give you another feedback in 10 days.

Anyway, do you have any idea of what could be the reason of the error message I provided a few days ago ?

Hello Andrei,

Actually, I was off during the last 10 days so I couldn’t give any proper feedback.

However, I will let you know now that I’m back in the next few days if I encounter the problem again.

By the way, did you have the opportunity to check the logs I provided and that famous error ?  “Connection not found in NAT state table”

Ticket Number: 00420107
Ticket Subject: Certificate status switch to status Available = NO and Status = NO after restart for no reason
Ticket Details: Dear partner,

Since a few days we have for specific user S/N : LRLY71T09K a problem. It appears that suddenly in the morning he can't browse any website at all not matter what is the browser he uses (Safari, Firefox, Chrome). The pages keeps loading but ultimately get an error.

However, when i tried on his MacBook some command on the Terminal like CURL, PING -T or TRACEROUTE i was able to see some results and to reach the website destination.

After some time investigating, i finally noticed that the Certificate status of EndPoint Protector certificate status is now marked as NO and the Trusted status is NO but only in the client application. On the server side, the status of the certificate was marked as Trusted.

After a simple restart it worked fine and everything was back to normal. However after a few days the issue came back. Same behavior and same consequences. I investigated a bit more and tried to remove the Endpoint Protector transparent proxy and suddenly web browsing started to work again.

So it's definitly related to this. Immeditaly after removed the EP transparent proxy i had this pop-up telling me that EP wants to add Proxy configuration so that all network activity on this Mac could be filtered and monitored.

This user in our dashboard is called Matti’s MacBook Air and he has the same configuration as everyone one. We apply the same global policy to all of our users.

Do you have any idea of where it comes froms and how to solve it ? Also do you have any client which is impacted by this issue that appeared suddently ten days ago ?

Thank you!

Hello Andrei, 

 

Actually, I was off during the last 10 days so I couldn’t give any proper feedback. 

 

However, I will let you know now that I’m back in the next few days if I encounter the problem again.

 

By the way, did you have the opportunity to check the logs I provided and that famous error ?  “Connection not found in NAT state table”

 



 

Best Regards, 

Yacine
