@WaitingOnEngineer

This seems to be either a network issue or as you suspected, another product that is conflicting with the EPP client. Do they have any restrictions in their firewall or AV? I don't think there is anything that we can do on the EPP client side now. And probably the same is valid for the EPP server, judging by the error I don't think this reaches the server side either. Did they try to access the server interface from the browser? Does that work?Â 
I would recommend doing further tests with the latest production build. And do some tests without the products that could be conflicting with EPP (even though I understand they mentioned that they have the same products on each machine, but who knows, maybe they don't have the same settings)
