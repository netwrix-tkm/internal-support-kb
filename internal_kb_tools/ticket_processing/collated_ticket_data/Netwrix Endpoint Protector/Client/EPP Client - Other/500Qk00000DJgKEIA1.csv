"500Qk00000DJgKEIA1","00415560","Support Ticket","Users getting pop-up ""Scanning file: /var/tmp/epp/*.png""","Starting a few days ago, multiple users have received reports of getting pop-ups ""Scanning file: <a href='https:///var/tmp/epp/randomname.png' target='_blank'>/var/tmp/epp/randomname.png</a>"" when drafting emails in Gmail. The path appears to be related to Endpoint Protector. When we browse to that path there is nothing there, no .png file named after that.

I've tried a clean uninstall and reinstall of the EPP Client on these users devices but it comes back up. When looking at the EPP content aware logs nothing shows up. But somehow its still occuring. See screenshot.","","","","Mime type + OCR scan settings.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","54.7","Closed - Resolved","AutoFi","Jayme Villafranca","2024-07-19T21:42:04.000Z","2024-09-12T14:26:41.000Z"
