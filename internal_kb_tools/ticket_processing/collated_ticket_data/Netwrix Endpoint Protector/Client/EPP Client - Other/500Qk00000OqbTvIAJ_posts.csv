That is the same as the eppclient.log, except it does not empty out when the service is restarted. Those files were manually created by the support tool. I recommend disabling debug mode and removing any epp log files from the C drive. After a reboot, enable the debug mode again and see if the eppclient.log file populates.</p><p> </p><p>note: if the logs are needed, they can use the eppclient_append.log file.
