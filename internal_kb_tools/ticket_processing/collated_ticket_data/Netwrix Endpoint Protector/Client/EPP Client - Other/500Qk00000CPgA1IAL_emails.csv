Hi Andrei,


The below offline patch for Hotfix #1 you sent only includes the patch for server-side: the fixed EPPClients are not embedded in this one. I tested and applied this one each 3 VM machine right before but it was same one last week.
(https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz)

We need the patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients. The fixed EPPClients should be automatically deployed in the ‘System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade’ section.

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline ASAP?

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your fast reply.

Hi Andrei,

 

 

The issue with Hotfix #1 is rapidly spreading, and many customers are continuously pressuring our distributor. However, without a patch that includes the fixed EPPClients, it is challenging for engineers to manually deploy the fix to 1,000 to 10,000 clients individually, causing hesitation in patch deployment.

 

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline? This is an urgent situation, and we are asking once again.

 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your support.

Hi Andrei,


Could you kindly help me to make the new request building a new offline Hotfix #1 embedded with the fixed EPPClients?
This is a critical issue. Some government agencies would be monitoring this issue; we need to handle this one ASAP with a new offline patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients.
Now our engineers from direct distributors cannot apply the existed Hotfix #1 against the resistance of customers because they need to deploy each fixed client manually.

I apologize if my urgency caused any inconvenience, but I appreciate your understanding of the situation.

Have a nice day!
Please help us.

Hi Andrei,


The below offline patch for Hotfix #1 you sent only includes the patch for server-side: the fixed EPPClients are not embedded in this one. I tested and applied this one each 3 VM machine right before but it was same one last week.
(https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz)

We need the patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients. The fixed EPPClients should be automatically deployed in the ‘System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade’ section.

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline ASAP?

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your fast reply.


Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,


The issue with Hotfix #1 is rapidly spreading, and many customers are continuously pressuring our distributor. However, without a patch that includes the fixed EPPClients, it is challenging for engineers to manually deploy the fix to 1,000 to 10,000 clients individually, causing hesitation in patch deployment.

Hi Andrei,

 

 

Could you kindly help me to make the new request building a new offline Hotfix #1 embedded with the fixed EPPClients?

This is a critical issue. Some government agencies would be monitoring this issue; we need to handle this one ASAP with a new offline patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients.

Now our engineers from direct distributors cannot apply the existed Hotfix #1 against the resistance of customers because they need to deploy each fixed client manually.

 

I apologize if my urgency caused any inconvenience, but I appreciate your understanding of the situation.

 

Have a nice day!

Please help us.

 

 

Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,


We have identified 34 public sector clients as below, and over 85% of them use closed networks and are reluctant to accept remote support.

Due to these reasons, remote support might not be easy. If there is an urgent request from a private sector client, we will ask for remote support.
Could you please provide an approximate schedule of the offline patch for EPPClients again? Also, if the vulnerability issue is resolved in the next EPP version, could you let us know the timeline for that?

I apologize for the difficult request, but it is hard to convince the clients without an approximate schedule.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CPgA1:ref



Hi Andrei,

 

 

We have identified 34 public sector clients as below, and over 85% of them use closed networks and are reluctant to accept remote support.

 

Due to these reasons, remote support might not be easy. If there is an urgent request from a private sector client, we will ask for remote support. 

Could you please provide an approximate schedule of the offline patch for EPPClients again? Also, if the vulnerability issue is resolved in the next EPP version, could you let us know the timeline for that?

 

I apologize for the difficult request, but it is hard to convince the clients without an approximate schedule.



 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your support.

 

 

Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,

 

 

Could you kindly help me to make the new request building a new offline Hotfix #1 embedded with the fixed EPPClients?

This is a critical issue. Some government agencies would be monitoring this issue; we need to handle this one ASAP with a new offline patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients.

Now our engineers from direct distributors cannot apply the existed Hotfix #1 against the resistance of customers because they need to deploy each fixed client manually.

 

I apologize if my urgency caused any inconvenience, but I appreciate your understanding of the situation.

 

Have a nice day!

Please help us.

 

 

Best Regards,

Hello,

Currently, the Epp client with the fix is separate.
I doe't have a timeline for other offline patches.

Hi Andrei,

 

 

The below offline patch for Hotfix #1 you sent only includes the patch for server-side: the fixed EPPClients are not embedded in this one. I tested and applied this one each 3 VM machine right before but it was same one last week.

(https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz)

 

We need the patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients. The fixed EPPClients should be automatically deployed in the ‘System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade’ section.

 

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline ASAP? 

 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your fast reply.

Hi Andrei,

 

 

The issue with Hotfix #1 is rapidly spreading, and many customers are continuously pressuring our distributor. However, without a patch that includes the fixed EPPClients, it is challenging for engineers to manually deploy the fix to 1,000 to 10,000 clients individually, causing hesitation in patch deployment.

 

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline? This is an urgent situation, and we are asking once again.

 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your support.

 

 

 

Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,



Thank you for your information.
Could you prioritize this request if you and your team are available?

Many customers are calling to request the resolution of vulnerabilities, but we are at a standstill because we cannot manually distribute too many EPPClients.
Since the issue with vulnerabilities is a matter of time, I apologize for repeatedly making requests.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andrei,

 

 

 

Thank you for your information.

Could you prioritize this request if you and your team are available?

 

Many customers are calling to request the resolution of vulnerabilities, but we are at a standstill because we cannot manually distribute too many EPPClients.

Since the issue with vulnerabilities is a matter of time, I apologize for repeatedly making requests.

 

Have a nice day!

 

                 

Best Regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CPgA1:ref

 


Hi Andrei,

 

 

We have identified 34 public sector clients as below, and over 85% of them use closed networks and are reluctant to accept remote support.

 

Due to these reasons, remote support might not be easy. If there is an urgent request from a private sector client, we will ask for remote support. 

Could you please provide an approximate schedule of the offline patch for EPPClients again? Also, if the vulnerability issue is resolved in the next EPP version, could you let us know the timeline for that?

 

I apologize for the difficult request, but it is hard to convince the clients without an approximate schedule.



 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your support.

 

 

Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,

 

 

Could you kindly help me to make the new request building a new offline Hotfix #1 embedded with the fixed EPPClients?

This is a critical issue. Some government agencies would be monitoring this issue; we need to handle this one ASAP with a new offline patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients.

Now our engineers from direct distributors cannot apply the existed Hotfix #1 against the resistance of customers because they need to deploy each fixed client manually.

 

I apologize if my urgency caused any inconvenience, but I appreciate your understanding of the situation.

 

Have a nice day!

Please help us.

 

 

Best Regards,

Hi Andrei,

 

 

The below offline patch for Hotfix #1 you sent only includes the patch for server-side: the fixed EPPClients are not embedded in this one. I tested and applied this one each 3 VM machine right before but it was same one last week.

(https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/MP-HWA-EPP4-U8800.tar.gz)

 

We need the patch embedded with the fixed EPPClients. The fixed EPPClients should be automatically deployed in the ‘System Configuration > Client Software Upgrade’ section.

 

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline ASAP? 

 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your fast reply.

Hi Andrei,

 

 

The issue with Hotfix #1 is rapidly spreading, and many customers are continuously pressuring our distributor. However, without a patch that includes the fixed EPPClients, it is challenging for engineers to manually deploy the fix to 1,000 to 10,000 clients individually, causing hesitation in patch deployment.

 

Could you please share the availability of the patch we requested and a rough timeline? This is an urgent situation, and we are asking once again.

 

Have a nice day!

Thank you for your support.

 

 

 

Best Regards,
