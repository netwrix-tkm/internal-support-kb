"500Qk00000J8eGiIAJ","00428997","Support Ticket","Client reregistration possible?","As I had an issue with certificates a couple of weeks ago, I discovered, that about half of the clients still does not comunicate with the server. It also shows, the clients are unlicensed. Checking one of these clients I figured out, that when I'm trying to ""Update Policies now"" the icon in the tray is not blinking but on the settings tab of the client you find the information regarding client name, user name and administrator contac information. Any ideas how I can fix thes without having to reinstall the client. Basically I found out that you habe to uninstall with the option to remove everything and reinstall.
