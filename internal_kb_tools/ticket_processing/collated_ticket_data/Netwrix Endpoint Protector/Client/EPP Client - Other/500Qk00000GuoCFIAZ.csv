Customer name is PrivatBank.
They have 2 users who are complaining at Screen is blinking during the workday on macOS 14.7 endpoints.
After deleting EPP client seems like the situation started to be better, screen does not blink anymore.
So, the customer wanted to know if you received similar reports from other customers?
Also, what kind of logs customer should gather to investigate this issue?
Currently, they are trying to find out if the issue was EPP client or no.","","","","the issue could not be reproduced anymore","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","35.2","Closed - Resolved","CoreWin Distributor","Danylo Didenko","2024-10-11T10:49:06.000Z","2024-11-15T15:18:18.000Z"
