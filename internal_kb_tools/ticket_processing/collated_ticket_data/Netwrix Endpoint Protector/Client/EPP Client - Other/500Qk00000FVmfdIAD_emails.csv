Please let me know if the test build that I sent to you is working as expected.
If the issue can be reproduced with the test build we should schedule a remote session in order to investigate the issue and to collect a set of logs.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Agustin,

For the moment I would recommend to uninstall the current EPP Client from the machines and then to install the test build that I provided.

If everything works well on the few machines where this test agent is deployed, I can ask internally if this test build can be injected in the EPP Server in order to be able to deploy it to more users using System Configuration -> Client Software Upgrade.

Best regards,
Emil

Hello Emil,
Is it possible to update this through the dashboard (client software upgrade)?
Thanks.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #420409 - Post-Update Web Browsing Issues Report    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0FVmfd:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","agustin.llovet@stensul.com","","emil.podar@netwrix.com","false","2024-11-12T15:08:11.000Z","true"

Hello Emil, sorry for the late reply.

I haven't been able to try the test build, but all our users who are
working with the Deep Packet Inspection disabled have no problem browsing
webs with websocket protocol. We are just disabling that feature for now.

You can close the ticket if needed.
Thanks. Regards,
Agus
