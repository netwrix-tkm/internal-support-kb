Thank you for reaching out to us.
Have you tried clearing the cache of the browser or to use an incognito window? Does the same issue occur after a computer restart? Is the behavior the same?
Is this the only user that is affected by this scenario?

Best regards,

Hi,

We restarted the mac, tried cmd+shift+r on pages, tried incognito, tried enabling/disabling proxy, deleted certs from the browser store and disabled 'Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates'. Nothing worked except uninstalling EPP.

Thank you for your email.
Could you please tell me your availability for this week so that we can arrange a remote session via Zoom to further investigate this matter? 
For the remote session we will need to have access to the affected computer to generate a set of logs.
 
Have a nice day,
Best regards,
