Recently we noticed that EPP agent creates an Outbound Block QUIC rule in the local Windows FW on the endpoint. Apparently this has been a thing forever and went unnoticed.

Can you please confirm why EPP needs to create local Firewall rule? and If not necessary can we disable this process?

I am attaching the document with screenshot showinf that the EPP agent created local firewall on the host.

Thanks,
Parin","","the customer needs to know if we have a block rule for the QUIC protocol. As far as the documentation is concerned I only found a bug fix for Brave browser that indicates that there is one for Chrome and Edge.
I will seek confirmation from engineering.","waiting for an answer in the Teams group and tomorrow I am opening an R&D ticket for the question if I have no answer.","Official answer provided","Root Cause Unknown","Eduard Nut","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","67.8","Closed - Resolved","Canada Guaranty","Parinkumar Patel","2025-02-21T18:27:04.000Z","2025-04-30T12:46:49.000Z"
