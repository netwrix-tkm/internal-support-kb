Dear Ratnesh,

I would like to give you an update on this case since we received feedback from our R&D team.

The feedback received from our developers confirms the initial suspicion which I had and mentioned to you in my email on the 14th February.  This issue seems to be either a network issue or as I suspected, another product that is conflicting with the EPP client.
Do you have any restrictions in your firewall or AV applied to this computer?  judging by the errors in the logs we don't think there is an issue with the EPP client itself or with the EPP Server.
Can you confirm if you are able to access the EPP server interface from the web browser on this affected computer? 
Would it be possible to temporarily remove the antivirus and other software that could potentially interfere with the EPP client comms and to do some tests without these software products?  even though we understand that you mentioned that you have the same products on each machine, it could be possible that the software configuration settings for this machine is different.

Looking forward to your response.

Kind regards

Kindly revert as soon as possible so we can also insist the user provide details of the other issues and get them addressed.

Hi Ratnesh,

I have reviewed again the EPP client logs for both computers (the one that is working and the other that is not working), it is clear that there is something preventing the one computer from making contact with the EPP server.  I have submitted the logs to our developers for further analyzation but this does not seem like it is an issue that we can resolve from our side.  It seems to be caused by something within the customer's environment.  The configurations for the EPP clients are identical between the two computers, so it is not known by us what is preventing the one computer from making contact with the EPP Server.

I will let you know once I have received feedback from our R&D team.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Hi Ratnesh,

I have reviewed again the EPP client logs for both computers (the one that is working and the other that is not working), it is clear that there is something preventing the one computer from making contact with the EPP server.  I have submitted the logs to our developers for further analyzation but this does not seem like it is an issue that we can resolve from our side.  It seems to be caused by something within the customer's environment.  The configurations for the EPP clients are identical between the two computers, so it is not known by us what is preventing the one computer from making contact with the EPP Server.

I will let you know once I have received feedback from our R&D team.


Kind regards

 Dear Ratnesh,
 
 I would like to give you an update on this case since we received feedback from our R&D team.
 
 The feedback received from our developers confirms the initial suspicion which I had and mentioned to you in my email on the 14th February.  This issue seems to be either a network issue or as I suspected, another product that is conflicting with the EPP client.
 Do you have any restrictions in your firewall or AV applied to this computer?  judging by the errors in the logs we don't think there is an issue with the EPP client itself or with the EPP Server.
 Can you confirm if you are able to access the EPP server interface from the web browser on this affected computer? 
 Would it be possible to temporarily remove the antivirus and other software that could potentially interfere with the EPP client comms and to do some tests without these software products?  even though we understand that you mentioned that you have the same products on each machine, it could be possible that the software configuration settings for this machine is different.
 
 Looking forward to your response.
 
 Kind regards
