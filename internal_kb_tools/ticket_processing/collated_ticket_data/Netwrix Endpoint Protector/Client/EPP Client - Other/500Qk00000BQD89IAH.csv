"500Qk00000BQD89IAH","00410916","Support Ticket","New feature seems not working","Our customer AB Concept updated its EPP server firmware to 5.9.3.0. recently. But they said they could not use the function of the “Re-read rights and settings for all computers” and the “Re-read client devices for all computers”. Since these are the new features, we have no idea how to proper use them. Could you please advise us how to help the customer to test them and to make sure they work.","","","","fixed","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","127.0","Closed - Resolved","IT Webster Limited","Support IT Webster","2024-06-04T10:29:45.000Z","2024-10-09T11:36:23.000Z"
