We are working on a policy that would report if somebody uploads files to a specific Sharepoint. We have our policy set to report only, however the Sharepoint website is getting blocked entirely by EPP. We are using DPI so not sure if is causing the issues. Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-24T21:17:05.000Z"
