Hi Jay,

Unfortunately there is no beta client for this case as it represents a Feature Request.

Hi

 

Regarding EPP's support for WOA, is there a beta client agent?

Or do you have any information to provide?

Thank you for your email.
It will depend on a consolidation list for roadmap, we do not have an ETA on this for now.
As mentioned, there is already a ticket that you created set on the Feature request, is it ok for us to close the one from here so that these are not duplicates?
