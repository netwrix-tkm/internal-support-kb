We have another issue with Airpak. After setting up the custom notifications on the server the notifications at end users end do not show up. Only the usual notifications show up. When I did the test on my computer it worked well.
Could we check that as well during the today session?

Thank you,
Stefania","","","","title was missing from the custom notification setup","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Airpak","Stefania Oltean","2024-08-07T16:00:34.000Z","2024-08-07T16:39:26.000Z"
