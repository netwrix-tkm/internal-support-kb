The PrivatBank customer investigating and started debug logging. When downloading the log file, we encountered the problem that the <a href='https://eppclient.log' target='_blank'>eppclient.log</a> file was empty.
We have  try to recreate but were enabled. 


Please find attached a screenshot of the zip file with logs.","","06-05 The PrivatBank customer investigating and started debug logging. When downloading the log file, we encountered the problem that the file was empty.

07-05 We have requested more details regarding this case and a screenshot. 

08-05 We start the investigation of the scenario.

14-05 We involved our T2 support .

15-05 We have analyse the case internally and we found that in the screenshot from the C drive shows the presence of the eppclient_append.log file.
That is the same as the eppclient.log, except it does not empty out when the service is restarted.
Those files were manually created by the support tool.
I recommend disabling debug mode and removing any epp.log files from the C drive.
After a reboot, enable the debug mode again and see if the eppclient.log file populates.","07-05 Waiting for customer to provide details.
