Client reported that the issue came back and wants to set up another remote session.

Client did not make a snapshot of his VM therefore we could not carry on with the troubleshooting.
Asked to investigate this on their side and let us know once it's done.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-12T10:21:44.000Z"

Connected remote along with Adrian to take a look at the problem.
This time on his server about 94% of the root was occupied by 34 GB file.

Connected remote along with Adrian to sort the issue.
This time, the occupied storage was inside the log /usr , not the shadows.
Went on and removed the unnecessary files that had around 48 GB  and also removed the banner that kept coming up.
Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-05-21T12:14:59.000Z"
