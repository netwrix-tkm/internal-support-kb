Hello, could not reproduce this issue on our side. Is it possible for you to send us the client logs for the computer in question? And a screenshot of the time zone set for that computer. Thank you.

Hello, 

I tried reproducing this issue with the 623.3001 windows client on 720+1334.

The only time I managed to generate logs from the future was when I changed the Windows time on my computer to 2055.
According to the attachments from this ticket, this issue occurred only on one day on each of those 3 computers, so I don't think this is the issue, but might worth asking the customer.

I also tried the following:

	 - 	Changed the Region, the language to Germany on the computer; 
	 - 	Tried with a different time zone on the server;
	 - 	I tried generating logs while being offline, set all devices to Allow / Deny

however, the issue did not reproduce on the QA side.


Please let me know if I can help with any more information.

We investigated this issue at BMW and found out that no logs from the future are being sent, and the computers that have logs from the future, now are logging with event_time_local correct which means the computer date was changed when those logs were made.
@Alin Anca pls verify with the client if we can close the issue because it is not reproducible anymore on their env.

the customer has checked on his side and the problem still exists. The number of events go down, but some clients still generate events in the future.

e. g. LSJP240283, LPTP2051013

@WaitingOnEngineer The EPP agent code gets the client event time using directly a Windows API (GetSystemTime), without any interpretation. In this case, it would be helpful to have the Windows Event Viewer logs (eventvwr.msc) for ""Windows Logs -> System"" for the specified date ranges. Unsuccessful synchronization with either RTC or NTP servers might cause an incorrect UTC time and this should be logged by the OS itself.
