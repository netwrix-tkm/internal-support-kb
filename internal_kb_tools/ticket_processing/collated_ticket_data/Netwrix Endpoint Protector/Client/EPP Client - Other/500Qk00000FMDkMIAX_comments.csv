The same problem occurred today at 10:03 and 10:06 for a few minutes after he had to restart chrome for an update. Firefox was impacted as well. Couldn't HTTP browse for 2-3 minutes and then it came back without him doing anything special.

I noticed the errors in the last attached screenshot, and based on that I think that the customer should try with a 5.9.4.1 RC build that has fixes many DPI issues caused by the macOS network extension.

so is this fixed with the 5.0.4.1003 agent?

This is a log from the old agents that had the bug, it doesn't affect the communication between the EPP agent and server, it affected DPI though.
