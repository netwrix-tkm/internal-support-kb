I have analyzed the logs along with our engineering, and there are no errors in how it works and how we detect content. The reason you are receiving the error is simply that when you create a build, it generates a huge amount of files which are accessed by rsync. That translates to EPP checking those files. What we suggest is either remove rsync from the policy(ies) or have a special policy without it that you can assign users when they need to use rsync.
As for the link you sent, I will provide it to our dev teams and see how it can be adjusted in EPP. 
Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

Hello Eduard,

I’m trying to understand the information below: does this mean that EPP is no longer able to monitor RSYNC and will not do this moving forward?

If this is the case, we need a confirmation so that this is passed up to Management as RSYNC is an exfiltration channel of interest for us.

Also, a few additional questions:

Wes the Cososys Dev team aware of the change done to RSYNC recently? (the information was sent to you by Denis)
Was there any measure taken in order to address the RSYNC change or is there anything planned?

I am asking these questions as we are now forced to exclude RSYNC from our monitored channels without any visibility as to if this is something that will be fixed by Cososys or not. It’s clear this is connected to the latest MacOS update.

Thank you,

Rsync is still being monitored, and I will confirm this, but I do not think there are any plans to drop Rsync monitoring from EPP. Your use case however is just creating a lot of files to be inspected for sensitive data and Rsync having no timeout will cause this issue.
Simply put, Rsync does not wait for us to inspect the huge amount of files and fails.
As for the other questions, I do not have an answer yet for what is to come in regards to the changes coming to Rsync, but that is something I will inquire about and provide you with an answer. Just bear in mind that being a question, this will take some time. 
Please let me know if you have follow-up questions at this time.

Hello,

 

One of the users noticed that there has been an update to rsync, connected to the latest Mac update. Here is the link to the article:  https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2025/04/06/rsync-replaced-with-openrsync-on-macos-sequoia/ It might be helpful with troubleshooting the problem.

 

Kind regards,

Denis

Hello Denis,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please check if the ""RSYNC"" is selected as exit point in the CAP policy assigned to the affected endpoints ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Here is the content of the update provided:

Rsync is still being monitored, and I will confirm this, but I do not think there are any plans to drop Rsync monitoring from EPP. Your use case however is just creating a lot of files to be inspected for sensitive data and Rsync having no timeout will cause this issue.
Simply put, Rsync does not wait for us to inspect the huge amount of files and fails.
As for the other questions, I do not have an answer yet for what is to come in regards to the changes coming to Rsync, but that is something I will inquire about and provide you with an answer. Just bear in mind that being a question, this will take some time.

Hello Eduard,

 

I’m trying to understand the information below: does this mean that EPP is no longer able to monitor RSYNC and will not do this moving forward?

 

If this is the case, we need a confirmation so that this is passed up to Management as RSYNC is an exfiltration channel of interest for us.

 

Also, a few additional questions:

 

Wes the Cososys Dev team aware of the change done to RSYNC recently? (the information was sent to you by Denis)

Was there any measure taken in order to address the RSYNC change or is there anything planned?

 

I am asking these questions as we are now forced to exclude RSYNC from our monitored channels without any visibility as to if this is something that will be fixed by Cososys or not. It’s clear this is connected to the latest MacOS update.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I have analyzed the logs along with our engineering, and there are no errors in how it works and how we detect content. The reason you are receiving the error is simply that when you create a build, it generates a huge amount of files which are accessed by rsync. That translates to EPP checking those files. What we suggest is either remove rsync from the policy(ies) or have a special policy without it that you can assign users when they need to use rsync.
As for the link you sent, I will provide it to our dev teams and see how it can be adjusted in EPP. 
Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hello Eduard,

I do have one additional question: How is rsync still being monitored efficiently if EPP is unable to scan the information uploaded to it and blocks any build attempt? This is not an isolated case, it applies to all Mac users trying to work with rsync at this time.

All our MacOS users are deeming rsync unusable now as they are unable to perform builds using Xcode anymore because of EPP.

I am re-emphasizing that this is an issue that appeared after the latest MacOS update and it’s clear that this is not the expected behavior from EPP as there were no issues until the update.

@oana.nemes@netwrix.com<mailto:oana.nemes@netwrix.com>: can you please make sure that this issue is addressed. Please let me know if you need anything else from our side.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

I’m trying to understand the information below: does this mean that EPP is no longer able to monitor RSYNC and will not do this moving forward?

 

If this is the case, we need a confirmation so that this is passed up to Management as RSYNC is an exfiltration channel of interest for us.

 

Also, a few additional questions:

 

Wes the Cososys Dev team aware of the change done to RSYNC recently? (the information was sent to you by Denis)

Was there any measure taken in order to address the RSYNC change or is there anything planned?

 

I am asking these questions as we are now forced to exclude RSYNC from our monitored channels without any visibility as to if this is something that will be fixed by Cososys or not. It’s clear this is connected to the latest MacOS update.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I have analyzed the logs along with our engineering, and there are no errors in how it works and how we detect content. The reason you are receiving the error is simply that when you create a build, it generates a huge amount of files which are accessed by rsync. That translates to EPP checking those files. What we suggest is either remove rsync from the policy(ies) or have a special policy without it that you can assign users when they need to use rsync.
As for the link you sent, I will provide it to our dev teams and see how it can be adjusted in EPP. 
Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hello,

 

One of the users noticed that there has been an update to rsync, connected to the latest Mac update. Here is the link to the article:  https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2025/04/06/rsync-replaced-with-openrsync-on-macos-sequoia/ It might be helpful with troubleshooting the problem.

 

Kind regards,

Denis

Hello Denis,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please check if the ""RSYNC"" is selected as exit point in the CAP policy assigned to the affected endpoints ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Eduard,

 

I do have one additional question: How is rsync still being monitored efficiently if EPP is unable to scan the information uploaded to it and blocks any build attempt? This is not an isolated case, it applies to all Mac users trying to work with rsync at this time.

 

All our MacOS users are deeming rsync unusable now as they are unable to perform builds using Xcode anymore because of EPP.

 

I am re-emphasizing that this is an issue that appeared after the latest MacOS update and it’s clear that this is not the expected behavior from EPP as there were no issues until the update. 

 

@oana.nemes@netwrix.com: can you please make sure that this issue is addressed. Please let me know if you need anything else from our side.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I did provide an update right before you sent the request. My apologies, I did not notice that you and the others were not in CC.
Here is the content of the update provided:

Rsync is still being monitored, and I will confirm this, but I do not think there are any plans to drop Rsync monitoring from EPP. Your use case however is just creating a lot of files to be inspected for sensitive data and Rsync having no timeout will cause this issue.
Simply put, Rsync does not wait for us to inspect the huge amount of files and fails.
As for the other questions, I do not have an answer yet for what is to come in regards to the changes coming to Rsync, but that is something I will inquire about and provide you with an answer. Just bear in mind that being a question, this will take some time. 
Please let me know if you have follow-up questions at this time.

Thank you,

Hello,

 

One of the users noticed that there has been an update to rsync, connected to the latest Mac update. Here is the link to the article:  https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2025/04/06/rsync-replaced-with-openrsync-on-macos-sequoia/ It might be helpful with troubleshooting the problem.

 

Kind regards,

Denis

Hello Denis,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please check if the ""RSYNC"" is selected as exit point in the CAP policy assigned to the affected endpoints ? 

Looking forward for your response.

The issue is caused by rsync which is checked in the CAP policy. From the logs we could see more than 14000 scans and almost all of them are rsync related.
When the user is building apps with Xcode and in this process, rsync is used to copy files from one location to another (the files that are built/generated are the ones copied). If rsync is checked in the policy (and it is) the EPP client has to scan the files. If there is any confidential content in the files, the files will be blocked. So, the file copy will fail and eventually the build will fail as well.

As this is the expected behavior of the EPP Client in this situation where rsync is monitored by the EPP Client, our dev's recommendation would be to remove rsync from the policy assigned to developers.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Andrei,

I asked our engineering team and they said there are no plans to drop support for Rsync. In fact, since the process names are the same, everything should work the same.
As for the issue at hand, they are still investigating all the info and logs provided and will get back to you once there is an update.

Hello Eduard,

 

I do have one additional question: How is rsync still being monitored efficiently if EPP is unable to scan the information uploaded to it and blocks any build attempt? This is not an isolated case, it applies to all Mac users trying to work with rsync at this time.

 

All our MacOS users are deeming rsync unusable now as they are unable to perform builds using Xcode anymore because of EPP.

 

I am re-emphasizing that this is an issue that appeared after the latest MacOS update and it’s clear that this is not the expected behavior from EPP as there were no issues until the update. 

 

@oana.nemes@netwrix.com: can you please make sure that this issue is addressed. Please let me know if you need anything else from our side.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I did provide an update right before you sent the request. My apologies, I did not notice that you and the others were not in CC.
Here is the content of the update provided:

Rsync is still being monitored, and I will confirm this, but I do not think there are any plans to drop Rsync monitoring from EPP. Your use case however is just creating a lot of files to be inspected for sensitive data and Rsync having no timeout will cause this issue.
Simply put, Rsync does not wait for us to inspect the huge amount of files and fails.
As for the other questions, I do not have an answer yet for what is to come in regards to the changes coming to Rsync, but that is something I will inquire about and provide you with an answer. Just bear in mind that being a question, this will take some time. 
Please let me know if you have follow-up questions at this time.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

I’m trying to understand the information below: does this mean that EPP is no longer able to monitor RSYNC and will not do this moving forward?

 

If this is the case, we need a confirmation so that this is passed up to Management as RSYNC is an exfiltration channel of interest for us.

 

Also, a few additional questions:

 

Wes the Cososys Dev team aware of the change done to RSYNC recently? (the information was sent to you by Denis)

Was there any measure taken in order to address the RSYNC change or is there anything planned?

 

I am asking these questions as we are now forced to exclude RSYNC from our monitored channels without any visibility as to if this is something that will be fixed by Cososys or not. It’s clear this is connected to the latest MacOS update.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I have analyzed the logs along with our engineering, and there are no errors in how it works and how we detect content. The reason you are receiving the error is simply that when you create a build, it generates a huge amount of files which are accessed by rsync. That translates to EPP checking those files. What we suggest is either remove rsync from the policy(ies) or have a special policy without it that you can assign users when they need to use rsync.
As for the link you sent, I will provide it to our dev teams and see how it can be adjusted in EPP. 
Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

Hello Emil,

Rsync has been used until now without any issues. Everything started with the new MacOS update. A similar problem happened in 2023 and was fixed by Cososys.
Also, the system is showing only a limited number of CAP alerts and this does not coincide with the 14000 scans you are mentioning. Also, the rsync uploads should not include any sensitive data, so any data would be false-positives.

Has the team looked into any possible change after the MacOS update? Are we the only ones experiencing this?

For the moment we created a separate policy that excludes Rsync, but this adds to the security risk and to the administrative burden of managing all the policies.

Thank you,

Hello,

One of the users noticed that there has been an update to rsync, connected to the latest Mac update. Here is the link to the article: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2025/04/06/rsync-replaced-with-openrsync-on-macos-sequoia/ It might be helpful with troubleshooting the problem.

Kind regards,
Denis

Hello Denis,

Thank you for reaching out!

Could you please check if the ""RSYNC"" is selected as exit point in the CAP policy assigned to the affected endpoints ?

Looking forward for your response.

In the 14000 scans not all of them were files which triggered the policy, in the logs we could see the number of files which were checked by the EPP Client.
I will double check this with the engineering team. As soon as I will have an update I will get back to you.

Hello Emil,

 

Rsync has been used until now without any issues. Everything started with the new MacOS update. A similar problem happened in 2023 and was fixed by Cososys.

Also, the system is showing only a limited number of CAP alerts and this does not coincide with the 14000 scans you are mentioning. Also, the rsync uploads should not include any sensitive data, so any data would be false-positives.

 

Has the team looked into any possible change after the MacOS update? Are we the only ones experiencing this?

 

For the moment we created a separate policy that excludes Rsync, but this adds to the security risk and to the administrative burden of managing all the policies.

 

Thank you,

Hello Andrei,

The issue is caused by rsync which is checked in the CAP policy. From the logs we could see more than 14000 scans and almost all of them are rsync related.
When the user is building apps with Xcode and in this process, rsync is used to copy files from one location to another (the files that are built/generated are the ones copied). If rsync is checked in the policy (and it is) the EPP client has to scan the files. If there is any confidential content in the files, the files will be blocked. So, the file copy will fail and eventually the build will fail as well.

As this is the expected behavior of the EPP Client in this situation where rsync is monitored by the EPP Client, our dev's recommendation would be to remove rsync from the policy assigned to developers.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Andrei,

I asked our engineering team and they said there are no plans to drop support for Rsync. In fact, since the process names are the same, everything should work the same.
As for the issue at hand, they are still investigating all the info and logs provided and will get back to you once there is an update.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

I do have one additional question: How is rsync still being monitored efficiently if EPP is unable to scan the information uploaded to it and blocks any build attempt? This is not an isolated case, it applies to all Mac users trying to work with rsync at this time.

 

All our MacOS users are deeming rsync unusable now as they are unable to perform builds using Xcode anymore because of EPP.

 

I am re-emphasizing that this is an issue that appeared after the latest MacOS update and it’s clear that this is not the expected behavior from EPP as there were no issues until the update. 

 

@oana.nemes@netwrix.com: can you please make sure that this issue is addressed. Please let me know if you need anything else from our side.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I did provide an update right before you sent the request. My apologies, I did not notice that you and the others were not in CC.
Here is the content of the update provided:

Rsync is still being monitored, and I will confirm this, but I do not think there are any plans to drop Rsync monitoring from EPP. Your use case however is just creating a lot of files to be inspected for sensitive data and Rsync having no timeout will cause this issue.
Simply put, Rsync does not wait for us to inspect the huge amount of files and fails.
As for the other questions, I do not have an answer yet for what is to come in regards to the changes coming to Rsync, but that is something I will inquire about and provide you with an answer. Just bear in mind that being a question, this will take some time. 
Please let me know if you have follow-up questions at this time.

Thank you,

Hello Eduard,

 

I’m trying to understand the information below: does this mean that EPP is no longer able to monitor RSYNC and will not do this moving forward?

 

If this is the case, we need a confirmation so that this is passed up to Management as RSYNC is an exfiltration channel of interest for us.

 

Also, a few additional questions:

 

Wes the Cososys Dev team aware of the change done to RSYNC recently? (the information was sent to you by Denis)

Was there any measure taken in order to address the RSYNC change or is there anything planned?

 

I am asking these questions as we are now forced to exclude RSYNC from our monitored channels without any visibility as to if this is something that will be fixed by Cososys or not. It’s clear this is connected to the latest MacOS update.

 

Thank you,

Hi Denis,

I have analyzed the logs along with our engineering, and there are no errors in how it works and how we detect content. The reason you are receiving the error is simply that when you create a build, it generates a huge amount of files which are accessed by rsync. That translates to EPP checking those files. What we suggest is either remove rsync from the policy(ies) or have a special policy without it that you can assign users when they need to use rsync.
As for the link you sent, I will provide it to our dev teams and see how it can be adjusted in EPP. 
Please let us know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
