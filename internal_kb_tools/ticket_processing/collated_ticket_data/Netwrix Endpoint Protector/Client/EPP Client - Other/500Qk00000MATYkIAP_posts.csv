Recently we noticed that EPP agent creates an Outbound Block QUIC rule in the local Windows FW on the endpoint. Apparently this has been a thing forever and went unnoticed.

Can you please confirm why EPP needs to create local Firewall rule? and If not necessary can we disable this process?

I am attaching the document with screenshot showinf that the EPP agent created local firewall on the host.

Thanks,
Parin","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-21T18:27:05.000Z"

As far as the documentation is concerned I only found a bug fix for Brave browser that indicates that there is one for Chrome and Edge.
I will seek confirmation from engineering.","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-03-03T17:31:51.000Z"
