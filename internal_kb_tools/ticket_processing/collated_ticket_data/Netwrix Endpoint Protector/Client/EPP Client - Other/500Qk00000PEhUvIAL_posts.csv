Uninstall Attempt - when the normal uninstall method was used (remove-epp.sh, uninstall script)</p><p> </p><p>2. Forced Uninstall Attempt - still looking into this one and will get back to you.</p><p> </p><p>3. Unplanned Client Termination - this is sent when the EPP service on the endpoint is killed using methods other than the normal one. (ex. a service stop)</p><p>4. DPI Bypassed Traffic - When a certain process/service is bypassed by the Bypass functions enabled in the DPI Configuration section. (ex. a website that uses websockets)</p><p>5. External Repository Upload Fail - when the file shadows failed to be uploaded to the configured file repository.</p>","","","","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2025-05-16T20:29:41.000Z"
