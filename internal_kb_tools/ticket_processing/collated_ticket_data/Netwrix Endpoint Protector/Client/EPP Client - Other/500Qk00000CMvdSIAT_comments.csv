@WaitingOnEngineerÂ 

Excellent info and explanations provided.
Unfortunately, there is not too much to do about this right now. We are aware of this limitation and maybe somewhere in the future we will try to do some improvements. This should only happen the first time one tries to upload from a specific folder. A second attempt should have a successful shadow in most of the cases. I tried to reproduce in my environment also, in my case, the background discovery thread starts faster. It might be related also to the specs of the machine.

We could have some general recommendations for POCs/Demos. Try not to use dlptest.com, maybe use dlptest.endpointprotector.com? Suggesting the latter one even though to be honest I had some hard time in testing on it. It doesn't seem to work properly all the time. Anyway, what I wanted to say is that for testing ideally we should use websites where the file does not get automatically uploaded when dragged in some form (this happens on dlptest.com, at least it did in my tests). If one needs to hit also the Submit button, that will give EPP some time to hash in the background the file and will eventually result in a full file path detection. And a shadow will be available.
