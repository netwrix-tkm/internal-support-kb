This has happened gradually over time and so was not noticed until fairly recently. I have noticed that the last seen for many of these are 2024-09-18, with times spread across that date, but usually in the morning, which suggests to me that on that day, they check in once and then for whatever reason are unable to check in again.

I have tried a fresh install of the client on my own computer, which seems to work fine, but when I tried this on a user who was claiming a USB device was being blocked (despite not having a block policy in place), I ran the zapper across that entire site (around 30 PCs), and none of them have checked back in despite me using our asset management software to confirm the client was reinstalled (via GPO).

I have also tried deleting old decommissioned computers, thinking that maybe licensing could be the culprit (although we do have auto release on), no difference. I also deleted the records for many of the computers that stopped checking in that day, to see if they would come back, again, this has not helped.

We are weary of updating to a newer client version, as we have not yet updated the documentation advising of the icon/name change etc. so if possible would like to avoid that as a troubleshooting measure at this time.

Kind Regards,
Pete","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-19T16:45:54.000Z"
