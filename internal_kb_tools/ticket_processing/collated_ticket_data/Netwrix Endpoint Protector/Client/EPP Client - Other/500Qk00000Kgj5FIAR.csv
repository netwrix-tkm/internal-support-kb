Attaching some samples in attachment, Kindly help.

Thanks","","Here is a brief summary of  what we did in our remote session.
We upgraded your Endpoint Protector Server from version 5.9.4.0 to version 5.9.4.1
We uninstalled the EPP Client version 6.2.2.1006, restart your machine and then installed the latest EPP client version 6.2.4.2000
We Enabled the ""Stealthy DPI Driver"" feature for your computer.
We enabled the ""Notifications Pop-up"" feature for your computer.
We enabled debug logs and collected a set of logs while reproducing the issue of ""Multiple Event Logs Entries"".
Under the Content Aware Protection policy we removed the monitored URL Categories as it was not needed for the use case described and tested within our remote session.
I have tested this scenario in our test environment and was able to only reproduce the issue of multiple event log entries under Content Aware Report, I could not reproduce the issue where Endpoint Protector blocked the web domain just by autocompleting the URL in the web browser's address bar without hitting the return key.","I will need to open an internal case with our R&D team so that further investigations are done by our developers and for us to receive their feedback on the behavior.  I would like to have a follow up remote session with customer where we can reproduce this issue and also collect extended DPI logs.","The refining of Content Aware Protection, disabling DPI Bypass logs, the use of contextual detection and regular expression was suggested to the customer as method to improve on false positive and multiple event log entries. The customer confirmed that this case can be closed.
Case closed.","","Andre Le Roux","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","49.3","Closed - Resolved","Renewbuy","Anil Kumar","2025-01-16T10:24:05.000Z","2025-03-06T16:29:58.000Z"
