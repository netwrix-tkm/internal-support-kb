Hello, 
The different behaviour is due to different server setups.
The cloud server has allowlisted XML files and the client is not scanning those. Please beware the even though the file sent is and office file (.docx) the actual structure of such a document is a .zip archive that contains .xml files inside it.

As you can see in the eppclient.log file from the cloud logs, xml files are allowlisted, and in the second screenshot during the text scan the file is ignored because of this setting. 




Having the same allowlists on the server will result in identical behaviour for the clients.
Please note that the allowlists are not set per policy, but from Denylists and Allowlists -> Allowlists -> Mime Type -> XML / DTD

This bug should have been avoided to be reported:

	 - 	server comparation
	 - 	open the logs files, the both of them and compare them
	 - 	scan a file and open the log file live and you will observe in one of the file the xml is allowed

Hi Eduard, @WaitingOnEngineer,

I hope you are well.

The acceptance criteria for the improvements in 5.9.5.0 is:
""The Brazil PIIs should be detected correctly. If the CAP policy has Brazil ID and driver's license checked and an ID is sent over an exit point it should be detected as ID not as driver's license and vice versa.

Test samples:
85619875150 - driver's license
856.198.751-50 - driver's license
57.376.355-6 - ID""


The item description:
""Based on partner feedback, please analyze input provided to customer, verify, and improve detection of Brazilian PII's.

tools on the internet to make the test and probability of a real document easier.

https://www.4devs.com.br/validador_cpf
In this online tool the developer can validate whether the CPF (Tax ID in Brazil) document is real.
It is composed of 11 numbers, but 12345678912 is not a valid number.



12345678912
12345678913
12345678914
12345678915
12345678916

I used this false sequence of 5 sets of numbers of 11 characters each, and the product still identifies this as Brazilian ID, which triggers a series of false positives in various actions when DPI is active in a deeper form.

Here in Brazil we also have the ""CNH"" or driver's rack, it is also composed of 11 numbers, but with a different verification logic from the ""CPF"" (Personal Tax ID). Your validation can also be identified online through the link below.
https://www.4devs.com.br/validador_cnh

Of the types of PII we have in Brazil, these 2 are the fundamental ones.
the CPF is used for ""personal financial identification"".
The CNH is used for ""driver identification"" but is used for personal identification (registration as a photo).

There are others that have greater complexities, but these two types are the most urgent.



Verify if at least we can ignore false positive digits chain like 12345678....""

Could you please confirm what test build you sent over to the client? Which agent version?
Thank you,
Cristi

There are 2 cases where the EPP Client is blocking files based on metadata even if metadata scanning is not enabled:
1. When the users attach a random file which does not contain brazil PIIs, but it gets detected and blocked as if it contained brazil PIIs (logs related to this: epp_logs_metadata_piis (1).zip)
2. When the users are sending a google meet invitation, the EPP Client is reporting some file uploads even if the customer is not attaching anything to the e-mail. This issue was not reproducing with the EPP Client v6.2.2.1006. (logs related to this: epplogs (6).zip and the video)

Further improvements were designed by DEV, already included in RC (Release Candidate) for 5941. It is also already successfully tested by our QA.

Customer can test it with our 5941 RC Client, is the one which most probably will be named production one, as we are close to finish all testing on this version and is stable.

Issue still seems to persists for specific, more complex file types:
What is blocked: csv and txt files.
What is not blocked: xml, doc, excel files

We have tested the same content(Brasil ID) of the file with txt and excel file and the excel file was not blocked.
Client we tested with: 6.2.4.0046

Attaching logs in folder Brasil ID in excel not blocked:  https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00412970

Please advise.

@WaitingOnEngineer Hi, I am not sure I understand the latest update. The original issue of the ticket was that there were false positives with PII.
The latest update says that csv and txt files are blocked (correctly? or on false positives?), but xml, doc and excel are not (correctly? or false positives?).

Please clarify what is expected in this case and if false positives are present or absent, thanks.
