"500Qk00000FWsnqIAD","00420462","Support Ticket","Outlook  PDF Printer","Hello, I have a user trying to print Outlook emails to PDF and EPP is blocking it.  It blocks it when using the MS print to PDF as well as our PDF software PDF Printer.  I have rebooted the client, added the specific local virtual printers to the computer settings allow list, the virtual printers are already allowed globally, the virtual printer is also a whitelisted application, and enabled the Ignore Virtual Printers computer setting.  None of these have resolved the issue.  I have also restarted the computers print spooler and the EPP services which seems to fix the issue temporarily, but eventually breaks again and prevents printing.

Also, I am running Server Version 5.9.4.0 but that was not available in the drop down above.","","The issue is fixed in 5.9.4.1","monitoring for a few days and then closing the case","fixed and stable","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","163.1","Closed - Resolved","SingleSource Property Solutions / V300 DC+CAP","Matt Abbondanza","2024-09-09T18:45:13.000Z","2025-02-19T20:00:12.000Z"
