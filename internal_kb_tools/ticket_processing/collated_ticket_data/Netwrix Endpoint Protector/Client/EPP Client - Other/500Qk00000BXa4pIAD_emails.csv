Can you please let me know what EPP server version you are using and what EPP client versions you have installed on those computers?
Initially the issue was reported on the 5.6.0.0 EPP server version with 2640 and 2842 EPP client versions. There was a fix implemented regarding this in the 5.9.1.0 EPP server and its corresponding client version.

Hi Support

Apologies for the delay. Please let me know if we can jump on a call and
try to resolve this as this is becoming a major issue for our MacOS users .
To confirm we are on EPP Server version :  5.9.3.0

We tested on both Client version 2.9.0.7 and tested again on 3.0.1.2 and
both times it also failed to be ready within Finder

Its odd because the EPP client shows the device but does not turn the
status to ""allow status"" even though it accepted the one time passcode. It
keeps the device in a grey status . The laptop itself cannot even detect
its on the device

Kind Regards,

To confirm we are on EPP Server version :  5.9.3.0 

 

We tested on both Client version 2.9.0.7 and tested again on 3.0.1.2 and both times it also failed to be ready within Finder 

 

Its odd because the EPP client shows the device but does not turn the status to ""allow status"" even though it accepted the one time passcode. It keeps the device in a grey status . The laptop itself cannot even detect its on the device

Hi Franklin,

Can you please let me know what EPP server version you are using and what EPP client versions you have installed on those computers?
Initially the issue was reported on the 5.6.0.0 EPP server version with 2640 and 2842 EPP client versions. There was a fix implemented regarding this in the 5.9.1.0 EPP server and its corresponding client version.

Hi

I have great news -- I figured out the issue and was able to resolve it to
a degree.

Our mdm tool, Mosyle, had a setting that was blocking external media from
being mounted. We have disabled it and it is now working fine. The one
pending issue is that it not installing with full disk access, although it
works without it I assume for best performance and results we need to
enable it

I just got confirmation that full disk access is needed being given but its
at a system level and not visible on the user side

One more additional question. How can we whitelist a specific storage
device for all computers?

Once you can point us to that resource we can now formally close this
ticket and mark it as resolved.

By a specific storage device, do you mean a network share or something similar?

I just got confirmation that full disk access is needed being given but its at a system level and not visible on the user side 
 

One more additional question. How can we whitelist a specific storage device for all computers? 
 

Once you can point us to that resource we can now formally close this ticket and mark it as resolved. 



Kind Regards,

Hi Franklin

Happy to hear that!
Can you check if it's possible to enable Full Disk Access from Mosyle when it's installing the client?

Hi 
 

I have great news -- I figured out the issue and was able to resolve it to a degree. 

 

Our mdm tool, Mosyle, had a setting that was blocking external media from being mounted. We have disabled it and it is now working fine. The one pending issue is that it not installing with full disk access, although it works without it I assume for best performance and results we need to enable it 

 



Kind Regards,

Hi Support 
 

Apologies for the delay. Please let me know if we can jump on a call and try to resolve this as this is becoming a major issue for our MacOS users . 

To confirm we are on EPP Server version :  5.9.3.0 

 

We tested on both Client version 2.9.0.7 and tested again on 3.0.1.2 and both times it also failed to be ready within Finder 

 

Its odd because the EPP client shows the device but does not turn the status to ""allow status"" even though it accepted the one time passcode. It keeps the device in a grey status . The laptop itself cannot even detect its on the device 



Kind Regards,

Initially the issue was reported on the 5.6.0.0 EPP server version with 2640 and 2842 EPP client versions. There was a fix implemented regarding this in the 5.9.1.0 EPP server and its corresponding client version.
