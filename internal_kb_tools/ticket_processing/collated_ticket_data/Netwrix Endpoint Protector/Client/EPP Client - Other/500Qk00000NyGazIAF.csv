We seem to be missing the Content Aware Protection tab after we upgraded 2 machines to the latest version from 2.7.2.3 to 3.0.4.1006. We tried both methods (Jamf upgrade/Upgrade job via EPP dashboard) but we're still missing the tab. Is this intentional? 

We also tried reinstalling the client. The client seems to be connected to the server per the timestamp. Also tried restarting the devices multiple times.

Thank you!","","- Customer available at 12 PM CST today to join remote session
