Could you please provide information regarding the following error code?
SEC_ERROR_REUSED_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL

One of my users was presented with ""Secure Connection Failed"" and the above error code whilst opening <a href='https://Google.com' target='_blank'>Google.com</a> on Firefox. Other browsers worked fine. After we removed the EPP client, he was able to access the site.

Thanks
Tom","","","","Certificate had to be deleted from Firefox authorities tab, and then applied again.","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Adarma Security","one two","2024-07-09T12:43:24.000Z","2024-07-16T11:48:43.000Z"
