Today, during a remote session, we faced a case of disconnection of EPP macOS client. 

Situation: Server is hosted on prem in Singapore. Client was installed on a macOS machine in Indonesia. They have VPN to connect to the internal network. 
When we installed the client on macOS it was communicating perfectly, but browsers were reflecting ""invalid cert date or certificate expired"". When I check the expiration date, it was till 2029. After that I disabled the DPI. 
Then we restarted the PC, and noticed that the client was not communicating anymore with the server, the connection status was reflected as ""NO"" (after Ctrl+Alt+i). 
Note that, I was able to access the web console on the same machine and was able to ping the epp server IP. 
After Ctrl+Alt+i, I checked the IP and port, and they were correct. 

Please let me know 2-3 time slots as per Singapore time, which I can share with customer to check their availability. Please choose the slots for post 12 PM SGT, for next week. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","We have not received any alert from customer side.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","12.0","Closed - Resolved","Halodata International Pte Ltd","Halodata Support Tech","2024-09-12T11:15:35.000Z","2024-09-24T10:04:00.000Z"
