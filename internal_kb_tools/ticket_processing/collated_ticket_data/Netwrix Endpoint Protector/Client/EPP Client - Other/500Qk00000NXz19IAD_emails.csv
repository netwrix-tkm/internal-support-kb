In the last 20 or so minutes of the remote session I kept trying to get in touch through the audio or the chat but nobody responded as we needed to perform some modifications but we could not without your consent first therefore the remote session ended.

As of right now, the MTP Scanning was enabled accordingly but I noticed inside your Advanced Scanning Exceptions that you have added the VSCode just as ''VSCode'' instead of ''VSCode.exe''.

Could you please attempt to  add the executable like below:


Then restart again the device and check?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Christeen,

In the last 20 or so minutes of the remote session I kept trying to get in touch through the audio or the chat but nobody responded as we needed to perform some modifications but we could not without your consent first therefore the remote session ended.

As of right now, the MTP Scanning was enabled accordingly but I noticed inside your Advanced Scanning Exceptions that you have added the VSCode just as ''VSCode'' instead of ''VSCode.exe''.

Could you please attempt to  add the executable like below:


Then restart again the device and check?

Looking forward to your response.
