@WaitingOnEngineer

I've checked the logs, the file is blocked because the EPP client is now aware of any network share whitelist. You should have another remote session and try again to set it. Or ask the customer to check again. If the setting is received correctly by the EPP client, one should find in the logs this: 

exclude.network.shares = 'some_network_share(s)_here' [ApplicationSettings::LogSettings ApplicationSettings.cpp:1527]

If it doesn't work, it might be related to some known issues we had in 5940 with allowlists, that were not always sent by the EPP server.

We had a new meeting with the customer and the issue persist even though we applied the allowlist again.

We have created another allowlist to add more network share paths.

@WaitingOnEngineer

When you do a remote session, please collect the logs as well (even if you decide to wait for a new patch and test again). If this time you really received the settings that were added in the server, I kind of doubt that with the same settings it will work in 5941. It is either a configuration issue (settings not added properly) or an agent issue. If you have the logs from the last session, please attach them. 



Assigning this back, since there is no point in having it on me as long as we are waiting to test this again with patch 5941 and there is no new logs added. If you have the logs, I can take a look.

Unfortunately you collected the logs but the scenario was not reproduced while doing this. So I can't see what was scanned and why it did not work. You need to enable the logs, reproduce the scenario and collect the logs after this.

@WaitingOnEngineer

We started this thread with some logs where I could see there were no excluded network shares added. At least the EPP client did not receive any. But indeed, there was a lot of scanning of files from network share. So I suggested fixing the network share whitelist part.

I checked the current logs. This time the above part is fixed, the EPP client receives the list of excluded network shares. Going forward, there is a lot of scanning here, but all the files scanned are from ""C:tempGBSDownload""and not from network share like in the previous set of logs. So, no NS transfers here, I don't know why.
Moreover, I decrypted the database with the policies and it seems that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy. Well, in that case, network share whitelist will not apply anyway. As long as the file is transferred through a monitored application, network share whitelist is ignored. If not, one could use network share as a ""proxy"" to exfiltrate any data outside the company. I will explain how would this work if whitelist would apply for monitored apps as well. For example, the user has a confidential file on the local machine. Theoretically transferring it through a browser is blocked by EPP. But if the user copies the file on the network share (which is whitelisted) he can then upload the file, through the browser from that location (again, because the location it is whitelisted). So this is the reason why NS whitelist doesn't apply for transfers made by monitored apps. The reason why NS whitelist was added was to give the user the possibility to browse the network share, view/open files, copy them to the local machine, but that's all, he should not be able to actually transfer them outside the company if they contain confidential info

Finally, in the logs I see a file being scanned and blocked by the EPP client. The reason the file is blocked is the fact that WinSCP is monitored in the CAP policy and the file is being handled (read) by WinSCP. 


If the customer tries the correct scenario and there are still issues, collect a new set of logs and I will take a look. Thanks!
