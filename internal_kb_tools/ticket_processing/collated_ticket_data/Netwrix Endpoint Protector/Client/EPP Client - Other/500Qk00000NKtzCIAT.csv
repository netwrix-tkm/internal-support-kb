I am currently using EndpointProtector and have installed the EndpointProtector Client on Ubuntu 24.04 running through WSL in a Windows environment.

I need to retrieve the policy from the server, but instead of relying on automatic policy updates, I am looking for a command that allows me to manually update the policy via CLI.

Could you confirm if such a command exists? If so, please provide the exact command for this process.

Thank you.","","ASked if there is a CLI command to update policiese.","Asked customer to try restarting the service.","Info provided.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","NONE","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","VicCnS Co.,Ltd.","kwangjae shin","2025-03-26T02:27:42.000Z","2025-03-27T06:24:26.000Z"
