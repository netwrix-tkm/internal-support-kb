We have recently become aware of (CVE-2024-36072) and while we were able to install the patch/hotfix for the server, I am not certain how do we install the hotfix for the endpoints. 

Can you please advise if there is a way to patch the endpoints from the EPP server or if it all be done from an MDM? 

Thank you.","","","","Conformed we can close.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","105.1","Closed - Resolved","Vida Health","Amir Elssibony","2024-07-01T18:48:31.000Z","2024-10-14T20:31:31.000Z"
