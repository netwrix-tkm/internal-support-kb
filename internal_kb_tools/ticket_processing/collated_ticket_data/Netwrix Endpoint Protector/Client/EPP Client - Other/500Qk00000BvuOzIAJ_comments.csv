Did the customer try file tracing on a regular device? Is that one working? Also, we need the rest of the logs also (especially options.ini) so that we can check if file tracing is enabled or not (I saw the video, but I want a conformation that the setting actually reached the agent also). According to the logs, the EPP client detects the device and monitors the allowed partition, so events should be intercepted. In the meantime if possible please get a new set of logs, with options.ini and with the scenario tested on a non TD device.

@WaitingOnEngineer a tentative fix is available in the test build available on the file server here:

--- CODE ---
Public/groups/_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_09_02/EppMac_v3.0.4.0002
--- CODE ---

The issue was caused because the encrypted volume appeared later after connecting the USB thumb-drive and the EPP agent was not expecting this.

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan I will create a development task for this soon.

@WaitingOnEngineer according to the latest the EPP client doesn't seem to communicate with the EPP server at: devendpointprotector.deloitte.co.uk OR the customer is manipulating the logs that get sent us.

So, even if we would capture the file tracing event it would not show up on the server.

Moreover, I believe that, because of the above reason, file tracing is not even enabled on their computer (to confirm this directly I would need the options.ini file, indirectly I think that this is the case because we don't get notifications from the EndpointSecurity framework, which usually happens when neither file tracing not CAP are enabled).

I suggest that the customer ensures that devendpointprotector.deloitte.co.uk is reachable when they do their tests and that file tracing is enabled.

If they re-do the tests and it still doesn't work we would need the unmodified eppclient.log file and the options.ini file.

@WaitingOnEngineer actually the logs are from September 10, 2024, but the video was made on 12 September, 2024, so you can ignore may latest comment.

Still it looks like file tracing it not enabled, can we still get the options.ini file and maybe the logs from September 12?
