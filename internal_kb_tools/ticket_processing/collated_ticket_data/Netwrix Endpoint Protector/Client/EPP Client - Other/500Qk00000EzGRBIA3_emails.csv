Hello Vaneet,

We have a size limit for the File Shadowing, which is set to 512 KB, by default.
Please have a look in Device Control -> Global Settings -> and search for ""Max File Size for Shadowing (KB)"" -> you can modify this value to 5000 and then all the files with sizes between 0 and 5MB will be reported.

Also, please note that only one shadow will be generated per file.
So if a file was uploaded a week ago and it has a shadow, then if the same file will be uploaded today, no shadow will be generated, because there is already a shadow for this file on the EPP Server.
I would recommend to create new files for when you want to test the file shadowing.

Let me know if this helps

Best regards,
Emil
