I have a user who is on Ubuntu24 running the client -2.4.04_v2.4.3.1007 and noticed this pattern where its takes close to 5 - 10 mins to shutdown or reboot. Looking at the logs it points to EPP. Can you see whats the issue ?

Reg,
Bharani","","","","Customer found a workaround: manually edit this file and make the following changes ""TimeoutSec=30sec"" instead of ""TimeoutSec=5min"" it shuts the machine down in 30 seconds. sudo systemctl edit --full epp-client-daemon.service.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","48.9","Closed - Resolved","Arista Networks, Inc.","Bharani M","2024-09-26T19:08:56.000Z","2024-11-14T16:20:07.000Z"
