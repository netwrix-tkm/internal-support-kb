Yes, the pop-ups are related to DPI bypass and indeed, the events should be logged in the EPP server also. The event did not happen when the logs were collected, so I can't see it in the logs. But theoretically, as long as the notification was displayed, there should be also an ""event log"" associated to it and one should find it in the EPP server.
