@Andrei Pop , to confirm, the customer did try tamper mode on without falcon/versa agents installed?

@Andrei Pop I'm not sure I understand your latest comment: does the customer PC have only Versa agent installed? In the description both Falcon agent and Versa agent are mentioned to be installed. If both of them are, did the customer test EPP with having both uninstalled?

The issue with the Endpoint Protector service does not occur at regular intervals. it happens occasionally without a predictable pattern.
The problematic endpoints have been functioning without issues for the past 30 days, and tampering mode is working as expected, even with both the CrowdStrike and Versa agents installed.
This problem has only affected a few endpoints. All other endpoints in the environment, which also have the CrowdStrike and Versa agents installed, have not experienced any issues.
Given this, it appears that uninstalling the Versa and CrowdStrike agents may not be necessary for the investigation, as the problem does not consistently replicate across all endpoints with these agents installed.","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2024-07-25T04:38:35.000Z","2024-07-25T04:38:35.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer the dev team recommends installing the latest agent (5.9.4) and once this problematic behavior has been observed (if this is the case any longer), to gather the event viewer log and the eppclient_append.log and provide them to us to investigate further, thanks.
