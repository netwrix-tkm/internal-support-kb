"500Qk00000Kx7gNIAR","00433240","Support Ticket","Agent not connecting to SaaS environment after running IP Change Script","Customer is in the process of migrating from their on-prem solution to a new SaaS environment hosted by Netwrix. The database was backed up from the on-prem environment and was imported into the SaaS environment. Then, the customer on two test Mac machines tried to run the IP Change script through JAMF using the FQDN of the server as the IP to move the machine to the new environment. The machine shows up and is showing as Online and Licensed. However, the machine itself is showing that it is not connected to the server. Looking at the logs, it seems as though the machine is in a registration loop with the server ending in a cert read error before starting the cycle again.","","","","Closing ticket as the issue is resolved. It was resolved by running the command provided to regenerate the server cert stack.","","Zachary Roy","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","EPP Client - Other","","","22.9","Closed - Resolved","Chapman and Cutler LLP","Veronica Yessa","2025-01-22T21:39:15.000Z","2025-02-14T19:43:32.000Z"
