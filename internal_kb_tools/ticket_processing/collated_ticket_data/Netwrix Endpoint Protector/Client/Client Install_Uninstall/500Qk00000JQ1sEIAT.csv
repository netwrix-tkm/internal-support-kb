"500Qk00000JQ1sEIAT","00429683","Support Ticket","Question regarding the appliance/installation agent.","Good morning,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently using the trial version of the tool and have a question:

Does the Appliance allocated to my hypervisor need to remain turned on at all times?

I’ve noticed that every time I turn off my DLP Appliance and turn it back on, a new IP is generated. As a result, the agent installed with the previous IP loses communication with the console.

Could you guide me on how to handle this situation?

Thank you!","","Answered customer's question regarding Does the Appliance allocated to my hypervisor need to remain turned on at all times?","Awaiting customer response to see if customer has further questions","Customer had questions regarding using the trial version.
