Good Day!

I hope this email finds you well.
Customer wants to hide all the processes and services of EPP client on the user's PC. 
We are able to hide the icon in System Trey. We are able to hide the processes in Task Manager. BUT we are not able to hide the services in the Task Manager. 
Is there a way to hide ""Endpoint Protector"" service, reflecting in the ""Services"" section of ""Task Manager""? Please advise if there is any workaround. 

Thanks,
