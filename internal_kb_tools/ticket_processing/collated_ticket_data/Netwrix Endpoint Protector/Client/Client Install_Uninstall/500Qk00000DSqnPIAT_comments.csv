As far as I know we don't really offer support for Jamf installations. I mean, if issues are encountered we are not assisting customers in solving them. Please refer to this: https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_workitems/edit/350888  or use Salesforce number: 00418410, there is an answer from the Product team:

@WaitingOnEngineer 
Hi, DEV's are not responsible for JAMF configuration as it is third party. 
Any documentation for 3rd party we provide is just suggestion guide how to follow the procedure. 
Based on this procedure various customers achieved deployment properly.  


Latest procedure can be found https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm
however in case of issues, they should reach their JAMF support/partner for help.
