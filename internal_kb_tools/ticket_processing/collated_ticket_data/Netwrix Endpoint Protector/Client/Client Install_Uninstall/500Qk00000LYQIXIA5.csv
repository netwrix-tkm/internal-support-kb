"500Qk00000LYQIXIA5","00434865","Support Ticket","OS Image - Client Issue","Hi All,

We created an OS image that appeared as a clone to the Endpoint Protector Client. This is causing agents on those PCs to not properly report into the server console. For instance, we'll only see 1 of the PCs created with that image in the console at a given time. How are PCs fingerprinted? I am hoping there is a way we can update however they've been fingerprinted, ie. reinstall, updating the serial number of the C drive etc., so that all the PCs can report into the console properly. Thank you!","","February 25, 2025

Customer reported that there are no further issues and requested to leave case open until the end of the week 2/21/2025

Sending customer email asking if the issue has been fully resolved

•        What is the impact of the issue on your business? All clients are not reporting into the console. Failing to pickup policy updates, etc.
•        Who is affected by this issue? About 50 PCs that have been imaged.
•        What are the steps to reproduce? NA
•        Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried? We updated the serial number of the C drive on 1 PC and it seemed to help. Does EPP utilize the C drive Serial in any way?
