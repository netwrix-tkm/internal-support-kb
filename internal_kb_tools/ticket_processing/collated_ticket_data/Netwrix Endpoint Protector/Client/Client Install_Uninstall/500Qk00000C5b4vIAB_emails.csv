Hi Alin,

Previously I believe there was an admin script that could remove EPP without user intervention and even with tamper protection on that we used for clean uninstalls.

While using the same script now, we see that the script/steps run as intended but the EPP agent remains on the machine and shows in disconnected state but doesn’t get removed.

@Ashish<mailto:ashish.labade@zs.com> can demonstrate on a call as well which I think is the best way to move ahead.

Can you please share 2-3 timeslots after 3pm IST where we can meet and discuss?

Hello,

Please perform a fresh download of the epp agent installer package from server UI. Then drag and drop the remove-epp script inside a MacOS terminal and run it as admin (sudo rights).
You may also try to trigger an agent uninstall from server UI > Device Control > Computers > check computer and click Uninstall button.
Let us know the results.

Thank you,
Alin

HI Manpreet,

Can you give us some more details about this? What script are you using and what does ""not working"" mean more exactly? Do you get an error message (if so, please share it with us), or is it just not removing the EPP agent?

Please go to System Configuration - Client Software in the EPP UI, download from there the installation package for the EPP client and run the remove-epp script that you can find inside that installation package, in a terminal, as sudo and let as know how it works.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Alin,

 

Previously I believe there was an admin script that could remove EPP without user intervention and even with tamper protection on that we used for clean uninstalls.

 

While using the same script now, we see that the script/steps run as intended but the EPP agent remains on the machine and shows in disconnected state but doesn’t get removed.

 

@Ashish can demonstrate on a call as well which I think is the best way to move ahead.

 

Can you please share 2-3 timeslots after 3pm IST where we can meet and discuss?

HI Manpreet,

Can you give us some more details about this? What script are you using and what does ""not working"" mean more exactly? Do you get an error message (if so, please share it with us), or is it just not removing the EPP agent?

Please go to System Configuration - Client Software in the EPP UI, download from there the installation package for the EPP client and run the remove-epp script that you can find inside that installation package, in a terminal, as sudo and let as know how it works.

Thank you and best regards,

Hello Alin,

I have tested the uninstall script that you provided and the EPP is not able fully uninstall from mac and it is still showing on console after uninstallation.

In this case can we connect for live testing.

Hi Alin,

 

Previously I believe there was an admin script that could remove EPP without user intervention and even with tamper protection on that we used for clean uninstalls.

 

While using the same script now, we see that the script/steps run as intended but the EPP agent remains on the machine and shows in disconnected state but doesn’t get removed.

 

@Ashish can demonstrate on a call as well which I think is the best way to move ahead.

 

Can you please share 2-3 timeslots after 3pm IST where we can meet and discuss?

Hello Alin,

I have tested the uninstall script that you provided and the EPP is not able fully uninstall from mac and it is still showing on console after uninstallation.

In this case can we connect for live testing.

Hi Alin,

Previously I believe there was an admin script that could remove EPP without user intervention and even with tamper protection on that we used for clean uninstalls.

While using the same script now, we see that the script/steps run as intended but the EPP agent remains on the machine and shows in disconnected state but doesn't get removed.

@Ashish<mailto:ashish.labade@zs.com> can demonstrate on a call as well which I think is the best way to move ahead.

Can you please share 2-3 timeslots after 3pm IST where we can meet and discuss?

Hello,

Please perform a fresh download of the epp agent installer package from server UI. Then drag and drop the remove-epp script inside a MacOS terminal and run it as admin (sudo rights).
You may also try to trigger an agent uninstall from server UI > Device Control > Computers > check computer and click Uninstall button.
Let us know the results.

HI Manpreet,

Can you give us some more details about this? What script are you using and what does ""not working"" mean more exactly? Do you get an error message (if so, please share it with us), or is it just not removing the EPP agent?

Please go to System Configuration - Client Software in the EPP UI, download from there the installation package for the EPP client and run the remove-epp script that you can find inside that installation package, in a terminal, as sudo and let as know how it works.

Thank you and best regards,

Hi Ashish,

I have replied on a separate email thread where we provided a different version of the removal tool.
Please test that exact version of the tool and reboot the client machine afterwards.

Thank you,
Alin

Hello Alin,

I have tested the uninstall script that you provided and the EPP is not able fully uninstall from mac and it is still showing on console after uninstallation.

In this case can we connect for live testing.

Hi Abhishek,

I believe we have a different version of that removal script.
I'll have to check internally with our team and get back to you.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi Alin,

Previously I believe there was an admin script that could remove EPP without user intervention and even with tamper protection on that we used for clean uninstalls.

While using the same script now, we see that the script/steps run as intended but the EPP agent remains on the machine and shows in disconnected state but doesn't get removed.

@Ashish<mailto:ashish.labade@zs.com> can demonstrate on a call as well which I think is the best way to move ahead.

Can you please share 2-3 timeslots after 3pm IST where we can meet and discuss?

Hello,

Please perform a fresh download of the epp agent installer package from server UI. Then drag and drop the remove-epp script inside a MacOS terminal and run it as admin (sudo rights).
You may also try to trigger an agent uninstall from server UI > Device Control > Computers > check computer and click Uninstall button.
Let us know the results.

Thank you,
Alin

HI Manpreet,

Can you give us some more details about this? What script are you using and what does ""not working"" mean more exactly? Do you get an error message (if so, please share it with us), or is it just not removing the EPP agent?

Please go to System Configuration - Client Software in the EPP UI, download from there the installation package for the EPP client and run the remove-epp script that you can find inside that installation package, in a terminal, as sudo and let as know how it works.

Thank you and best regards,
