One of our customers purchased the Netwrix Endpoint Protector product.

We are going to install. There are 400 clients. How can we send the agents to the machines as slient? Can you send me a slient agent setup file? To send it with a method such as SSCM or Group Policy.

Thank you for helping us","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-14T07:01:29.000Z"
