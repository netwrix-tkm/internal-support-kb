I don't have access to an AD controller to verify the deployment steps in the documentation, but I agree the documentation is lacking.

Somebody from the documentation team should change the documentation to mention that the MSI package should be downloaded from the EPP server and should contain in its name the EPP server address (and maybe other parameters). Otherwise the installation will fail. It would be nice if this would show up in the screenshots also.
For example, a MSI name  downloaded from an EPP server could look like this:

EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[a=demo.endpointprotector.com,n=0].msi

Hi @Robert Zavalczki,
Thank you for the info.

@Krzysztof Staszalek do you think the tech writing team could help with the update Robert recommends?

@WaitingOnEngineer please enable logging in the GPO installation command line and check the log files for why the deployment failed.

To enable logging, for example  one can add the ""/log C:eppdeploy.log"" switch to the Windows Installer (msiexec) invocation command. I have no idea how an installation GPO looks like, not do I have administrative access to a domain controller to check.

@WaitingOnEngineer

GPO/Intune/JAMF are 3rd part doc, and are out of regular maintenance & DEV support. 
It is not our responsibility to maintain their AD GPO and troubleshoot their configuration (as it seems for config issue). 

There is a lot of guides available in google how to configure command line syntax from GPO deployment for ex.: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62314923/creating-a-gpo-to-deploy-an-msi-using-a-batch-file


On top of that base Support team investigation is missing, did you check if customer used proper MSI with hardcoded server details or using dummy MSI file?
