We have recently updated our EPP server to version 5.9.1.0 and are now looking to install the EPP client on an Ubuntu machine. Could you please provide the appropriate setup files or installation instructions for deploying the EPP client on Ubuntu?

Your prompt assistance in sharing the necessary resources or documentation would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks & Regards,
Rohit","","","","Request solved, ticket will be closed as the customer did not reply back","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","63.4","Closed - Resolved","PeopleStrong","Rohit Nawani","2024-09-11T04:10:39.000Z","2024-11-13T13:56:38.000Z"
