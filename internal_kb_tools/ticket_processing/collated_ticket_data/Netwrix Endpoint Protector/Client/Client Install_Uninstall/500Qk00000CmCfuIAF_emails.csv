Hi James,

I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite, you can also join via the following link:
https://endpointprotector.zoom.us/j/85696118414

Please have Zoom installed in case I will have to request control of your screen and I believe you have admin privileges to your Mac.

That would be perfect! 
 

Will you send the calendar invite? And anything I need to do to prep for the screen share?
