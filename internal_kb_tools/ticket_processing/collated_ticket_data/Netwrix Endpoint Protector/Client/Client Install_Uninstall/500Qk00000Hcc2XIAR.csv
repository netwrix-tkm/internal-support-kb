"500Qk00000Hcc2XIAR","00425415","Support Ticket","Endpoint Protector upgrading client, no connection to server or discovered devices","Hi, we are upgrading to 6.2.3.1 of EPP. Previously we have deployed using SCCM which pushes out our MSI version (current is EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[<a href='https://a=j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>a=j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>,o=0,n=0].msi) which has always worked and contained our server address. Now after upgrading, Endpoint installs fine but has no server connection and discovers no devices. We are installing on Windows 11 24h2 devices. The previous version of the client still works so no comms issues. 

Please can you advise. 
Thanks","","","","The customer confirmed that this is now solved and we can close the ticket.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","-","40.7","Closed - Resolved","Edwin Coe LLP","James Millar","2024-10-29T16:29:59.000Z","2024-12-09T09:29:55.000Z"
