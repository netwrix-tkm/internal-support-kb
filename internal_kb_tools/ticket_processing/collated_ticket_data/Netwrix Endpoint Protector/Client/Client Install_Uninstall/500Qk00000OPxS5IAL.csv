"500Qk00000OPxS5IAL","00443117","Support Ticket","Can't uninstall client","We removed enforcement of all policies from our server and then later got rid of it when our contract expired iin November.  We have a client that must have gotten stuck enforcing the policies somehow.  We can't uninstall it anymore without the server to be able to set an uninstall password.  No one remembers the old one.  I don't think the client can update the policies anymore without the server.  How do we proceed?  I understand that you don't really have to help us since our contract expired, but I would appreciate any assistance you could give us.","","The customer accepted the disclaimer for the zap tool, and we provided it.","","The customer accepted the disclaimer for the zap tool, and we provided it.","Other","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","West Texas A&M University","Matthew Lauterbach","2025-04-24T17:18:25.000Z","2025-04-24T19:58:43.000Z"
