"500Qk00000ITK2cIAH","00427422","Support Ticket","Assistance Required to Uninstall EPP Sensor on Endpoint","I am reaching out regarding an issue with one of our endpoints, where the EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform) is installed. Upon investigation, I found that the IP address associated with the EPP sensor points to our old server, with which we no longer have communication. This is causing the EPP to restrict uploads on the endpoint.

I attempted to remove the sensor from the laptop, but I encountered an issue where the system prompts that the password for the EPP is incorrect. Could you please assist me in resolving this? Specifically, I need help in either recovering the password or providing an alternative way to uninstall the sensor from the endpoint ( Windows/Ubuntu/MAC).","","","","Client removed using Zapp.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","","0.7","Closed - Resolved","Jukshio","Naveen Kumar","2024-11-18T17:25:39.000Z","2024-11-19T09:26:21.000Z"
