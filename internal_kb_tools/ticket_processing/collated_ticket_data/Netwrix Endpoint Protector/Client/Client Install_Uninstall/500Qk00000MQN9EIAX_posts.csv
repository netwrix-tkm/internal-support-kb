Our enterprise license for CoSoSys expires on 4-Mar-2025. We are planning to uninstall CoSoSys Endpoint Protector agent on the workstations. There is a uninstallation password configured in CoSoSys portal. 

We are using a tool shared by CoSoSys previously to uninstall the EPP agent without needing for a password. 

Will there be any change in the tool functionality if the license expires? 

Also, is there a way to unset the password for EPP agent uninstallation?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-28T17:48:24.000Z"
