"500Qk00000MO11WIAT","00437296","Support Ticket","Looking for a way to uninstall EPP via a script in Mosyle","I reached out to EndpointProtector support a while back and was able to get a script sent over that I could use in Mosyle to push out the install to all of my endpoints, and it worked great.  

Do you happen to have something similar for uninstalling EPP?  I found the remove-epp UNIX executable file in the install TAR package, but hoping to not have to drop the file on each machine and run it manually.  

Thanks for any advice you can give!","","3/6/2025
