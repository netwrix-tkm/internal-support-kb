"500Qk00000CnsWdIAJ","00414368","Support Ticket","Uninstall from Powershell Script","We are no longer under support for this product but unfortunately we weren't able to uninstall all clients before our contract ended. We have been trying to use the console to uninstall the clients but it isn't always successful.  Is there a way we can send uninstall commands through powershell to our clients?  We utilize InTune in our environment for this on other software so we were hoping we could do something similar so we didn't have to do the uninstall manually for each machine that still has this installed.

The versions of clients we still have installed are as follows:
5.8.4.1
6.0.1.60000
6.2.2.1006
5.6.31
5.8.25","","","","the customer did not use the uninstall script provided and created one themselves.
