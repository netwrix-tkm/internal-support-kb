Neoway wants a way to deploy the windows machines without needing the parameters to be written inside the [] on the installer. Their deployer doesnt support the use of this character and they need another way to ensure that the installation will point to the server credentials. What options do we have?

Best regards,","","","","Kindly run in Command Prompt a command adapted from the example below:
msiexec.exe /i ""msiInstallerPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress

You can rename the msi installer to a different name and configure the epp server IP/Domain and default port 443 as arguments in the command line, as specified in the above example. A similar approach can be used when using a deployment tool.","","Alin Decean","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","14.1","Closed - Resolved","FcBrasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2024-06-20T14:14:02.000Z","2024-07-04T15:36:20.000Z"
