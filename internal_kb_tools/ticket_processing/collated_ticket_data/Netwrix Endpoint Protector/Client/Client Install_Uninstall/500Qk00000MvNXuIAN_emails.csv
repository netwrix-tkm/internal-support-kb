Hi，

Thanks for your quick reply.

Yes , I did operate under the local administrator account. Win11 can't install/uninstall/repair DLP 5.9 , whether right click the 5.9 pkg to repair/uninstall, or uninstall in control panel. New version 6.3 can't be installed neither.
It seems the uninstall last time several months ago went failed. The install directory disappear now.  There’s no dlp icon on the laptop. But some security policy still force, And client connection not established on server side. Strange status.

[cid:image001.png@01DB9509.2BDEFD40]
[cid:image002.png@01DB9509.BEB85F80]

Is there any method to progress the installation ?

Best Regards,
Amy
