ich have a problem with the cliient software upgrade on a few systems.

One of my collegues has the 5.9.28 on his computer. I tried to update it with the console to 6.2.3.1 but it always makes a rollback to the old version. 

We tried it with the msi too and we tried to remove it to make a fresh install but that wasn't possible. We weren't able to remove it using the console, programs and features or the msi.

We could try it and remove the folder and delete regkeys etc but i wanted to ask first, if there is a saver and better way.

thanks.

kind regards
Stefan Nanninga","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-25T13:13:55.000Z"
