We were trying to update old client agents to the newest version but entcountered the problem that probably an old version of Endpoint Protector was not removed completely. We checked the documentation and the client, but could not find any clue why the installation always aborted with conflict. Could also be related to similiar software products, but there is hardly nothing installed on this client especially nothing similiar. Please assist me in this issue shortly.
