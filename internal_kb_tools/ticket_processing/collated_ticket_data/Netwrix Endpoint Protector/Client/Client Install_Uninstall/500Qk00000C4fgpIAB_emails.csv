Thank you for reaching out.
Kindly run in Command Prompt a command adapted from the example below:
msiexec.exe /i ""msiInstallerPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress

You can rename the msi installer to a different name and configure the epp server IP/Domain and default port 443 as arguments in the command line, as specified in the above example. A similar approach can be used when using a deployment tool.
Let us know the results.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin
