"500Qk00000CNE8EIAX","00413230","Support Ticket","Facing uninstallation issue","Endpoint protector has been corrupted not able to uninstall or upgrade.","","","","Hi Team,

Today we managed to solve the issue in a remote session. After we ran the non silent ZAP tool we installed the client via command line.
The customer is happy now that the issue is resolved, the case can now be de-escalated and closed.

@Robert Zavalczki: Thank you for your help on this. Your efforts and help made it possible for use to solve this case and close it.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","","113.0","Closed - Resolved","InfoStretch / Apexon / Qmetry","Rupesh Deshbhartar","2024-06-27T12:46:19.000Z","2024-10-18T12:21:19.000Z"
