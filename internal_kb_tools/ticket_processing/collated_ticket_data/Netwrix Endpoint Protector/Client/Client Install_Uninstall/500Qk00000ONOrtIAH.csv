"500Qk00000ONOrtIAH","00442968","Support Ticket","Netwrix DLP Endpoint Protector Licenses","Good morning Netwrix Support team. 

My name is Daniel with LAUSD IT Security. I had a question regarding the licensing for the Endpoint Protector. As of right now, I was informed by my team that my organization is limited to 100 Windows licenses and 100 Mac licenses for the endpoint protector client. How are those licenses enumerated, or how does a device get counted for a license? Please note that I am currently using Intune to roll out the client software to multiple Windows devices. Will installation not happen once there have been 100 devices with the endpoint protector enumerated or counted as one license? At what step of the installation process does the enumeration of the licenses (or does a single license count) occur when the endpoint protector is visible on my end, or once it has been installed on a Windows device? 

Thank you for your help. Please contact me at <a href='https://daniel.madrigal@lausd.net' target='_blank'>daniel.madrigal@lausd.net</a> for I do not have a direct line

Sincerely,

Daniel.","","Customer has licensing questions
