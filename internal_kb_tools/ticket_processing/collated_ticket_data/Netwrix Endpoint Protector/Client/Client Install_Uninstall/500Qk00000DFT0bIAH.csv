At Step 4, there was an error message after a couple of minutes. Nevertheless, I see the EPP client packages. However, I am unable to download the client package despite clicking on the Download button. 

Can you advise how I can download the package?","","","","Upgrading the EPP server and using another application to upgrade the EPP clients resolved the issue.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","40.0","Closed - Resolved","Nixon Peabody LLP","Paul Goyette","2024-07-18T15:20:41.000Z","2024-08-27T14:23:49.000Z"
