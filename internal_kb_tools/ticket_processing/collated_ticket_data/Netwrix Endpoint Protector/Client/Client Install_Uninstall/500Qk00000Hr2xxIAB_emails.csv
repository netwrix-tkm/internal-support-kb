Here is the link for Fedora 40:

https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_fedora_40_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz

It seems that we do not have a build for Fedora 41 yet. I will have to check with engineering to see if that is because a customer has not requested one yet or something else. I will update you on that when I hear back from engineering.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

For the build, are the clients receiving the build going to have an internet connection or are they on an airgapped network?

Thank you,

Hi Zachary,

The client would have internet connection and would be able to connect to
the server.

Would that be an issue with this installer ?

Thanks

Ade

No, that will not be an issue, it just lets me know what type of agent installer to ask for. I have entered the request to engineering.

Thank you,
