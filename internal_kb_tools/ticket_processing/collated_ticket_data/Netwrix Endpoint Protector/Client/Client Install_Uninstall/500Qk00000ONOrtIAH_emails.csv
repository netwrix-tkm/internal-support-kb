Good morning Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for your assistance with my case. Unfortunately, I do not have the option to go into ""System Licensing""


[cid:image001.png@01DBB447.5B79FAC0]

I just want to make sure that I do not exceed any licenses and do not incur any charges for exceeding the allowed licenses. Would I be able to get that information from you if I do not have that info available? Also, since the system works as a ""first-in-first served basis"" Would that mean that any additional devices installed past 100 devices will not be installed or will there be charges for additional devices?

Thank you again for your help.

Good morning Netwrix Support Team,

Thank you for your assistance with my case. Unfortunately, I do not have the option to go into ""System Licensing""


[cid:image004.png@01DBB450.01724150]

I just want to make sure that I do not exceed any licenses and do not incur any charges for exceeding the allowed licenses. Would I be able to get that information from you if I do not have that info available? Also, since the system works as a ""first-in-first served basis"" Would that mean that any additional devices installed past 100 devices will not be installed or will there be charges for additional devices?

Thank you again for your help.

Sincerely,

CAUTION: EXTERNAL EMAIL

Hello Daniel,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. To know the licensing status for the Endpoint Protector, please go to System Configuration -> System Licensing. Licensed Endpoints are the Windows and Mac computers that have the EPP agent installed on them. The endpoint licenses are assigned on a first-in-first served basis.

[cid:image005.png@01DBB450.01724150]

The first 100 computers to connect to the EPP appliance using the EPP agent will be able to communicate with the EPP client. While any device over  the first 100 will not be able to connect to the EPP Appliance. You can install the EPP client to more machines after 100, yet the policies will not be sent therefore no restrictions will be enforced on these computers. To manage licenses, you can select View Licenses on the same page and select which device you may want to release the license from, by selecting the License and which computer it is assigned to and selecting the release license button under actions. Please see below.

[cid:image006.png@01DBB450.01724150]

Or you can use the Automatic Release Licenses functionality, where the licenses will be released automatically for endpoints that have not been seen online in a specific number of days (15 days, 30 days, 90 days, or a custom value).


Please let me know if this answers your questions or if you have further questions.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
