"500Qk00000En17nIAB","00418844","Support Ticket","Unsuccessful removal of EndpointProtectorClient","Dear Support Team,
In July I reached out to you and requested for a script based removal tool that could have been used together with our MDM to properly remove Endpoint Protector client from non licensed macOS endpoints.
Ticket number: !00D70091pB.!500Qk0COaMn
Download link for removal tool: <a href='http://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/remove-epp_mac_nopwd.command.zip' target='_blank'>http://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/remove-epp_mac_nopwd.command.zip</a>

I have taken this script and added to Kandji, rolled it out to about 230 devices successfully. However it turns out that the client has never been removed from the targeted devices, remained installed.

This is what the log file shows:

• Executing Remove CoSoSys Endpoint Protector...
