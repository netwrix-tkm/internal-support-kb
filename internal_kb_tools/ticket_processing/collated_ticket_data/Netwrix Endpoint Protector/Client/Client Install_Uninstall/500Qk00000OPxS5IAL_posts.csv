We have a client that must have gotten stuck enforcing the policies somehow.  We can't uninstall it anymore without the server to be able to set an uninstall password.  No one remembers the old one.  I don't think the client can update the policies anymore without the server.  How do we proceed?  I understand that you don't really have to help us since our contract expired, but I would appreciate any assistance you could give us.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-24T17:18:27.000Z"
