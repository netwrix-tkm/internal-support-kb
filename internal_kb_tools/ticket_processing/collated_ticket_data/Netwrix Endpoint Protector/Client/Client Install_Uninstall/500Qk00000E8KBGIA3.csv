"500Qk00000E8KBGIA3","00417457","Support Ticket","Client Install/Uninstall Issues","Some members of our IT team are having difficulties installing and uninstalling the client. Some of them performed a manual uninstall when it was giving them issues and hence their computers appeared as offline in the console. When trying to manually re-install using the client software downloaded from the console, they received the port error in the screenshot attached. The client did seem to partially install as it was in their programs and features, but when attempting to uninstall that it gave the MSI error in the other screenshot attached. In my case, I uninstalled from the console since I was showing as online, and was able to manually install the downloaded client without any issue.  Our server version is 5.9.4.0, but that is not available from your ticket question drop down yet so I selected another.","","in the remote session, me and the customer went differently and used another tool they have, ManageEngine, and were able to successfully install the agent on endpoints. they will push to other computers in the next few days and report back
this solution does not work on servers as they do not use a fixed password and when installed it returns an invalid password error","will check back next week for a remote session with Michail Frolov","We finally managed to use another tool to push out the agents to the computers. The servers however are still with a question mark.","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","117.9","Closed - Resolved","Hub International Limited","Ebenezer Brew","2024-08-07T17:45:08.000Z","2024-12-03T15:30:02.000Z"
