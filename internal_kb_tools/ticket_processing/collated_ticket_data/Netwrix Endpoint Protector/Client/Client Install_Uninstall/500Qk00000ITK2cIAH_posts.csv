Upon investigation, I found that the IP address associated with the EPP sensor points to our old server, with which we no longer have communication. This is causing the EPP to restrict uploads on the endpoint.

I attempted to remove the sensor from the laptop, but I encountered an issue where the system prompts that the password for the EPP is incorrect. Could you please assist me in resolving this? Specifically, I need help in either recovering the password or providing an alternative way to uninstall the sensor from the endpoint ( Windows/Ubuntu/MAC).","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-18T17:25:41.000Z"
