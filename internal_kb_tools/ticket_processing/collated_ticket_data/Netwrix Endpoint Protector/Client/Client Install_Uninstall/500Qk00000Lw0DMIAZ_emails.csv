Hello Alex,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00435989
Ticket Subject: How to Delete Old Computers
Ticket Details: Is there a easier way to delete old computers that have been offline for certain amount of time?

Thank you!

Of course, here are the questions I previously sent:
- What is the impact of the issue on your business?
- What are you trying to do or accomplish?
- Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried?
- Can you please let me know the Client, Server, OS version (if not already known) on which the issue is encountered?

- On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, GCP, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS) On-prem server (air-gapped)

Hey Alex,

Thank you. While there is no filter, you can definitely sort as descending by the Last Seen column in the table and select the ones you want to remove.
Then at the bottom of the page, just press Delete.
Even if you remove a computer by mistake, as soon as it communicates with the server, it will be added back.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions, or if this can be closed.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hi Alex,

Of course, here are the questions I previously sent:
- What is the impact of the issue on your business? Just trying to cleanup old computers

- What are you trying to do or accomplish?   Trying to delete stale clients that haven’t been online in the past 6 months.
- Have you attempted any troubleshooting steps yet? If so, what have you tried?  No way to filter clients by uptime. 
- Can you please let me know the Client, Server, OS version (if not already known) on which the issue is encountered?  Client is 6.2.3.1, Server is 5.9.4.1
- On what platform is your Endpoint Protector hosted? (on-prem, AWS, GCP, Azure, Hosted by EPP on AWS) On-prem server (air-gapped)
- If you have not, can you provide screen shots, logs, other artifacts, etc.

Hey Alex,

Thank you. While there is no filter, you can definitely sort as descending by the Last Seen column in the table and select the ones you want to remove.
Then at the bottom of the page, just press Delete.
Even if you remove a computer by mistake, as soon as it communicates with the server, it will be added back.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions, or if this can be closed.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
