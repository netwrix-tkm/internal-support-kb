Do you happen to have something similar for uninstalling EPP?  I found the remove-epp UNIX executable file in the install TAR package, but hoping to not have to drop the file on each machine and run it manually.  

Thanks for any advice you can give!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-27T18:40:58.000Z"
