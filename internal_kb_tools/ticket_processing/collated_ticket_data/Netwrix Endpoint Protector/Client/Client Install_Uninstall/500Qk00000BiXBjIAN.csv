We have a deadline looming for deploying 2.4.2 to RHEL 8 machines and we're having an issue where our Puppet team is telling us they are not able to set an environment variable at runtime. This is causing the EPP agent to not check in as the <a href='https://options.ini' target='_blank'>options.ini</a> is not being populated correctly and appears to be wiped out and replaced any time the daemon is restarted. A few questions:

1) Could you provide the the <a href='https://set_epp_client_server.sh' target='_blank'>set_epp_client_server.sh</a> script referenced in the documentation below?

2) Is it possible to install and point the client at a server without setting that environment variable?

Thank you,
