Our customer have SentinalOne EDR/XDR placed in there environment and the EPP client is being blocked by it, after installation. 

I would like to request for all the process names/Service names of EPP client (windows), which we can whitelist over SentinalOne. 

Please let me know if anything else is needed. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","- Raised a ticket to R&D to find out the process names/Service names of EPP client (windows) which need to be whitelisted in SentinelOne","- Wait to have the process names from the R&D team
