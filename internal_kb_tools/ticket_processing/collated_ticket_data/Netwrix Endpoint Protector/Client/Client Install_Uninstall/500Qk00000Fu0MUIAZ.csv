"500Qk00000Fu0MUIAZ","00421316","Support Ticket","Client instal pushing via Intune and not showing up in Computer list","Hi Team,
Looks like we have a super strange scenario.  I was able to uninstall with Intune and install with the correct MSI file.
 
We see the new install is happening through intune, and confirmed on the client computer.
 
However, I can I confirm they are pointing to the correct server (I still do not see the clients showing up in Computers on my EPP Server).  
 
Iâ€™m at a loss, and I really need to push the new client out to our devices.  Could we meet quickly to determine next steps please?
 
Dennis Robinson","","","","Intune installation only worked for fresh installs, or for computers on which the zap tool was used to uninstall the EPP client.
Since the zap tool cannot be deployed via Intune, it has to be done manually.","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","37.0","Closed - Resolved","American Rheinmetall Vehicles, LLC","Dennis Robinson","2024-09-17T21:07:31.000Z","2024-10-24T21:40:34.000Z"
