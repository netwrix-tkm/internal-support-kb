Hi Austin,

We have a tool that can be used to uninstall the clients.

Before we can send over the mentioned tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.
