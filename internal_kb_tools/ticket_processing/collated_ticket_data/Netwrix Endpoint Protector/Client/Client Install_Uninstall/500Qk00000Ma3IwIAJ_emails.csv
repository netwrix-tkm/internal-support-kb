Hi Deepti,

Thank you for your word of agreement to the conditions.

For Windows you can use the Zaptool in the attached Zip archive ""EppServicesZap64.zip"", you can execute this tool and it will remove the EPP client and all traces of it.  Please allow at least 1 full minute to run.
For macOS you can use the script in the attached Zip archive ""remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip"", you will need to run this script with sudo privileges. 

I hope this helps, if you have any trouble then please do let me know.

Hi Deepti,

For Windows we have a ZAPtool that will help you with the removal of the EPP clients and all traces of it and for macOS we have a script that can do the same if executed with sudo privileges.

However before we can send you the mentioned tool and scrip, we need your written confirmation that the tool and script will only be used by one of the system administrators, that the ZAPtool and script will be completely removed from the end user machines once it is not needed anymore and that the tool and script will not be shared with any third parties.

This tool and script is used only by Netwrix Support as a last resort and in emergency situations, it is not meant for distribution.

If you are okay with us sending you this tool to use within your environment, then can I ask to please gives us your written confirmation in this thread that you agree to the above conditions?

Hi, We are aware of this script, but we may need to also uninstall from devices that are NOT currently online, and may not be online till the server stays on live, i.e, may not get the updated uninstall password. What do we do with those? Both Windows and macOS.

Dear Akhil, Deepti

I hope you are well.

A new support ticket was opened by my colleague Oana Nemes on your behalf regarding the uninstallation of Endpoint Protector using a script.

We have the attached vbscript which you can run in command prompt with administrator privileges or PowerShell.  If you did set an uninstall password then you will need to edit the script to include the password, otherwise you can just run it in command prompt or PowerShell. 
In command prompt or PowerShell use cd use cd to navigate to the path where you have saved the uninstall vbscript then run this command: ""cscript epp_uninstall.vbs""

I have demonstrated how to do this via command prompt in the attached video ""uninstall remove EPP client using vbscript.mp4""

Please let me know if this worked for you.



Kind regards

Hi André,

We are in process of executing the script. We would really appreciate if we
could keep the ticket open for a few days till everything is completed?
This would make it easy for us to highlight any issues we encounter.

Deepti

Hi Deepti,

For Windows we have a ZAPtool that will help you with the removal of the EPP clients and all traces of it and for macOS we have a script that can do the same if executed with sudo privileges.

However before we can send you the mentioned tool and scrip, we need your written confirmation that the tool and script will only be used by one of the system administrators, that the ZAPtool and script will be completely removed from the end user machines once it is not needed anymore and that the tool and script will not be shared with any third parties.

This tool and script is used only by Netwrix Support as a last resort and in emergency situations, it is not meant for distribution.

If you are okay with us sending you this tool to use within your environment, then can I ask to please gives us your written confirmation in this thread that you agree to the above conditions?

Dear Akhil, Deepti

I hope you are well.

A new support ticket was opened by my colleague Oana Nemes on your behalf regarding the uninstallation of Endpoint Protector using a script.

We have the attached vbscript which you can run in command prompt with administrator privileges or PowerShell.  If you did set an uninstall password then you will need to edit the script to include the password, otherwise you can just run it in command prompt or PowerShell. 
In command prompt or PowerShell use cd use cd to navigate to the path where you have saved the uninstall vbscript then run this command: ""cscript epp_uninstall.vbs""

I have demonstrated how to do this via command prompt in the attached video ""uninstall remove EPP client using vbscript.mp4""

Please let me know if this worked for you.

Hi Deepti,

Thank you for your word of agreement to the conditions.

For Windows you can use the Zaptool in the attached Zip archive ""EppServicesZap64.zip"", you can execute this tool and it will remove the EPP client and all traces of it.  Please allow at least 1 full minute to run.
For macOS you can use the script in the attached Zip archive ""remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip"", you will need to run this script with sudo privileges.

I hope this helps, if you have any trouble then please do let me know.


Kind regards

Hi Deepti,

For Windows we have a ZAPtool that will help you with the removal of the EPP clients and all traces of it and for macOS we have a script that can do the same if executed with sudo privileges.

However before we can send you the mentioned tool and scrip, we need your written confirmation that the tool and script will only be used by one of the system administrators, that the ZAPtool and script will be completely removed from the end user machines once it is not needed anymore and that the tool and script will not be shared with any third parties.

This tool and script is used only by Netwrix Support as a last resort and in emergency situations, it is not meant for distribution.

If you are okay with us sending you this tool to use within your environment, then can I ask to please gives us your written confirmation in this thread that you agree to the above conditions?


Kind regards

Hi, We are aware of this script, but we may need to also uninstall from devices that are NOT currently online, and may not be online till the server stays on live, i.e, may not get the updated uninstall password. What do we do with those? Both Windows and macOS.[https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.ImageServer?oid=00D7000000091pB&esid=018Qk00000Jw8v7&from=int]

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your response. The script looks specific to windows. Do you have instructions for MacOs?

Dear Akhil, Deepti

I hope you are well.

A new support ticket was opened by my colleague Oana Nemes on your behalf regarding the uninstallation of Endpoint Protector using a script.

We have the attached vbscript which you can run in command prompt with administrator privileges or PowerShell.  If you did set an uninstall password then you will need to edit the script to include the password, otherwise you can just run it in command prompt or PowerShell.
In command prompt or PowerShell use cd use cd to navigate to the path where you have saved the uninstall vbscript then run this command: ""cscript epp_uninstall.vbs""

I have demonstrated how to do this via command prompt in the attached video ""uninstall remove EPP client using vbscript.mp4""

Please let me know if this worked for you.



Kind regards

Hi Oana. Thank you so much for your support through this. Yes we have been
able to remove the agent reasonably as of now. There are a few hundred left
but that’s because these people are on vacation. But that’s something we
can solve ourselves.

Wish you all the best!

Hi Deepti,

Thank you for your word of agreement to the conditions.

For Windows you can use the Zaptool in the attached Zip archive ""EppServicesZap64.zip"", you can execute this tool and it will remove the EPP client and all traces of it.  Please allow at least 1 full minute to run.
For macOS you can use the script in the attached Zip archive ""remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip"", you will need to run this script with sudo privileges.

I hope this helps, if you have any trouble then please do let me know.


Kind regards

Hi Deepti,

For Windows we have a ZAPtool that will help you with the removal of the EPP clients and all traces of it and for macOS we have a script that can do the same if executed with sudo privileges.

However before we can send you the mentioned tool and scrip, we need your written confirmation that the tool and script will only be used by one of the system administrators, that the ZAPtool and script will be completely removed from the end user machines once it is not needed anymore and that the tool and script will not be shared with any third parties.

This tool and script is used only by Netwrix Support as a last resort and in emergency situations, it is not meant for distribution.

If you are okay with us sending you this tool to use within your environment, then can I ask to please gives us your written confirmation in this thread that you agree to the above conditions?


Kind regards

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Ma3Iw:ref

Hi, We are aware of this script, but we may need to also uninstall from devices that are NOT currently online, and may not be online till the server stays on live, i.e, may not get the updated uninstall password. What do we do with those? Both Windows and macOS.[https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.ImageServer?oid=00D7000000091pB&esid=018Qk00000Jw8v7&from=int]

Hi Andre,

Thank you for your response. The script looks specific to windows. Do you have instructions for MacOs?

Regards,
Deepti

Dear Akhil, Deepti

I hope you are well.

A new support ticket was opened by my colleague Oana Nemes on your behalf regarding the uninstallation of Endpoint Protector using a script.

We have the attached vbscript which you can run in command prompt with administrator privileges or PowerShell.  If you did set an uninstall password then you will need to edit the script to include the password, otherwise you can just run it in command prompt or PowerShell.
In command prompt or PowerShell use cd use cd to navigate to the path where you have saved the uninstall vbscript then run this command: ""cscript epp_uninstall.vbs""

I have demonstrated how to do this via command prompt in the attached video ""uninstall remove EPP client using vbscript.mp4""

Please let me know if this worked for you.



Kind regards
