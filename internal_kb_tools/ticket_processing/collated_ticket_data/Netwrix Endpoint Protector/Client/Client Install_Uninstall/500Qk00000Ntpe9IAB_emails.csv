Hi Andrei,

Yes, we have reinstalled the client and restarted the computer twice today, and the notification issue still occurs on the computer.

The Device Control policy is working as expected, but the CAP is not running for the specific custom content keyword ""confidential.""

As shown in the attached video, we have created a custom content denylist containing the following words:
- confidential
- rahasia
- tata sarana mandiri
This denylist is attached to the CAP with the ""Printer exit point"" checked.
The results on the client are:
- Printing a document containing ""rahasia"" is blocked.
- Printing a document containing ""tata sarana mandiri"" is blocked.
- Printing a document containing ""confidential"" is not blocked.

Additional information:
Client Machine: macOS Monterey
Client Version: 3.0.4.1
EPP Server Version: 5.9.4.2
I have also attached the updated client log for your review.

Thank you for your help in resolving this persistent issue.

The same errors seem to be present in the logs.
Can you please confirm if this is happening on one or more computers?
Are there any other AV or Endpoint management apps installed on the computer?

Hi Andrei,

We have installed the agent you provided, and for now, the connection and CAP issues have been resolved. However, we have noticed that after installing the agent, the EE client already present on the USB encounters an error, as shown in the attachment.

We have tried reinstalling the EE client both automatically and manually but continue to encounter the same result. Could you please assist us with this issue?

Thank you for your help.
