We created an OS image that appeared as a clone to the Endpoint Protector Client. This is causing agents on those PCs to not properly report into the server console. For instance, we'll only see 1 of the PCs created with that image in the console at a given time. How are PCs fingerprinted? I am hoping there is a way we can update however they've been fingerprinted, ie. reinstall, updating the serial number of the C drive etc., so that all the PCs can report into the console properly. Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-06T15:11:22.000Z"
