Thanks for reaching out!
We have a tool for Windows and a script for MacOS machines that can uninstall the clients, please let me know which one you need.

Before we can send over the mentioned tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Botond,

Thank you very much for your response! 

My organization is InformedDNA and I am currently the IT Manager. I am the company administrator of our Endpoint Protector software, formerly through CoSoSys. I will only use the tool myself on my company's equipment.  Additionally, I will not share it with anyone else either in my organization or outside (no 3rd party access) and remove it from all machines once done.

I am in need of the tool for Windows client removal.  Do I need to put the uninstall password into the tool in order for it to work? Could you send along the documentation on how to use the tool?

Thank you again,
Julian","Netwrix Support Ticket #414308 - Uninstall Script on Windows Endpoint","jmolina-goni@informeddna.com","Julian Molina-Goni","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-07-08T16:10:18.000Z","true"

You just have to run it as administrator and it will uninstall the client, it will not ask for a password either.

Hi again Botond,

Thank you very much for the link!  I have a question about the uninstall tool.  Let's say I had USB and other Device blocking turned on so the client is preventing the usage of the device/drive.  When I use the uninstall tool will it automatically stop the blocking of the device, or will it leave it in a permanently blocked situation?

Thank you again,

If the blocking is done by EPP, after uninstalling, the USB drives will be allowed.
But if the blocking is done by other software, I can't say if they will be allowed after uninstalling the EPP agent.

Hi again Botond,

That makes perfect sense!  Thank you again for all of the support!  I was able to uninstall the software on a test computer without any issue.  I will make sure to use the tool only on my company's devices, and will remove it once the task is done, as promised above.

Thank you again for all of your assistance!!
