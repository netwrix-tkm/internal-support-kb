What you found in logs?

I can help with this because NOT relevant information was uploaded. Why?
- the eppclient logs contains 11 seconds information
- the eppssplsit logs is empty
- in logs the problem was not replicated

Please before you will try to collect again the logs (if is needed append logs, if you consider this will help), please analyze them.
