Good Morning Eduard,

Hope everything is going well with you. Since the license issue that has now been resolved, I am unable to install EPP on our servers. I can install it on laptops, just not servers and I am installing it the same way. Here is the error I get:

[cid:image016.jpg@01DB972D.5DC75A70]

Some of the servers that EPP was installed on unfortunately are no longer connecting to the console after the license issue, so I need to go back and fix those servers.

Look forward to hearing back and please let me know if you need anymore information.

Hello Ebenezer,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00417457. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00417457
Ticket Subject: Client Install/Uninstall Issues
Ticket Details: Some members of our IT team are having difficulties installing and uninstalling the client. Some of them performed a manual uninstall when it was giving them issues and hence their computers appeared as offline in the console. When trying to manually re-install using the client software downloaded from the console, they received the port error in the screenshot attached. The client did seem to partially install as it was in their programs and features, but when attempting to uninstall that it gave the MSI error in the other screenshot attached. In my case, I uninstalled from the console since I was showing as online, and was able to manually install the downloaded client without any issue. Our server version is 5.9.4.0, but that is not available from your ticket question drop down yet so I selected another.

Thank you!
