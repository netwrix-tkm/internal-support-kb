Thank you for contacting us.

If the client's server version is 5.9.4.0, use the below link to download the EPP for the Ubuntu 24.04:

https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.3.1007/EPPClient_ubuntu_24.04_v2.4.3.1007_x86_64.tar.gz

If the server version is 5.9.4.1, use this one:

https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1004/EPPClient_ubuntu_24.04_v2.4.4.1004_x86_64.tar.gz

Let me know if it works.

Unfortunately there is no version available for 5.6.0.We recommend to try and upgrade the server to the latest version which is 5.9.4.1 and try again.

Before any attempts, please take a snapshot of your endpoint protector appliance from the virtualization environment. That way, in case anything happens, you can revert to the original settings.

After you do the snapshot, please go to the EPP server and perform the live update:



If the EPP server is on an air gapped environment, please let me know so we can provide you the offline patches.

Hi,

The product is closed-network and we tried to upgrade offline several times before, but the upgrade did not happen. We could not solve the problem there, so we need version 5.6.0. Can we use the agent you sent for 5.9.4.1 on version 5.6.0?

Thanks for getting back to me.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that the 5.6.0 is 3 years old already, we do not have a confirmation from our tests for a backwards compatibility of such long period of time discrepancy between the server and the client.

As per this, we recommend our customers to use the latest server version associated with the latest client version.

The client improvements are also sometimes related to the server functionalities hence why we do not have a backwards compatibility for such a long period.

Looking forward to your response.
