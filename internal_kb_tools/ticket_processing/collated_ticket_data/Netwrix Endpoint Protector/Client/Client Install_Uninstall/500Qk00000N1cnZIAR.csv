"500Qk00000N1cnZIAR","00439025","Support Ticket","Issues installing client","Our IT team is unable to install EPP on our terminal servers and some laptops despite doing it the same way from an older ticket opened (00417457). 

Some of the terminal servers that EPP was installed on unfortunately are no longer connecting to the console either so we need to go back and fix those servers. 

Our server version is 5.9.4.1 and the systems are Windows Server 2019, windows 10 & 11.","","4/24/2025
