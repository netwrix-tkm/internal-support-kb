I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently using the trial version of the tool and have a question:

Does the Appliance allocated to my hypervisor need to remain turned on at all times?

Iâ€™ve noticed that every time I turn off my DLP Appliance and turn it back on, a new IP is generated. As a result, the agent installed with the previous IP loses communication with the console.

Could you guide me on how to handle this situation?

Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-12T14:32:05.000Z"
