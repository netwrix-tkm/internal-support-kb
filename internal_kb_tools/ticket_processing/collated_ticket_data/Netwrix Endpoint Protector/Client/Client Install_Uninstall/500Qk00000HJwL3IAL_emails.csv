Hello,

Thank you for your email.
If you don't desire to pursuit the recommendation, then you would need to contact us for each affected computer to remove the client punctually, as you as the customer haven't removed the client in the time as you still had licenses still active.

Dear Support, 

  

Thank you for your follow-up, actually, we looking for a solution which only requires action on a single PC, 

As it is an application we purchased a few years before, some of the PC installed but idle, 

We may not going to build a VM and try to resolve it every time we find out a installed PCs. 

Would you please let me know if it is the only solution?
