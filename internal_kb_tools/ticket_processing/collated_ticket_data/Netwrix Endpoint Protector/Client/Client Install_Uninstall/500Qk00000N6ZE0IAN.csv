"500Qk00000N6ZE0IAN","00439360","Support Ticket","Microsoft Intune Rollout","Good morning Netwrix team,

Thank you for your help. I am attempting to push out the endpoint protector client through Microsoft Intune. My Microsoft Administrator stated to me that the endpoint protector software was installed on 10 devices but they are not currently showing up within the ""computer"" section. Do you have any recommended instructions for troubleshooting for rolling out the installer through Microsoft Intune or instructions that you may provide for me? 

Also, regarding policy scans, are the speeds of the scans dependent on the devices installed and their speed or are the speeds of the scans dependent on the Netwrix servers?","","We provided the Intune MDM deployment guide link and answered the scanning speed question.","Waiting for the customer to confirm if our reply answered his questions or if anything else is needed from our side.","We provided the Intune MDM deployment guide link and answered the scanning speed question.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","2.1","Closed - Resolved","Los Angeles Unified School District","Daniel Madrigal","2025-03-19T16:28:03.000Z","2025-03-21T18:36:26.000Z"
