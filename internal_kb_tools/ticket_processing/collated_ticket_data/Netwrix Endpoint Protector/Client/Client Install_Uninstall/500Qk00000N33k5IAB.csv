Can I get the links for the latest version of the Linux client?

Mostly, they have Ubuntu 22.04, but the customer mentioned a few other distributions as well. I would appreciate it if you could share the links for all supported distributions.

Best Regards.","","","","Info provided.","","Andrei Pop","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Laykon Distributor","Faruk SarÄ±","2025-03-18T08:41:58.000Z","2025-03-18T09:01:08.000Z"
