I hope this message finds you well. We are currently experiencing two critical issues related to our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system that
require your immediate attention,

DLP License Issue: Despite having the DLP license installed and full permissions granted on the client side, it is not reflecting on the
server.

Client-Server Connectivity: Clients are unable to connect with the server, even though policies are being updated according to the log reports we reviewed. This connectivity issue is affecting our overall system performance and compliance monitoring.","","","","Reinstalling the epp client.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","","4.0","Closed - Resolved","Kannan International Pvt Ltd.
