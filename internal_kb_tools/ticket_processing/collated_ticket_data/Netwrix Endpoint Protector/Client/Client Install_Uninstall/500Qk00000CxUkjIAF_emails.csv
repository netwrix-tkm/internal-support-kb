We do have an agent for Amazon Linux 2, but it's a bit old:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPClient_v1.8.0.0/EPPClient_Amazon_2_1806_x86_64.tar.gz

I will ask if we have a newer one.

Thanks for waiting!
There is a newer Amazon Linux 2 client, which should work correctly with the latest server version:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPClient_v2.4.1.2001/EPPClient_amzn_2_v2.4.1.2001_x86_64.tar.gz
