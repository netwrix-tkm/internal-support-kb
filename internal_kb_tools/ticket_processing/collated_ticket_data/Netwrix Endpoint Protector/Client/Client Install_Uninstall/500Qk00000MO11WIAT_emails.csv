Hey Ramon,

 

Not a problem at all.  I’ll only use it internally, delete from each machine after and not share the tool with anyone else.  

 

Thanks,

Hello Mark,

I have discovered that we do have an uninstall tool for macOS. Please note that this is an internal tool, provided to customers just in extraordinary situations. Before we can send it over, please confirm that you will only use it as administrator and you will delete it from each machine after having used it and also that you will not share the tool with any third party.

Will you please confirm?

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey there,

 

I already had the uninstall Unix executable that came with the installer.  I was hoping for a script that would allow me to essentially run that file without having to manually drop it on to all of the laptops first.  Endpoint Protector support (before it switched to Netwrix) was able to provide me with a script to use in Moysle for the install that let me do something similar and avoid dropping the installer on the Mac’s manually.  I was hoping for something similar but for the uninstall.  

 

Thanks,

Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to follow up on my previous email regarding the uninstall script for Mac OS. Have you had a chance to download the installation package and locate the ""remove-epp"" script for use in the MDM tool?

Please let me know if everything worked as expected or if you need any further assistance.

Thank you for your attention.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hi Mark,

For Mac OS, the uninstall script can be found in the installation package of the agent.

Please go to System configuration - Client Software, download the installation package for Mac OS and inside, you will find a script called remove-epp. That is the uninstall script that you can use in the MDM tool.

Let me know if this works for you.


Best Regards,
Ramon Torres
