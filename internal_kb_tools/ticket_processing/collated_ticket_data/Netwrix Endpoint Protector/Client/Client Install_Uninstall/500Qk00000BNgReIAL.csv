Hope this email finds you well.
My apologies in delay response. Is there a way if we can modify command with the installation path instead of msi?

msiexec.exe /x <PATH to MSI file> ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""ADD_UNINSTALL_PASSWORD_HERE"" /qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress

Also, we are seeing an extension added in outlook. Please help us with removal from the outlook.

Hello Shivam,

Thank you for contacting our support department.

For uninstalling the epp agent please use the following syntax from the windows command line :
msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Note : You will have to input your uninstall password in above command only if such a password was previously configured from server UI, otherwise you can include an empty string for field ADMIN_PASSWORD_0.

Please let us know the outcome.

Have a nice day!

Best regards,
