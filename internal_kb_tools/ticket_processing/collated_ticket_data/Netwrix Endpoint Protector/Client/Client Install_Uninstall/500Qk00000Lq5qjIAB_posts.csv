Our customer have SentinalOne EDR/XDR placed in there environment and the EPP client is being blocked by it, after installation. 

I would like to request for all the process names/Service names of EPP client (windows), which we can whitelist over SentinalOne. 

Please let me know if anything else is needed. 

Thanks, 
Milan Singh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-13T10:05:20.000Z"

- Forward them to the customer
- Check if the EPP client stays installed after that","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-02-14T12:24:55.000Z"
