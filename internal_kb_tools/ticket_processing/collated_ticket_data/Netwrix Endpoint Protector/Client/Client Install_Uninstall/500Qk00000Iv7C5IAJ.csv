"500Qk00000Iv7C5IAJ","00428488","Support Ticket","Require Local Client Uninstaller","Good afternoon. We have migrated and licensed a new endpoint protector server as our old one was too legacy to license. We are now trying to remove the older EPP software on our client machines to replace with the newer versions. The uninstaller on the older version does not respond to requests from the admin server.
Requesting a local script or uninstaller to remove the software from client machines. This is for windows 10 machines. Thank you","","","","The command for uninstalling the epp-client was sent to the customer and they confirmed that this ticket could be closed.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","13.1","Closed - Resolved","Company 3 Toronto","Mark Carreira","2024-11-29T15:36:38.000Z","2024-12-12T17:04:50.000Z"
