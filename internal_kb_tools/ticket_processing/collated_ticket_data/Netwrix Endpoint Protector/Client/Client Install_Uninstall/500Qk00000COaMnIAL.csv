"500Qk00000COaMnIAL","00413328","Support Ticket","Removing EPP agent from macOS using MDM solution","Dear Support Team,
 
I would need your advice on EPP agent remova from our Macbooks using our MDM solution (Kandji).
I have already downloaded the remove-epp unix executable, packaged that into .pkg and managed to deploy tom y test device (/Applications/Utilities folder).
However while running the post-install script I get the below message:

• Downloading Remove CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Agent
• Installing Remove CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Agent
• Completed package installation in About 1 second.
• Executing postinstall script...
• Script exited with success.
• Script results:
• Uninstall process started
• Removing Endpoint Protector from your system ...
• Please enter your password for uninstall protection:The password is incorrect, aborting uninstall
I’m wondering how coud this be properly scipted so I don’t actually put any password to the script body. It would be uninstalled by Kandji itself in the background so obviously no user action required.
 
I would be glad if you could advise on how to remove the unlicensed agents as mass action.
 
Thanks!
