You can download the installer from the EPp server.
Included in the archive there is the remove-epp file.
This should be able to uninstall the epp client.

Hello Andrei,

Could you please add sujith@kredit.pe to the email chain.

Additionally, do we need to execute this over the terminal?? or this is an autorun file (directly run the file by double click)??
