Hi André

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?

Hi André

 

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

 

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

 

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

 

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?

Hi James,

Thank you for letting me know, does upgrading the clients from the EPP Server not work for you?

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?

Hi James,

Thank you for letting me know, does upgrading the clients from the EPP Server not work for you?

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?

Hi André

Thanks, appreciated.

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com<http://j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com>"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi André

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?

Hi James,

Thank you for letting me know, does upgrading the clients from the EPP Server not work for you?

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?

Hi André

 

Thanks, appreciated. 

 

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

 

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

 

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?


Kind regards

Hi André

Thanks, appreciated.

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com<http://j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com>"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hi André

Thanks, appreciated.

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com<http://j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com>"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hi André

 

Thanks, appreciated. 

 

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

 

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

 

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?

Hi André

Thanks, appreciated.

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com<http://j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com>"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

I have received the below feedback from our R&D team:

Both the Cameron and the Adam logs show that they are running the EPP clients from the 5.9.4 release (version: 6.2.3.1010) and are correctly communicating with the EPP server: ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"".

The fact that the EPP Notifier GUI interface is not showing any information and that the EPP server shows many ""integrity failure"" reports has to do with your certificate trust store configuration.
To fix this situation you will need to ensure that the GlobalSign Certificate Authority is trusted within your environment. Namely, you will need to ensure that the following certificates:

R3 GlobalSign Root Certificate
Valid until: 18 March 2029
Serial #: 04:00:00:00:00:01:21:58:53:08:a2
Thumbprint: d6:9b:56:11:48:f0:1c:77:c5:45:78:c1:09:26:df:5b:85:69:76:ad

and

GlobalSign Code Signing Root R45
Valid until: March 18 2045
Serial #: 76:53:fe:ac:75:46:48:93:f5:e5:d7:4a:48:3a:4e:f8
Thumbprint: 4e:fc:31:46:0c:61:9e:ca:e5:9c:1b:ce:2c:00:80:36:d9:4c:84:b8

Downloadable from this location:  https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates are trusted on your computers.

To verify this you can navigate to the local path:

""C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector"", right click on the ""EPPService.exe"" file and look at the digital signature. The certificate should be trusted like in the screenshot:






The screenshot also shows the Computer Certificate Manager's trusted certificate authorities list with the GlobalSign code signing root CA selected.  After you update the computer trust store settings you should then reboot the computers.

Please do let us know the outcome after actioning the above.


Kind regards

Hi André

 

Thanks, appreciated. 

 

The other machine we created the upgrade job for didn’t create an upgrade log – just checked again.

Hi James,

I reviewed the logs for the two affected endpoint machines and can see that they do have the correct server address ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"" and seem to obtain a valid certificate. I have escalated the case to our R&D team for further review and will get back to you the moment I receive feedback from them.

I wanted to also ask you, the endpoint machine which you created the upgrade job for via the EPP Server's UI. Did you manage to restart the machine again and check to see if there was an upgrade logs created under ""C:WindowsTempepp-upgrade.log"" ?


Kind regards

Hi James,

Thank you for the logs.  Just to confirm, these two logs for Adam and Cameron are from the EPP clients that were deployed using CCM?

Hi André

 

Sorry for the delay on this. I’ve attached logs from two affected devices. One other device that wasn’t working has now come online and has good comms. My other colleague who I am testing with is off sick so will send those logs once I have them.

 

Thanks

Hi James,

Thank you for your time on our call today.

As discussed on our call we will review the logs submitted in today's remote session for the issue of upgrade that fails for deployment via CCM and Upgrade job made from the EPP Server that fails.

Please also provide us with the append logs from some of the machines where the upgrade job initiated from the EPP Server failed as well as the append logs from the other endpoint machines where the upgrade were made through the CCM deployment tool.

Does CCM also provide you with logs after the deployment finished? if yes could you please have a look and let us know the results?





Kind regards

Hello James,

Can you kindly confirm, was the upgrade initiated through the EPP Server's UI or are you using SCCM for both the deployment and upgrade of Endpoint Protector clients?
