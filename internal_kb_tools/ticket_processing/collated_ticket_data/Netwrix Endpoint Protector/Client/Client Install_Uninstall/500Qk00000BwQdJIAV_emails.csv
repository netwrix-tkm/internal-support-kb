Hi Chris,

In my initial email on this case, I asked for more details. Please take a look over them and provide the answers so I can better understand what is happening and how to best start the troubleshooting process.

Are you trying to uninstall using an MDM, through the console, or manually from the Apps menu in Windows?
Are you using the uninstall command?

Here is the download link for the tool: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppZapTool_20230324.zip
Run the Zap tool 2 times with admin rights, and reboot the computer.

This is needed as the tool in the wrong hands can uninstall the agent without you knowing.
Please let me know the outcome after you run the tool on the computers.
