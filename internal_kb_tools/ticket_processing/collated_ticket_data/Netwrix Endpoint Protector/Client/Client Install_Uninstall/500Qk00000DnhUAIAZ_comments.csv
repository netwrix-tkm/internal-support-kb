Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

Usually, we offer first day support for new OS versions.

A new EPP client for Sequoia will be available once Sequoia is officially released.
The official release date has not been announced yet.

I hope this helps.

Please let me know if I can further assist.

Regards,
Cristi
