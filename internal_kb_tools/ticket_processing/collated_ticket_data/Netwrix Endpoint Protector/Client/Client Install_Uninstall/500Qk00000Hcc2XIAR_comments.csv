Both the Cameron and the Adam logs show that they are running the EPP clients from the 5.9.4 release (version: 6.2.3.1010) and are correctly communicating with the EPP server: ""j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com"".

The fact that the EPP Notifier GUI interface is not showing any information and that the EPP server shows many ""integrity failure"" reports has to do with their certificate trust store configuration.

To fix this situation they need to ensure that the GlobalSign Certificate Authority is trusted in their environment. Namely they need to ensure that the following certificates:

R3 GlobalSign Root Certificate

Valid until: 18 March 2029
Serial #: 04:00:00:00:00:01:21:58:53:08:a2
Thumbprint: d6:9b:56:11:48:f0:1c:77:c5:45:78:c1:09:26:df:5b:85:69:76:ad

GlobalSign Code Signing Root R45
Valid until: March 18 2045
Serial #: 76:53:fe:ac:75:46:48:93:f5:e5:d7:4a:48:3a:4e:f8
Thumbprint: 4e:fc:31:46:0c:61:9e:ca:e5:9c:1b:ce:2c:00:80:36:d9:4c:84:b8

downloadable from this location:
https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates

are trusted on their computers. To verify this they can navigate to the local path:

""C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protector"", right click on the ""EPPService.exe"" file and look at the digital signature. The certificate should be trusted like in the screenshot: Screenshot 2024-11-27 at 13.43.01.png

The screenshot also shows the Computer Certificate Manager's trusted certificate authorities list with the GlobalSign code signing root CA selected.

After they update the computer trust store settings they should reboot the PCs.
