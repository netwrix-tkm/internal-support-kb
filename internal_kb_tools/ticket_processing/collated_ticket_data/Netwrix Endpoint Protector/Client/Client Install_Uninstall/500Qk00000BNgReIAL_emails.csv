Hi Daniel,

I need to uninstall the EPP and outlook add-in using MDM (Workspace ONE). I am unable to uninstall with msi because msi not available on users machine.

Please help with the command which can uninstall EPP from the users machine without using path to msi.

Thank you for getting back to us.

We do not have any other command currently - as this would involve much more third party PowerShell language support rather then Endpoint Protector Support .
For Uninstalling the Client we can provide you 3 methods:

	remote - by pushing the uninstall from the server side
	the command that we previosly shared involving the MSI
	By providing you a zap tool that needs to be run locally - this however can be shared only in extraordinary situations by acknowledging and accepting a Disclaimer

Looking forward for your response.
