Hello Uthayakumar,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
Please find attached an extension key valid until 6th December 2024. To activate the license Allsec Technologies team needs to login to the Endpoint Protector web interface and go to system Configuration > System Licensing > Import Licenses > Choose File > browse for the license file delivered in .txt format > Upload.

Please confirm one this was completed.

Furthermore, together with my colleague Filip we reached out to Keerthana a couple of times to clarify some details, however we never heard back. Can you please confirm that your organization is receving our emails coming from @netwrix.com email domain? Please let us know if we should get in touch with another member of your team for the clarifications mentioned.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Oana
