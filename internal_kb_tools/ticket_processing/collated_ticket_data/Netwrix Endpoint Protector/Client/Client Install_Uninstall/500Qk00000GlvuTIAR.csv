"500Qk00000GlvuTIAR","00423241","Support Ticket","No transparent proxy installed after EP + Certificate installation","Dear partner,

after installing EP and the certificate on a macOS 15 MacBook, everything seems to be ok but there is no pop-up triggered to installed the transparent proxy. 

Even after two restarts.Therefore uploads tests of sensitive file is not detected by EP dashboard unfortunately. 

We also added the device inside the policy to try to trigger this transparent proxy to pop-up but it doesn't work. 

Is there anything that needs to be done differently on macOS 15 ? 

For information, it works fine for MacBooks on which EP was installed before upgrading to MacOS 15.Could you please help us on that ?

BR,Yacine","","","","Hi André,

Following our meeting from Wednesday I tried again to trigger the popup, but it failed.
However, after a full wipe and full re-installation of MacOS 15, it finally worked properly.
Probaly something went wrong on the migration from macOS 14 to macOS 15. Anyway it’s solved from now on.

Thank you for your support.

This ticket can therefore be marked as solved.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","NONE","","12.9","Closed - Resolved","HQLAx","Yacine BOUMEKIK","2024-10-08T09:53:58.000Z","2024-10-21T08:27:06.000Z"
