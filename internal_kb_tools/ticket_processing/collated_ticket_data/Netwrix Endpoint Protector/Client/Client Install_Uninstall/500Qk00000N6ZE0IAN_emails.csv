Thank you for reaching out.

Please find the Microsoft MDM Intune deployment guide here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/Intune/Overview.htm

Could you please clarify whether you are referring to the eDiscovery policies or the CAP policies when discussing scan speeds?

• CAP policies scan uploads/traffic in real time, reporting or blocking actions as defined in the policy.
• eDiscovery policies scan the entire computer or specific locations (depending on the policy configuration). The duration of the scan depends on factors such as storage size, the number of files, and the number of computers on which the policy is applied.

I hope this answers your question. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Good morning Denney,

Thank you for the guide,

I am referring to eDiscovery policies for the scan speeds I also had another question. When exporting the results of the scan results and actions. Despite having over 500 objects found, the report only allows me to export 200 results. Is the reporting and scanning section when exporting limited to only 200 results?

Thank you.

Another question I had is that Does the scans for eDiscovery only scan for rules in place for data at rest or in transit?

The maximum number of records returned in a report can be set from the Device Control -> Global Settings -> scroll to the bottom of the page to the Display Settings section and select another value from the dropdown:


Regarding the eDiscovery policy scan speed, as far as I know, the EPP Server does not affect the speed of the scans, so it remains the computer performance, but just to make sure I will confirm this with the engineering team.

Good morning Netwix Support Team,

Thank you for following up with my ticket.

You helped me with the initial issue and the documentation for the Intune rollout. I had some other questions regarding different settings within Netwrix DLP, and I wanted to ask if I should open a separate ticket or if I could email the associated email.

Thank you again for all your help.

Hello Daniel,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00439360. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00439360
Ticket Subject: Microsoft Intune Rollout
Ticket Details: Good morning Netwrix team,

Thank you for your help. I am attempting to push out the endpoint protector client through Microsoft Intune. My Microsoft Administrator stated to me that the endpoint protector software was installed on 10 devices but they are not currently showing up within the ""computer"" section. Do you have any recommended instructions for troubleshooting for rolling out the installer through Microsoft Intune or instructions that you may provide for me?

Also, regarding policy scans, are the speeds of the scans dependent on the devices installed and their speed or are the speeds of the scans dependent on the Netwrix servers?

Thank you!
