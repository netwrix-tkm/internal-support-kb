"500Qk00000LRSFUIA5","00434546","Support Ticket","The agent issue","Hello There,

We're trialing the endpoint protector and installed the agent in a macOS client (15.3). The agent and the server both are in the latest release (I do not see the latest version here, 5.9.4.1). We can see the client status ONLINE in the dashboard but shows ""Connected: NO"" in the endpoint agent. 
Your colleagues suggested us to create a ticket to get technical support.

Best,
Kerem","","The customer confirmed the Epp client is communicating with the server when they turn off the VPN.
The VPN is using TLS decription.
