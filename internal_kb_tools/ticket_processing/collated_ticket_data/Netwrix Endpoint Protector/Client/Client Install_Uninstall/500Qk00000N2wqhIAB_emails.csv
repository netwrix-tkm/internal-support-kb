Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support.

Information on client uninstall is also provided in the below article.

Client Software:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/SystemConfiguration/Overview.htm

You can download the attached vbscript and then run in cmd with administrator privileges or PowerShell.  In cmd or PowerShell use cd to navigate to the path where you have saved the uninstall vbscript then run this command:

""cscript epp_uninstall.vbs""

I have demonstrated how to do this via cmd in the attached video ""uninstall remove EPP client using vbscript.mp4""

Please let me know if this worked for you, if you have any follow up questions then please do let us know.


Kind regards

Thank you for the info. I tried it some endpoints and it removes the software from them, but the problem is, DLP console still shows them as online after 16 hours. Did I miss something here?

Thank you for the update and your valuable feedback.  I am not sure why that is, but it is something that we can investigate.  I know there is a delay but 16 hours seems a little too long.  I can test this scenario within our test environment and see if I am able to reproduce the issue of delay.

Thank you for your email.  My apologies for not getting back to you sooner.  This case is on my list to investigate further and I returned today after being out of office.
I have tried to reproduce the scenario but was not successful, after running the VBScript the status of the endpoint updated to ""Offline"" after about 5 minutes.  Can you please let me know if the last seen time under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" reflects the date and time that you ran the script to remove the EPP client from the endpoint or does it reflect a recent or current time?

Also how many endpoints are still showing ""Online"" after you have ran the EPP client removal script?

Hello Andre,

Thanks for the update. Unfortunately, now it's quite complicated to answer this question since we had a deadline to remove some agents, so we used that script in SCCM, and I also checked and selected ""Uninstall"" from within the DLP console. I'll reproduce this again on my endpoint and will let you know about the results.

Hello again,
A very fast update before I change anything. During that period, I also asked our colleague to remove the agent from my computer via SCCM as a test :D. Now, I don't have the agent, but my computer is still being shown in DLP console and last seen is 19.03.2025, Licensed, Offline!

Thank you for the update. 

The license was not automatically released for the endpoint which are no longer in use or it could be that the interval set for ""Automatic Release License"" has not been reached yet.  Can you try to release all the licenses and observe again the statuses for all the decommissioned endpoints and let me know please?
See attached video on how to release the license.

Under ""Device Control"" > ""Computers"" you can set a filter on ""Licensed"" and ""Offline"" as shown in the example below screenshot.  Here you will be able to see the endpoints that are offline with last seen dates that still have licenses reserved for them.  The release license action will free up licenses which are not in use.

Hi,

Before doing this action I have two questions. There are some computers with an eye icon beside their names. Is this related to the pending uninstall action? And if I release licenses for endpoints that have been offline for more than 15 days, do they get the license back if they come online again? I ask this for those computers that are offline but we don't want to uninstall them.

Please see below my responses to your questions.

Before doing this action I have two questions. There are some computers with an eye icon beside their names. Is this related to the pending uninstall action? Yes correct.
And if I release licenses for endpoints that have been offline for more than 15 days, do they get the license back if they come online again? Yes, the moment they come back online and communicate to the EPP Server they will receive a license.
