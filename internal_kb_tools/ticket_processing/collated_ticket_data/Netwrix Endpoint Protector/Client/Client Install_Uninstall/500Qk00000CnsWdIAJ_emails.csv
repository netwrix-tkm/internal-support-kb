Kindly find an archived .vbs file in the below link, for the silent uninstall of the EPP Client on Windows: http://download.endpointprotector.com/debug_agent/epp_uninstall.zip If you have an uninstall protection password, enter it in the uninstall_password line, according to the instructions, before running the .vbs. This tool is meant to be run via the command line or an MDM and would be best to reboot the machines that have received the uninstall command.

Please let me know the outcome

Thank you,
