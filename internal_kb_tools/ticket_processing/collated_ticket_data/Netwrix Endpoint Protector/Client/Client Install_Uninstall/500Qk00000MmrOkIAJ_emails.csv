What installer are you using?
By default, the Epp client requires internet access to install if the dependencies are missing.
You can try to install the dependencies shown in the list before installing the Epp client.
Or you can request a FAT client.

Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.

Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.

Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.

Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Hello,
 
Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.
 
Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Hello,
 
Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.
 
Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
 
Kind regards

Hello,
 
Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.
 
Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
 
Kind regards

Hi Andrei Pop,
We encountered difficulties in installing the DLP client on that machine. Even after gaining internet access, the installation was unsuccessful. Consequently, we advised the user to upgrade the operating system version.

Hi Andrei Pop,
We encountered difficulties in installing the DLP client on that machine. Even after gaining internet access, the installation was unsuccessful. Consequently, we advised the user to upgrade the operating system version.

Hello,
 
Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.
 
Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Hi Andrei,
Certainly, due to the operation of essential services within their system, the process of upgrading the operating system may require a few days. Therefore, we kindly request that you do not close this ticket for a period of three weeks.

Hi Andrei,
Certainly, due to the operation of essential services within their system, the process of upgrading the operating system may require a few days. Therefore, we kindly request that you do not close this ticket for a period of three weeks.

Hi Andrei Pop,
We encountered difficulties in installing the DLP client on that machine. Even after gaining internet access, the installation was unsuccessful. Consequently, we advised the user to upgrade the operating system version.

Hi Andrei,
we were busy in project activities and as I said this machine is running a web service which is being used on daily basis. Let me plan a backup machine to run the service in parellel and then we can go for upgrade.

Hi Andrei,
Certainly, due to the operation of essential services within their system, the process of upgrading the operating system may require a few days. Therefore, we kindly request that you do not close this ticket for a period of three weeks.

Hi Andrei Pop,
We encountered difficulties in installing the DLP client on that machine. Even after gaining internet access, the installation was unsuccessful. Consequently, we advised the user to upgrade the operating system version.

Hello,

Thank you for the update.
During install did it show any errors?
Can the Epp client icon be seen on the computer?
Please open the Epp client go to the settings tab and press ctrl + alt + i to see if an IP is set.

Can you please also collect a set of logs using the commands below on the terminal?
cd /var/log/epp-client/
touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

Kind regards
