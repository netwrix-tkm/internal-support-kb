"500Qk00000H639XIAR","00424054","Support Ticket","Uninstall of password protected Client over CLI","Hello,
we deploy the client with our software deployment system. It uses MsiExec Commands and works fine for silent installation. We use this command:
MsiExec /I ""%SRC%EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[a=172.20.1.37,n=0].msi""

However it seems not possible uninstalling the Client with MSIExec. When starting command MsiExec /X {ID of EP} we get message: ""The setup must update files or services that cannot be updated while the system is running. If oyu choose to continue, a reboot will be required to complete the setup""  The uninstall should be password protected by the server. 
How can we uninstall the client over Command LIne / MsiExec Command -including the password if needed?
