We are in the POC stage with our customer and found following issues in the EPP Client installed on MacOS 12.7 (Monterey). 
1. The client notification is not displaying when DC/CAP Policies violation occurs. 
2. The client connection status is displaying as not connected even though the policie updates received from the server. 

I have attached the client logs as well as snapshot of the client status. Please help for checking the issues. 
Thank you. 

Regards,","","2025.04.16: Logs show the notifier is not working.
DC is working, CAP partially working.
