We attempted to deploy the EPP agent using a central deployment tool, but something went wrong, and I am unable to see the server IP in the EPP client. I now need to uninstall the EPP client from these laptops. We tried to uninstall it from the laptop but getting error message that you connot uninstall it.

Could you please provide instructions to remove the EPP client?

Best Regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-21T12:23:31.000Z"
