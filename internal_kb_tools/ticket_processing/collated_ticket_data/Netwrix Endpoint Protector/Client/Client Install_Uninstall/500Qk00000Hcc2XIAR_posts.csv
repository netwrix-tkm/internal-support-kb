Previously we have deployed using SCCM which pushes out our MSI version (current is EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[<a href='https://a=j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com' target='_blank'>a=j3p4gni.hosted.endpointprotector.com</a>,o=0,n=0].msi) which has always worked and contained our server address. Now after upgrading, Endpoint installs fine but has no server connection and discovers no devices. We are installing on Windows 11 24h2 devices. The previous version of the client still works so no comms issues. 

Please can you advise. 
Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-29T16:29:59.000Z"
