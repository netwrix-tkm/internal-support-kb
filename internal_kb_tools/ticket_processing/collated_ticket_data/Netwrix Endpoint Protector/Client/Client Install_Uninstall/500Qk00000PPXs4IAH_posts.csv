we have configured a new EPP Server but the clients on the devices are still connected with the old server. I already tried to install the agent again but it doesnt seem to have overwritten the old configurations. Is there a possibility to uninstall the agent first without the old server dashboard? Or can I perhaps just delete the directory? What is the best way to introduce the new server? Thank you very much in advance!

Kind regards 

Ivy Nguy","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-21T07:39:14.000Z"

- Reinstalling the EPP agent does not automatically update the server connection settings on the client.
- The agent retains its configuration, including the server address, unless it is fully uninstalled or reconfigured.
- The customer does not have access to the old server dashboard to perform a remote uninstall or push new settings.
- Manually deleting the agent directory is not a recommended or complete method for uninstalling the EPP agent, as it may leave behind services, drivers, or registry entries.
- A clean uninstall and reinstall is required to ensure the client connects to the new server or for the customer to use the SET IP Server tool.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-21T07:50:39.000Z"

1. On each client device, perform a full uninstall of the Endpoint Protector agent using the official uninstaller:
   - On Windows: Use ""Add or Remove Programs"" or run the uninstaller from the EPP installation directory.
   - On macOS: Use the provided uninstaller package or script.
2. After uninstalling, reboot the client device to ensure all components are removed.
3. Install the EPP agent provided by the new server. Ensure you use the installation package generated from the new server, as it will contain the correct server address and configuration.
4. Verify that the client now connects to the new EPP server.
5. If you encounter issues with the uninstall process (e.g., missing uninstaller, password protection), contact Netwrix Support for a removal tool or further assistance.
6. Do not manually delete the agent directory, as this may leave behind residual files or registry entries that could interfere with future installations.
7. For large deployments, consider using a script or software deployment tool to automate the uninstall and reinstall process.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-21T07:51:19.000Z"

1. Use the ""SetServerIP"" tool provided by Netwrix to update the server address on each client, allowing them to connect to the new EPP server without uninstalling the agent.
   - Download link: https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/SetServerIP.7z
2. If a clean uninstall is preferred, use the official uninstaller:
   - On Windows: Go to ""Add or Remove Programs"" (or ""Programs and Features""), find Endpoint Protector, and select Uninstall, or run the uninstaller from the EPP installation directory.
   - On macOS: Use the official uninstaller package or script provided with your Endpoint Protector installation.
3. After uninstalling, reboot the client device to ensure all components are removed.
4. Install the EPP agent package generated by the new server, which will contain the correct server address and configuration.
5. Do not manually delete the agent directory, as this may leave behind residual files or registry entries.
6. For large deployments, consider using a script or software deployment tool to automate the SetServerIP process or the uninstall/reinstall workflow.
7. If you encounter issues with the uninstall process (e.g., missing uninstaller, password protection), contact Netwrix Support for a removal tool or further assistance.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-22T15:24:02.000Z"

- The customer does not have access to the old server dashboard, so remote uninstallation or configuration push is not possible.
- Netwrix provides a ""SetServerIP"" tool that can update the server address on existing clients without requiring a full uninstall.
- For a clean migration, either the SetServerIP tool should be used, or the agent should be uninstalled using the official uninstaller before reinstalling the new package.","","","","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-05-22T15:24:59.000Z"
