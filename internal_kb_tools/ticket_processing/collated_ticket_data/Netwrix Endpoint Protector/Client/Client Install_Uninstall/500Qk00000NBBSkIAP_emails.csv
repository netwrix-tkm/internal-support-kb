Hi Joseph,

Yes, older EPP clients are compatible with newer EPP server versions. We do however recommend, when possible, to upgrade them also, in order to have the latest features, enhancements and fixes available.

Hi Joseph,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we provided you with a silent uninstall script and then used the branded EPP client installer and it worked.

We will wait for you to test this out on a larger number of computers.
