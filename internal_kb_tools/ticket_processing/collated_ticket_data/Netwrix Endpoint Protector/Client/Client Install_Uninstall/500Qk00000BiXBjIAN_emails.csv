Please find below the answers to you questions and the script:

1. The script mentioned in the documentation link is the options.sh script. I will attach it to this email. Please also find below instructions on how to configure the script with the information needed:

After you download the client and extract it, please edit options.sh to remove # from the lines below.

Also replace ""set.this.to.the.endpointprotector.server.com"" with your EPP server IP

#EPPCLIENT_WS_SERVER=set.this.to.the.endpointprotector.server.com
#export EPPCLIENT_WS_SERVER

#EPPCLIENT_WS_PORT=443
#export EPPCLIENT_WS_PORT

#EPPCLIENT_DEPARTMENT_CODE=defdep
#export EPPCLIENT_DEPARTMENT_CODE

Save the changed file.
Install the EPP client using the install.sh file.

2. If you are referring to the ""set_epp_client_server.sh"" this is not needed. The options.sh script is needed because it contains the IP/DNS/FQDN to which the EPP clients will connect to.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.

The installation steps should be the same. I checked the FAT and the regular Rheel 8.9 client and there is a Readme.txt file with the installation commands. What remains to be done is to edit the options.sh file(present in the download links) as mentioned in the previous email by de-commenting the lines in the file.

I will also add here the download links for both the FAT and non-FAT versions:
Rhel 8.9 FAT: http://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EppClient_v2.4.2.1006/EPPClient_rhel_8.9_v2.4.2.1006_x86_64_deps.tar.gz

Hi Sam,

The installation steps should be the same. I checked the FAT and the regular Rheel 8.9 client and there is a Readme.txt file with the installation commands. What remains to be done is to edit the options.sh file(present in the download links) as mentioned in the previous email by de-commenting the lines in the file.

I will also add here the download links for both the FAT and non-FAT versions:
Rhel 8.9 FAT: http://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EppClient_v2.4.2.1006/EPPClient_rhel_8.9_v2.4.2.1006_x86_64_deps.tar.gz

Thank you for the information. It looks like our email security tool stripped any attachments you may have included. Do you have another way to share them with me? 

 

Also, I believe we were given a fat/thick client from Christian that included all of the dependencies. Does the installation process change for that RPM?

After you download the client and extract it, please edit  options.sh to remove # from the lines below.

Also replace ""set.this.to.the.endpointprotector.server.com"" with your EPP server IP

#EPPCLIENT_WS_SERVER=set.this.to.the.endpointprotector.server.com
#export EPPCLIENT_WS_SERVER

#EPPCLIENT_WS_PORT=443
#export EPPCLIENT_WS_PORT

#EPPCLIENT_DEPARTMENT_CODE=defdep
#export EPPCLIENT_DEPARTMENT_CODE

Save the changed file.
Install the EPP client using the  install.sh file.

2. If you are referring to the ""set_epp_client_server.sh"" this is not needed. The options.sh script is needed because it contains the IP/DNS/FQDN to which the EPP clients will connect to.

Please let me know if there is any other information that we can provide.
