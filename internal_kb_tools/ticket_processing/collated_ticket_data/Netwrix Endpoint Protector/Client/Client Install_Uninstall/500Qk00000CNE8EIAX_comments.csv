Hello! @Andre Wayne Le Roux 

This issue is not reproducable. I have seen it only once, but even then, a simple restart of the PC resolved it.
Is the customer having this constantly, even after restart?

@WaitingOnEngineer please ensure that the ZapEpp tool is the latest available version. Please use the version on the ZapEpp tool that is not completely silent 
(we also have a version that does not produce any output).

Open a command line terminal ""as admin"" and run the ZapEpp tool in that terminal. Then copy the output form that terminal and send it to us.

You may also try to see if the EPP agent installation is possible after running the tool and rebooting the PC.

Thank you for the response.  The ZAP tool that we used is download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/EppServicesZap.zip
 
We have tried numerous of times to run this and restart the endpoint machine but still get the same message when attempting to install the EPP client. 

The message error is ""Service 'Endpoint Protector' (Endpoint Protector) failed to start.  Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services""

They are getting this message from the user who is administrator, with full admin privileges.
 
Can you provide us the latest version of the ZAP tool that is not silent?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-14T14:18:06.000Z","2024-10-14T14:18:06.000Z","false","false"

Today we managed to solve the issue in a remote session. After we ran the non silent ZAP tool we installed the client via command line.
The customer is happy now that the issue is resolved, the case can now be de-escalated and closed.

@Robert Zavalczki: Thank you for your help on this.  Your efforts and help made it possible for use to solve this case and close it.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-18T12:20:05.000Z","2024-10-18T12:20:05.000Z","false","false"
