"500Qk00000Ji2PlIAJ","00430356","Support Ticket","Exit code 1603 while trying to install Endpoint Protector 5.6.11 or 6.2.4.1003","We are currently working to update our laptops from Endpoint Protector 5.6.11 to 6.2.4.1003 using Intune as MDM, but in our pilot group of laptops, 2 of them are showing the exit code 1603, that means any conflicting app is interrupting the installation. We already deleted any registry keys of previous installations or attempts to install related to the appID or searching by titles containing ""endpoint protector"" but the issues is still happening. Can you help us to detect if there are any leftover folders, files or registry keys that can cause this issue?","","","","Customer was provided with the Zap tool","","Andrei Pop","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","20.0","Closed - Resolved","Software GmbH","Alan Reis","2024-12-19T15:54:11.000Z","2025-01-08T15:41:43.000Z"
