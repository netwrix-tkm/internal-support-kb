I'm creating current ticket on behalf of Klarna team that is currently in the process of removing the EPP client from their computers. They reached out to me with the following question: 
Is there a script you guys have that can be used to force remove without the password requirement since the server will be terminated soon?

Klarna has the EPP client installed on Windows and macOS computers and the license is already expired. Furthermore, multiple computers may be offline at the moment so a Client Uninstall action with an active license will not cover such cases.

Let us know if other details would be needed.

Thank you,

They need to allow at least 1 full minute to run.
For macOS they can use the script ""remove-epp_nopwd_13_01_2022.command.zip"", they will need to run this script with sudo privileges.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-10T13:02:43.000Z"

Klarna has the EPP client installed on Windows and macOS computers and the license is already expired. Furthermore, multiple computers may be offline at the moment so a Client Uninstall action with an active license will not cover such cases.

They also will need to uninstall from devices that are NOT currently online, and may not be online till the server stays on live, i.e, may not get the updated uninstall password.  Both Windows and macOS.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-10T13:06:26.000Z"
