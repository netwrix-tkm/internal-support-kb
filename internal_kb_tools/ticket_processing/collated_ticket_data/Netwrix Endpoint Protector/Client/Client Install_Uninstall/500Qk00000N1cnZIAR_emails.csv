Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N1cnZ:ref



Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server? 

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

As per our remote session, we were able to remove the installation from one of the 50 problematic servers/laptops and install the EPP client on this server without further issue. Please confirm that you will use this tool on the rest of the 49 machines and that the users will not use the zap tool, and that it is only a tool for administrators.

Also please let me know if you run into issues after running this tool and attempting to reinstall the EPP client software on these machines.

Thank you for your time.

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server? 

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Issues installing client [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N1cnZ:ref ]

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server?

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Hello Hailey,
Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server?

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

I hope you’re doing well. The EPP uninstall tool is generally provided for exceptional cases and is typically used one at a time for uninstallation. Although I’ve heard of customers using an MDM solution to remove multiple agents simultaneously, I don’t have specific documentation on creating those scripts.

If you need to uninstall EPP from an individual device via the command line, you can use the following msiexec command:

msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Let me know if you have further questions or need further assistance.

Thank you.

Yeah I am having issues with mass deploying the installer out to computers since there is no documentation but I am unsure if you are able to help me with that or if I have to figure it out myself?

Hello Hailey,

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server? 

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Haley,

I hope you’re doing well. The EPP uninstall tool is generally provided for exceptional cases and is typically used one at a time for uninstallation. Although I’ve heard of customers using an MDM solution to remove multiple agents simultaneously, I don’t have specific documentation on creating those scripts.

If you need to uninstall EPP from an individual device via the command line, you can use the following msiexec command:

msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Let me know if you have further questions or need further assistance.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Yeah I am having issues with mass deploying the installer out to computers since there is no documentation but I am unsure if you are able to help me with that or if I have to figure it out myself?

Hello Hailey,

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N1cnZ:ref


Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hello Haley,

I hope you’re doing well. The EPP uninstall tool is generally provided for exceptional cases and is typically used one at a time for uninstallation. Although I’ve heard of customers using an MDM solution to remove multiple agents simultaneously, I don’t have specific documentation on creating those scripts.

If you need to uninstall EPP from an individual device via the command line, you can use the following msiexec command:

msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Let me know if you have further questions or need further assistance.

Thank you.

Yeah I am having issues with mass deploying the installer out to computers since there is no documentation but I am unsure if you are able to help me with that or if I have to figure it out myself?

Hello Hailey,

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Thank you.

Hello Haley,

I hope you're doing well. The EPP uninstall tool is generally provided for exceptional cases and is typically used one at a time for uninstallation. Although I've heard of customers using an MDM solution to remove multiple agents simultaneously, I don't have specific documentation on creating those scripts.

If you need to uninstall EPP from an individual device via the command line, you can use the following msiexec command:

msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Let me know if you have further questions or need further assistance.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hello Hailey,

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the ""/?"" parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N1cnZ:ref


Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren't communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it's a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hello Haley,

I hope you’re doing well. The EPP uninstall tool is generally provided for exceptional cases and is typically used one at a time for uninstallation. Although I’ve heard of customers using an MDM solution to remove multiple agents simultaneously, I don’t have specific documentation on creating those scripts.

If you need to uninstall EPP from an individual device via the command line, you can use the following msiexec command:

msiexec.exe /x ""path_to_msi"" ADMIN_PASSWORD_0=""your_uninstall_password"" REBOOT=ReallySuppress REMOVE_PROP=1 /qn

Let me know if you have further questions or need further assistance.

Thank you.

Yeah I am having issues with mass deploying the installer out to computers since there is no documentation but I am unsure if you are able to help me with that or if I have to figure it out myself?

Hello Hailey,

Thank you for your inquiry. Although you can potentially use msiexec to mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent, we unfortunately do not have exact documentation on how to do this. We also cannot provide detailed instructions or scenarios for msiexec usage.

If you choose to proceed, you may find general msiexec documentation helpful (for example, using the “/?” parameter to view available command-line options), but please note that we do not have a specific guide for deploying our Zap tool in bulk.

Should you need any further assistance or have additional questions, please let us know.

Thank you.

Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer

Hey Ramon,

Is there any documentation how I can mass deploy the Zap tool and then install the agent? I am trying to come up with scripts myself but I am unsure if this is the correct way and would like to follow documentation from you guys.

Hey Ramon,

There are a handful of computers/servers that aren’t communicating and need to be reinstalled. Basically, we ran into an issue with license and when it finally got fixed we had servers and computers that went offline or completely got removed from the console so I have to go back and fix the offline computers/servers and do a reinstall on computers that got completely removed.

The msi installer seems to be pointing to an old folder that is no longer in use which is what I assume is the issue here, but I am unsure why its pointing to this old folder since it’s a fresh download from the console.

I am available 2pm-4pm est March 18th and free all tomorrow 9am-3pm est march 19th.

Hello Ebenezer,

My name is Ramon with Netwrix Technical Support and I have been assigned to this case. Will you please tell me the total number of computers/laptops that are not able to install the EPP client, and how many terminal servers that are no longer communicating with the EPP server? 

What are your available days and times to schedule a remote session from Tuesday March 18th to Friday March 21st? Please include your time zone.

Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Ramon Torres | Technical Support Engineer
