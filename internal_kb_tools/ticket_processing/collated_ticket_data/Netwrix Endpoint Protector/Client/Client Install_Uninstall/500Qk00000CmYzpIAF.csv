Our license has expired and we are not looking to renew, but we need to script an uninstall of the client software off of several Windows endpoints.  Is there an MSI file, set of commands, or script we can run on the computers themselves to remove the Endpoint Protector software from the installed programs on the Windows endpoint?
Thank you","","","","uninstall script sent to customer","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Install/Uninstall","","","0.1","Closed - Resolved","InformedDNA","Julian Molina-Goni","2024-07-08T14:34:58.000Z","2024-07-08T17:06:47.000Z"
