Were trying to remove the USB Endpoint Protector from our systems, however we've discovered that a large number of machines (approx 100) still have it installed.  We've tried to automate the uninstallation via scripts but none of them successfully uninstall the product.  Please can you provide assistance to help us remove this produce from our systems.

Regards
