We don't have an msi file, only an exe and a script.
Please find an archived .vbs file in the below link, for the silent uninstall of the EPP Client on Windows: http://download.endpointprotector.com/debug_agent/epp_uninstall.zip

If you have an uninstall protection password, enter it in the uninstall_password line, according to the instructions, before running the .vbs. This tool is meant to be run via the command line or via a GPO and would be best to reboot the machines that have received the uninstall command.

Thank you for calling back, and sorry for missing your call.
We are having trouble uninstalling Endpoint Protector.
As you said, we sent the uninstall command, and the computers still have it installed.
We want to try uninstalling using the command prompt, but we need the file msi file name and the path.
If you have another suggestion about how to uninstall remotely,

We have a script that can uninstall the client from Macs.
Before we can send over the mentioned script, we need your written confirmation that the script will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the script will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi Alfredo,

We have a script that can uninstall the client from Macs.
Before we can send over the mentioned script, we need your written confirmation that the script will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the script will not be shared with any third parties.

Dear Botond Biro or support department person reviewing this ticket,
We have not heard back on the client removal script for macs.  We have confirmed that only the superAdministrator will use this to remove on Mac clients and will not be shared by 3rd parties once we successfully complete this process.

We had notified our customer on 7/11/24 that we'd hear back from your support team within the next 24-48 hours. Can we please obtain the script to move forward?

Please advise.  Thank you.

Hi Alfredo,

We have a script that can uninstall the client from Macs.
Before we can send over the mentioned script, we need your written confirmation that the script will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the script will not be shared with any third parties.

Dear Botond Biro or support department person reviewing this ticket,

We have not heard back on the client removal script for macs.  We have confirmed that only the superAdministrator will use this to remove on Mac clients and will not be shared by 3rd parties once we successfully complete this process.

 

We had notified our customer on 7/11/24 that we’d hear back from your support team within the next 24-48 hours. Can we please obtain the script to move forward?

 

Please advise.  Thank you.

 

 

Best –
