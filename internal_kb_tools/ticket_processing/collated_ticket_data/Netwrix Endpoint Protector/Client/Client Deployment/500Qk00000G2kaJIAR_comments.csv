@WaitingOnEngineer 
Pop-up related to ""Local Network""

The pop-up related to ""Local Network"" was a bug from Apple which was solved in next Apple releases after 15.0 (tested with 15.1 and everything works as expected). The pop-up was displayed when the enumeration of the printer was made (network and local printer) (the functionality of the epp was NOT affected, even if the user pressed on don't allow or allow).

Pop-up related to ""Bluetooth""

Related to Bluetooth this should never be displayed.
If the customer can replicate the issue please collect eppclient.log file (because when the agent starts, the bluetooth setting is checked).
This pop-up was displayed on simple upgrade/fresh install?
This pop-up was displayed is disaplyed on every tested machines?

The uploaded file is: instalation log file.
In my previsious comment I mentioned eppclient.log file. (not the same)

!!! like a general rule: please be aware and all the time try to install the latest agent.

Please create the eppclient.log file (or eppclient_append.log file in /var/log/) and after please install the agent.

@WaitingOnEngineer
I managed to replicate the problem.

The bluetooth pop-up is displayed because the agent doesnâ€™t have full disk access property enabled. The most of our customers install the agent using third party solutions (MDM solutions and from this solution the full disk access is granted).

The problem here appears when the agent try to register for bluetooth notifications: the bluetooth pop-up right cannot be manipulated by the daemon => when the agent tries to register notifications the pop-up is displayed.


What the customer wants? (to NOT display the pop-up at all?)

!!! If we will change the behaviour the pop-up will be never displayed -> admin can check in logs (server logs) if the bluetooth control was granted (this is the wanted behaviour?)
