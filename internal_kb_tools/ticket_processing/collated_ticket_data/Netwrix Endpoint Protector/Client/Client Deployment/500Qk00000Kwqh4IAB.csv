"500Qk00000Kwqh4IAB","00433229","Support Ticket","MDM settings?","Hello 
We are using an MDM solution (Mosyle) for our MAC workstations to set system permissions for applications. Is there a support document available that lists all of the permission and settings that need to be set when using Endpoint Protector on macOS devices?
I found this document (<a href='https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_User_Manual_5209_EN.pdf' target='_blank'>https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_User_Manual_5209_EN.pdf</a>) but note sure if this is still applicable with later versions of Endpoint Protector.
I appreciate your help.","","We have provided the link to our latest JAMF deployment guide.","We are waiting for the customer's feedback","The customer requested the latest documentation for JAMF deployment, and we have provided the link to it on our documentation site https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm","","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Deployment","","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Peabody Essex Museum (PEM)","Sean Pyburn","2025-01-22T19:51:26.000Z","2025-01-29T20:47:56.000Z"
