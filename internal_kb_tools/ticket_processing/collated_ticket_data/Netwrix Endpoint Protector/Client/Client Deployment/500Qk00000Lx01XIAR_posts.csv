Please note we are using Microsoft Intune for the Mac Deployments and the script provided by Netwrix seems like not working.
 
Scenario 1 :  The Server and Port Address : Not Set
 
We tried to run the script to point this to the right server and the script running successfully on local mac and it’s not able to set the server and port address to the EPP Client.
 
Scenario 2 : Deployed Using Intune
 
The package deployed using intune and running the same script from intune but it’s not able to set the server and port address to the EPP Client.
 
Seems Like the provided script is not able to set the server address properly via Intune and Locally.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-16T13:47:58.000Z"
