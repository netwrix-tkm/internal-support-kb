We are BDSoftware, a partner from India. Some of our customers are using Endpoint Protector and wish to install the software on Linux machines. However, the provided link (<a href='https://www.endpointprotector.com/linux' target='_blank'>https://www.endpointprotector.com/linux</a>) is not working, and we are unable to submit the request.

We kindly request you to share all the Linux version download links with us. If that's not possible at the moment, please provide the link for Ubuntu 23.04 specifically.","","","","Resolved by sending the client links","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Deployment","NONE","5940","0.0","Closed - Resolved","BD Software Distribution Pvt Ltd","Pravin Bhatuse","2024-09-25T12:26:36.000Z","2024-09-25T12:50:50.000Z"
