"500Qk00000LCn0tIAD","00433944","Support Ticket","Licensing Issue of Windows and Linux devices","Dear Team,

We have received a report from one of our customers regarding an issue with licensing. The customer has purchased 400 licenses, with 200 allocated for Windows devices and 200 for Linux devices. 

However, the customer has installed the EPP agent on more than 200 Windows devices, and all of them are showing as ""Online."" Additionally, they have successfully installed the EPP agent on 135 Linux devices. 

The concern raised is that, despite purchasing only 200 licenses for Linux, the customer is able to install the agent on Windows devices, which seems to be in conflict with the license allocation. The customer is asking why this is happening, especially since they have paid separately for Linux licenses.

Could you please investigate this issue and provide a detailed response at your earliest convenience?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.","","","","fixed  with sales","","Daniel Anton","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Deployment","","","29.9","Closed - Resolved","BD Software Distribution Pvt Ltd","Sakshi Sable","2025-01-29T09:25:39.000Z","2025-02-28T07:42:36.000Z"
