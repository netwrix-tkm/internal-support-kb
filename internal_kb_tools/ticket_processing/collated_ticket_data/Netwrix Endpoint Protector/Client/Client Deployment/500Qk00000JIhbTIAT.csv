"500Qk00000JIhbTIAT","00429335","Support Ticket","Macbooks not connecting to EPP","EPP clinet was installed on 4 macbooks with the same OS version and same network. 2 macbooks connected and 2 macbooks didn't connect. Checked traffic between macbook and server and there is no block.","1. Install the Epp client with the poxy enabled.","As we saw during our session, when the client is installed, and the proxy is enabled, the client will take the configuration of the proxy and it will not communicate with the server.
When the proxy is disabled, the newly installed client will communicate with the server.
We found 2 workarounds for this issue:
1. to install the client without the proxy enabled. and after it is installed, to enable it.
2. to remove from /etc/epp/options.ini the line for the proxy and also the ""cert.xxxxx..."" file from the same folder. The client could communicate with the server after that.","","We installed the client without the proxy enabled. and after it is installed, to enable it.","","Andrei Pop","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Deployment","NONE","","48.2","Closed - Resolved","Dubai Police","Fakhra Abdulla","2024-12-10T04:30:17.000Z","2025-01-27T09:10:45.000Z"
