From the log we can tell that either the EPP server or the proxy server is not accessible.

On the computer where the EPP agent is running, can they access this URL:

https://10.26.222.101/index.php

from a web browser? What if they configure the web-browser to use the HTTPS proxy server:Â  172.30.0.22, on port 8080 can they access the above URL?

Regarding the configuration of the proxy server in proxy settings in MacOS.
It will not help us. That because the management server is on premises and proxy will try to look for it externaly.

Please check that the Endpoint protector server at 10.26.222.101 is reachable from
the proxy server at 172.30.0.22. Are the Endpoint Protector server and the proxy server in the same network?


To test the reachability open a terminal and run this command:

So they do acknowledge that the server is not reachable from the proxy as they are in different networks. Then why even use the proxy setting when installing the EPP agent. @WaitingOnEngineer

Based on the logs, unless the EPP server is not running, this is the customer's networking problem and not our issue.

A private IP address can't be accessed from the internet. If their proxy server is on the internet (or in a different network) it won't be able to reach the EPP server in a different private network.

They should sort out their networking issues by themselves. Also the latest logs are redacted and the involved IP addresses are not visible.

As we saw during our session, when the client is installed, and the proxy is enabled, the client will take the configuration of the proxy and it will not communicate with the server.
When the proxy is disabled, the newly installed client will communicate with the server.
We found 2 workarounds for this issue:
1. to install the client without the proxy enabled. and after it is installed, to enable it.
2. to remove from /etc/epp/options.ini the line for the proxy and also the ""cert.xxxxx..."" file from the same folder. The client could communicate with the server after that.

As discussed with the customer, please let us know if we can provide a solution/script to the customer for the present issue.
Thank you again!","005Qk000001nViFIAU","2025-01-21T14:49:59.000Z","2025-01-21T14:49:59.000Z","false","false"

You can use the script from this location to run on macs and remove the proxy settings:

the script can be run as a stand-alone script or a part of a deployment. FYI: @WaitingOnEngineer
