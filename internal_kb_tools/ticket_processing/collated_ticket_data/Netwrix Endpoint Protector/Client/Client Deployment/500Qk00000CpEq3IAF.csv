"500Qk00000CpEq3IAF","00414443","Support Ticket","[IMDA - ACN - EPP] Device unable to connect to server after installing","Hi Support,

Good day!
We have a customer reporting their Windows Server client newly installed are not able to communicate with the server. They have installed the same client on 2 different Windows Servers within the same network.

They are able to telnet to port 443 of the server, they are able to access, which means it's not a network issue.

We are currently in the midst of checking with them on the status of their licenses, we suspect they may not have licenses available for the Windows Server computers, and we will get back to you on this.

Meanwhile, can we check with you if this is the default behavior for any new computers installed from a server, but there are no available licenses ?

Thank you!

They enabled TLS 1.2 on the windows machines and the issue is resolved.
