Please advise if EPP client version 6.2.3.1010 supports the new MacOS 15 Sequoia

Note, our server version is actually v5.9.4.0.

Could I also ask for a Linux client, please. I submitted a request for one via the Endpoint Protector site but haven't received a response on that yet.

I need a client for: Debian 12.1.

Kind regards
