"500Qk00000CcYZfIAN","00413926","Support Ticket","Debian 12 client","Hi team, Toshiba would like to strat a POC in Endpoint Protector, ideally this month, but are waiting for the Debian 12 client. Do we have any ETA for when we'll have this client? Can I make a request for the client through this ticket, or is there anywhere else I should write? 

Thanks a lot,
