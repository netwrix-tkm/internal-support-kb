Thank you for your patience!
I have the following update from the engineering team:

The bluetooth pop-up is displayed because the agent doesn’t have full disk access property enabled. Most of our customers install the agent using third party solutions (MDM solutions), and from this solution the full disk access is granted.
The problem here appears when the agent tries to register for bluetooth notifications: the bluetooth pop-up right cannot be manipulated by the daemon => when the agent tries to register notifications the pop-up is displayed.

They are asking if you wish for the pop-up to not be displayed at all?
If this behaviour is changed, the pop-up will be never displayed -> admin can check in logs (server logs) if the bluetooth control was granted.

I received a test build from the dev team which should not allow the pop-up to appear.
You can download it the the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp22112024/EPPMac3.0.4.0017.Notarized.tar

Since this is just a test build, please install it only on few computers, and let me know if it fixes the issue.
