@WaitingOnEngineer
After I opened the log file the first detected problem is:

13:22:14.138 f71db DEBUG  ES client initialization failed [cap/es_utils.cpp:38 logNewClientResult] -> this means the full disk access is NOT enabled (please open the log file and search for errror, it is impossible to NOT found the issue).

Also from the logs the used server is:
13:22:14.206 f71db INFO   Using server: c5fb7iu.hosted.endpointprotector.com:443 [base/EppContext.cpp:295 initialize]
-> this server was set on post install script (checked in image)

Why options.ini file was not attached?
The script file will modify the options.ini with the new set values. (you checked if the new value is present in options.ini file?)

Please try to enable the full disk access before to try to collect other data and check this information in logs.

Please open the eppclient.log file and observe the start and end time of the logs:

start time: 07:57:59.885

The server was set as expected in video:

Can you please check the 'Crash Reports' section in the Console application to see if any crash report was generated by EPPClient?
If the agent crashes, we will find information about the crash.


From the received information no error is detected in logs.

@WaitingOnEngineer

!!! I can't explain why full disk access is not enabled for the epp agent. (the epp agent not worked at all?)
I tried to replicate the problem, but I wasn't able to crash the agent.
Can you please try using the following script to change the IP?
The script can be downloaded from:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/EppTools/epp_change_ip_epp_run.zip

I believe the problem is related to the downloaded files which contains the file names which must to be blocked by the epp agent. (I wasn't able to fully replicate the issue, just analyzing the received logs.)

Please try to run the new script.
If NOT works please schedule a remote connection.
