As we prepare for the deployment of EPP client for Bank Aladin Syariah, we require an installation script for macOS endpoints that can be used with third-party deployment tools. We noticed that on the technical documentation currently provides guidance for JAMF. However, they are using FileWave as their deployment tool and would appreciate assistance installation script suitable for this platform or the template for JAMF that we can adjust to FileWave.

Thank you.
