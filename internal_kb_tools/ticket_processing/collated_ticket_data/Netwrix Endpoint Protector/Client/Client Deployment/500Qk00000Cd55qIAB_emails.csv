We hope you are doing well.

I have looked in our repository but we only have an older version of the  Amazon Linux 2 client. I will attach the download link to this ticket.

Download link:
AWS Linux2: https://download.endpointprotector.com/linux_agent/EPPClient_v1.8.0.0/EPPClient_Amazon_2_1806_x86_64.tar.gz

Please let us know if this works on your end.
