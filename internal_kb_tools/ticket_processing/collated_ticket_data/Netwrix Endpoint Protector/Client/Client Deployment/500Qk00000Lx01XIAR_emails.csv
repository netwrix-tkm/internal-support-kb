Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Aghillal,

The engineering team asked for a set of logs from a mac on which the ip change script is working.
I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Dear Robert,

 

Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.

 

Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Dear Andrei,

 

We ran the script with sudo and the output message was Setting the Server address and Done.

 

For Scenario 2, we followed the method provided by Netwrix and its not helping. We also tried to do this in post installation script method too natively from intune.

 

Requesting you to initiate a call and I can share the user screen to showcase the issue.

 

Im with the user right now

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?
[cid:image008.png@01DB98BB.95DD82B0]
Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,



Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.



How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Dear Robert,



Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.



Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Dear Andrei,



We ran the script with sudo and the output message was Setting the Server address and Done.



For Scenario 2, we followed the method provided by Netwrix and its not helping. We also tried to do this in post installation script method too natively from intune.



Requesting you to initiate a call and I can share the user screen to showcase the issue.



Im with the user right now





Best Regards,

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Aghillal,

The engineering team asked for a set of logs from a mac on which the ip change script is working.
I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Dear Robert,

 

Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.

 

Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Dear Robert,



Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.



Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?
[Inline image name : image008.png]
Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Dear Robert,

 

Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.

 

Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Hi Naveen,

Are you available tomorrow from 3:00pm UAE time?

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Aghillal,

The engineering team asked for a set of logs from a mac on which the ip change script is working.
I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Hi Aghillal,

I escalated this case to management and I will let you know as soon as I have any updates.
In the meantime, could you please let me know the macos version of the user with whom we had the remote session yesterday?

Dear Robert,

 

Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.

 

Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?
[cid:image008.png@01DB9CB2.308054B0]
Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,



Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.



How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

I don't have availability for tomorrow, but if I send you the steps, could you please send the logs over?

Dear Robert,



Requesting your support to escalate this to the team and get this resolved ASAP.



Currently we don’t have DLP Policies enabled for more than 100 mac devices and it’s a potential risk.

Hi Naveen,

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Please run the script again afterwards.

Subject: Re: Netwrix Support Ticket #435996 - - Mac OS Deployment Script is not working (Setting Server IP) [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Lx01X:ref ]

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #435996 - - Mac OS Deployment Script is not working (Setting Server IP) [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Lx01X:ref ]

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?
[cid:image008.png@01DB9E30.C079FB00]
Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,



Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.



How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Naveen,

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,

 

Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.

 

How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Naveen,

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

My colleagues found in the logs that Full Disk access is not enabled and that might be the reason why the IP is not getting set.
Could you please check on one of the macs and turn it on?

Please run the script again afterwards.

Hi Aghillal,

This should be done on a Mac on which the change IP script works. We need the logs from a Mac on which the script is working, so we can compare them.

You can also try the following commands to gather the logs:
1. sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
2. sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient.log
3. sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
4. Update policies
5. Run the change IP script
6. Update the policies
7. Copy logs to desktop:
cp /private/var/log/eppclient.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/options.ini ~/Desktop
cp /var/log/install.log ~/Desktop
8. Compress the logs and send them over via email.

Dear Team,



Here our issue itself is it’s not reporting to the console.



How can we update the policy if it’s not reporting and online?

Hi Naveen,

Our colleagues couldn't find anything wrong in the logs and asked us to check the crash report.
Are you available tomorrow from 3:00pm UAE time?

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #435996 - - Mac OS Deployment Script is not working (Setting Server IP) [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Lx01X:ref ]

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Best regards,

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script.

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Thanks!

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time today!
I'm glad we finally managed to make the script work on at least one machine.
As agreed during the call, please continue testing and let us know if the script runs correctly on the other Macs as well.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Naveen,

I found out how to suppress the Intercept VPN notification via Intune.
To auto enable the system extension without user interaction, please check out the below screenshot: 
[Inline image name : Image_2025-03-28_17-28-43.png]

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

 

Thanks!

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

 

Thanks!

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Best regards,

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply.

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck.

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I found out how to suppress the Intercept VPN notification via Intune.

To auto enable the system extension without user interaction, please check out the below screenshot:
[cid:image001.png@01DBA7BB.7D2D5F10]
The steps are listed below:

 1.  Select Devices -> macOS > Configuration profiles > Create profile
 2.  Select profile type as Templates and Extensions as template name
 3.  Complete the basics and go to configuration settings and select system extensions
 4.  Complete with data from ""extension"" image as listed in section 2.6 of the Jamf deployment manual: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script.

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Thanks!

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply. 

 

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck. 

 

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

 

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time today!
I'm glad we finally managed to make the script work on at least one machine.
As agreed during the call, please continue testing and let us know if the script runs correctly on the other Macs as well.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we already have upfront scheduled remote sessions scheduled until 3:00pm on Monday, we can schedule a call after that time.
If it's ok for you, we can schedule the remote session on Tuesday from: 12:00pm, 1:00pm or 3:00pm UAE on Tuesday.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply. 

 

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck. 

 

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time today!
I'm glad we finally managed to make the script work on at least one machine.
As agreed during the call, please continue testing and let us know if the script runs correctly on the other Macs as well.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for providing the script; it functioned effectively, allowing us to bring most of the machines online successfully.

However, it still requires the end user to ""Allow"" the Transparent Proxy, and Full Disk Access must be enabled manually.

If the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) considers these settings (Transparent Proxy and Full Disk Access) as essential for its optimal performance, it would be beneficial if you could provide a configuration profile. Relying on end users to manage these settings may not be the most effective approach, as they may disable them to circumvent the detection of malicious activity. Therefore, these configurations should happen in the background, without the user's awareness.

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply.

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck.

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I found out how to suppress the Intercept VPN notification via Intune.

To auto enable the system extension without user interaction, please check out the below screenshot:
[cid:image005.png@01DBB9CE.8CA70840]
The steps are listed below:

 1.  Select Devices -> macOS > Configuration profiles > Create profile
 2.  Select profile type as Templates and Extensions as template name
 3.  Complete the basics and go to configuration settings and select system extensions
 4.  Complete with data from ""extension"" image as listed in section 2.6 of the Jamf deployment manual: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for providing the script; it functioned effectively, allowing us to bring most of the machines online successfully.

 

However, it still requires the end user to ""Allow"" the Transparent Proxy, and Full Disk Access must be enabled manually. 

 

If the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) considers these settings (Transparent Proxy and Full Disk Access) as essential for its optimal performance, it would be beneficial if you could provide a configuration profile. Relying on end users to manage these settings may not be the most effective approach, as they may disable them to circumvent the detection of malicious activity. Therefore, these configurations should happen in the background, without the user's awareness.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply. 

 

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck. 

 

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time today!
I'm glad we finally managed to make the script work on at least one machine.
As agreed during the call, please continue testing and let us know if the script runs correctly on the other Macs as well.

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for providing the script; it functioned effectively, allowing us to bring most of the machines online successfully.

However, it still requires the end user to ""Allow"" the Transparent Proxy, and Full Disk Access must be enabled manually.

If the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) considers these settings (Transparent Proxy and Full Disk Access) as essential for its optimal performance, it would be beneficial if you could provide a configuration profile. Relying on end users to manage these settings may not be the most effective approach, as they may disable them to circumvent the detection of malicious activity. Therefore, these configurations should happen in the background, without the user's awareness.

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply.

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck.

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

Thanks!

Hi Naveen,

I found out how to suppress the Intercept VPN notification via Intune.

To auto enable the system extension without user interaction, please check out the below screenshot:
[cid:image005.png@01DBB9EF.CEA8C190]
The steps are listed below:

 1.  Select Devices -> macOS > Configuration profiles > Create profile
 2.  Select profile type as Templates and Extensions as template name
 3.  Complete the basics and go to configuration settings and select system extensions
 4.  Complete with data from ""extension"" image as listed in section 2.6 of the Jamf deployment manual: https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_Guide_EN.pdf

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script.

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Thanks!

Hi Aghillal,

The script was tested several times in house, and it is working without any issues, moreover, we can demonstrate this in a session to you.
Please not that this script is included in our user manual for JAMF, and it's being used by our customers for years now, without issues.
Considering the script is working on our end, and on other customers's end as well, please check if there were any modifications in your environment when the script stopped working. We're asking you to do this, because the script worked for you until it suddenly stopped working on all Macs.

In the meantime, please also send over the logs from today's remote session.

Hi Botond,

Thank you for providing the script; it functioned effectively, allowing us to bring most of the machines online successfully.

 

However, it still requires the end user to ""Allow"" the Transparent Proxy, and Full Disk Access must be enabled manually. 

 

If the Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) considers these settings (Transparent Proxy and Full Disk Access) as essential for its optimal performance, it would be beneficial if you could provide a configuration profile. Relying on end users to manage these settings may not be the most effective approach, as they may disable them to circumvent the detection of malicious activity. Therefore, these configurations should happen in the background, without the user's awareness.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thank you for the suggestion and for waiting patiently for our reply. 

 

We already tested these configurations with the old builds, but no luck. 

 

However, we will reconfigure, retest, and follow up.

 

Thanks!

Hi Botond,

Thanks for the new script. 

 

For sure, we will test on a few more Mac machines and revert asap. However, there can be a slight delay from our end due to EID.

Hi Naveen,

Thank you for your time today!
I'm glad we finally managed to make the script work on at least one machine.
As agreed during the call, please continue testing and let us know if the script runs correctly on the other Macs as well.
