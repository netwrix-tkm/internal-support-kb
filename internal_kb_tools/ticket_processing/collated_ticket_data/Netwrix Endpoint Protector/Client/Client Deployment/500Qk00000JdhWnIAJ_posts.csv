Greetings to you!

This is regarding the connection of EPP client and server. As soon as we install the client, it communicates once and then stops connecting and shows the IP as NOT SET and connection as YES, under Settings after pressing Ctrl+Alt+I. 

Note: At this point, the same PC is able to ping that server also able to reach the dashboard, using web browser, over https. 

The only difference in these PCs and other PCs in the environment is that these do not have internal network adapters, they uses third party network adapters, like TP link, Realtech, etc. 
I also allowed USB modem under Global rights, before reinstalling the client. Again, the icon blinked once and then stopped communicating.

I request you to please get over a call with the customer, on friday. If you agree, please let me know and I will confirm the timings with customer, for friday. 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks a lot. 

Regards, 
Milan Singh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-18T08:21:36.000Z"
