Hi Don,

Happy to hear that the license issue was finalized.

Please let me know if you have availability next week for a remote session so we can take a look over the remaining computers that have the issue. We would need access to one of the computers experiencing the issue in order to better investigate it.

Good afternoon Flaviu,
 

We were able to get the license count up to account for those devices not receiving the deployment. We are still noticing that some of the endpoints are struggling to receive the deployment even with extra licenses. Were you able to figure out any additional potential troubleshooting steps that we can take?

Hello Don,

Unfortunately, I can not help you with the additional licenses.

In order to identify if this could be the issue please check if the amount of used licensed is equal with the total number of licenses. You can access System Configuration -> System licensing for this.


If all the licenses are being used, I would recommend to enable the automatic license release for the computers which did not communicate with the server for a specific amount of time.
You can enable it from System Configuration -> System Licensing -> View Licenses -> scroll down to the bottom of the page -> Automatic license release -> enable the feature.

In the example below, all the computers which did not check in with the EPP Server for 30 days will have the licenses released automatically.


Let me know if this helps.

Thank you,
Emil

Emil,
 

Would you all be able to provide some extra licensing to see if that is indeed the issue here? We would be happy to discuss paying for those licenses, but in the past we were told that there wouldn't be a stop limit for our licenses if we went over, and that if any additional devices past that limit occurs we can discuss what the payment plan would look like. This is a huge blocker for my team, and not something that we were aware of previously.

Hey Emil, 
 

So it looks like that is the right address, from checking my settings compared to the devices that we are attempting to connect to. The user we are working with receives the icon when we push the agent, but it is showing as not connected when we run that command in the settings. The device shows up in the console as offline and unlicensed after this and does not progress.

Hey Emil,
 

We have an on-prem console, we are using https://aj8f11f.hosted.endpointprotector.com:443 in lieu of an IP for the agent to communicate with the server. Should we be inputting something else for this and where would I find that?

Hello Don,

If you have access to the computer where the EPP Client was installed, please open the EPP Client on the machine -> click on the settings tab -> press command+option+i on your keyboard and check if the EPP Client is using the correct IP in order to communicate with the server.

If the server's IP is not set then you will have to edit the POST Install JAMF Script and configure it with your server's IP. Then make sure that the post install script is also included in the package and try to reinstall the EPP Client.

Here is an example from our console. The engineer pushed an uninstall from the mdm yesterday. It was removed from the machine but still showing up like this in the console. He is now attempting to re-deploy the install from the mdm but we are still seeing the device show up as such.

Hi Flaviu, 
 

I appreciate you sending that over so fast! I did have another question. How long does it take for the console to recognize an agent uninstalling or installing before it shows in the console? We are attempting to test uninstalling from the mdm, and reinstalling as we have noticed that has worked with some other devices.

And to follow up to my last question. How can I go about setting up with a call with an engineer to talk with myself and our IT team through some of the issues that we are encountering?

Hi Flaviu, 
 

I appreciate you sending that over so fast! I did have another question. How long does it take for the console to recognize an agent uninstalling or installing before it shows in the console? We are attempting to test uninstalling from the mdm, and reinstalling as we have noticed that has worked with some other devices.
