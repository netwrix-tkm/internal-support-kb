Dekra have a tight timeline to deploy the EPP through GPO or SotiMobicontrol, they need to at least send the correct packages until day 31 of december. Which leaves us with only tomorrow to figure out ways to do it, they tried:
- Sending the classic EPP msi with the original name through both deploys.
- Editing with a MSI editor to make sure the IP is being applied.
- Tried this command to apply the parameters in the command line: <a href='https://msiexec.exe' target='_blank'>msiexec.exe</a> /i ""msiInstallerPath "" WSIP=""EPP_server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress
No option worked except by installing manually, which works everytime.

Let me know your opinion and availability to take a look together tomorrow.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-26T16:53:41.000Z"
