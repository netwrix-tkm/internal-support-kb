Hello,

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.
I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).
Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Hello,

 

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.

I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).

Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

 

Thanks,

Eyal

The screenshot I took is from another computer (a new installation).

This time this new computer does not even appears in the management console.

Do you want me to still try to uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hi,

I have some questions please:

  1.  The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?
  2.  The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

If I understand correct the link of events from this email thread, the communication between the client and server is available, then there is no need for the proxy.
Regarding the uninstallation password, please agree to the below disclaimer and I will share a script that will bypass that uninstall password:

Before we can send over the mentioned tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hi Alin,

 

Unfortunately the issue still persists.

Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.

When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

 

Thanks,

Hello,

If I understand correct the link of events from this email thread, the communication between the client and server is available, then there is no need for the proxy.
Regarding the uninstallation password, please agree to the below disclaimer and I will share a script that will bypass that uninstall password:

Hi,

I have some questions please:

1.       The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hello,

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.
I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).
Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Best regards,
Alin Anca

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hello,

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.
I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).
Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hello,

 

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.

I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).

Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

 

Thanks,

Eyal

Hi,

 

The screenshot I took is from another computer (a new installation).

This time this new computer does not even appears in the management console.

Do you want me to still try to uninstall it and install it again?

Eyal

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hi Alin,

 

Unfortunately the issue still persists.

Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.

When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

 

Thanks,

Hello,

If I understand correct the link of events from this email thread, the communication between the client and server is available, then there is no need for the proxy.
Regarding the uninstallation password, please agree to the below disclaimer and I will share a script that will bypass that uninstall password:

Before we can send over the mentioned tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi,

I have some questions please:

1.       The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

Thanks,
Eyal

I install the latest version of the client on macOS Sonoma but the agent is not connected to the mng server.
Based on what we see it is not the firewall and nothing that I can find.
Can you assist me for the first installation on the client on macOS?

Thank you!

Sorry about the delay, I have waited for the mail but unfortunately it was blocked in our mail relay systems because of it’s content (the script .command).

Hi,


	I am referring to the commend we used to test connection: curl -vvvvvv https://10.26.222.101/index.php --proxy 172.30.0.22:8080
	I confirm the below.

Hello,

If I understand correct the link of events from this email thread, the communication between the client and server is available, then there is no need for the proxy.
Regarding the uninstallation password, please agree to the below disclaimer and I will share a script that will bypass that uninstall password:

Before we can send over the mentioned tool, we need your written confirmation that the tool will only be used by one of the administrators, safely removed from the user's machine once it is not needed anymore and that the tool will not be shared with any third parties.

Hi,

 

I have some questions please:

1.       The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

 

Thanks,

Eyal

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hello,

 

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.

I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).

Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

 

Thanks,

Eyal

Hi,

 

The screenshot I took is from another computer (a new installation).

This time this new computer does not even appears in the management console.

Do you want me to still try to uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hi Alin,

 

Unfortunately the issue still persists.

Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.

When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

 

Thanks,

Hi,

I have some questions please:

1.       The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

Thanks,

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hi,

The screenshot I took is from another computer (a new installation).
This time this new computer does not even appears in the management console.
Do you want me to still try to uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
The last email that my colleagues sent regarding this issue was to perform an action on your side and to let us know the result after that, I will add the text again below:

Could you please run the following command in your Terminal and send us a screenshot with the result?

curl -vvvvvv https://10.26.222.101/index.php --proxy 172.30.0.22:8080

This is necessary for the engineering team to continue the investigation.

Hi Alin,

Unfortunately the issue still persists.
Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.
When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

Thanks,

Hi,

 

The screenshot I took is from another computer (a new installation).

This time this new computer does not even appears in the management console.

Do you want me to still try to uninstall it and install it again?

 

Regards,

Eyal

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
The last email that my colleagues sent regarding this issue was to perform an action on your side and to let us know the result after that, I will add the text again below:

Could you please run the following command in your Terminal and send us a screenshot with the result? 

curl -vvvvvv https://10.26.222.101/index.php --proxy 172.30.0.22:8080

This is necessary for the engineering team to continue the investigation.

Hi Alin,

 

Unfortunately the issue still persists.

Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.

When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

 

Thanks,

Eyal

Hello,

If I understand correct the link of events from this email thread, the communication between the client and server is available, then there is no need for the proxy.
Regarding the uninstallation password, please agree to the below disclaimer and I will share a script that will bypass that uninstall password:

Hi,

I have some questions please:

1.       The mng server is on the LAN, why does the client needs to go through proxy?

2.       The uninstallation password seems to by typed correctly in the mac computer (I have checked on notes). But if we do not see the computer in the mng console, how does he supposed to approve the uninstall password in the first place?

Thanks,

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Can it be that the uninstallation password is using very complex characters that the MacOS doesn't allow? Could you maybe try to have a less complex password and verify it that way?

Hello,

I'm having troubles uninstalling the agent.
I use the 'remove-app' file and when typing the uninstall password I get an error that the password is incorrect (I tried it on another windows computer and it worked).
Do I need to configure a different uninstall password to MacOS computers? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Hello,

Thank you for the screenshot.
We could see the output of the command. OK, so now the connection from the computer to the EPP server via the proxy works fine.
Did you also check if the EPP agent can reach the EPP server? Because it should work now.
If not, can you please uninstall it and install it again?

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
The last email that my colleagues sent regarding this issue was to perform an action on your side and to let us know the result after that, I will add the text again below:

Could you please run the following command in your Terminal and send us a screenshot with the result?

curl -vvvvvv https://10.26.222.101/index.php --proxy 172.30.0.22:8080

This is necessary for the engineering team to continue the investigation.

Hi Alin,

Unfortunately the issue still persists.
Ilya will not be available in the next month so I'll take charge of this ticket.
When can we schedule a meeting about the installation?

Thanks,

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
Please try to uninstall it and reinstall it, but after that, please perform a computer restart.
The EPP client should open after that, if not, please let me know your availability for tomorrow or next week to have a session together.

Best regards,

Hello,

 

I successfully uninstalled the agent but when install it again (version 3.0.3.1) I still can't see it on the management console.

In addition, I see the Cososys running but I I can't open the app itself:

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
As it's seen in the screenshot, you are requested for the admin user password for that macOS, not the uninstallation password.
You may also try to run the script with bash.

Best regards,
