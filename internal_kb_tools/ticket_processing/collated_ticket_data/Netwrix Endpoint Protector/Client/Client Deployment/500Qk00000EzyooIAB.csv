"500Qk00000EzyooIAB","00419301","Support Ticket","Last Server Connection: Unknown","Hey
I install the latest version of the client on macOS Sonoma but the agent is not connected to the mng server.
 Based on what we see it is not the firewall and nothing that I can find.
Can you assist me for the first installation on the client on macOS?","Install an EPP client on a computer that has proxy installed.","As we saw during our session, when the client is installed, and the proxy is enabled, the client will take the configuration of the proxy and it will not communicate with the server.
When the proxy is disabled, the newly installed client will communicate with the server.
We found 2 workarounds for this issue:
1. to install the client without the proxy enabled. and after it is installed, to enable it.
2. to remove from /etc/epp/options.ini the line for the proxy and also the ""cert.xxxxx..."" file from the same folder. The client could communicate with the server after that.","Alex to discuss the root cause with Robert and deliver a solution to us.","2 possible workarounds, please see below:
1. I will attach a download link to an MacOS proxy configuration script, please make sure to set up inside of it a fake Proxy IP and port, run it on a computer that has the client installed, and the client should communicate with the server normally.

2. When you install the client manual, in the manual settings you should enter a fake Proxy IP and port and the client should communicate with the server normally.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Alin Anca","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client Deployment","","","181.9","Closed - Resolved","MAX IT Finance LTD","ilya Budyak","2024-08-27T16:36:38.000Z","2025-02-25T14:08:08.000Z"
