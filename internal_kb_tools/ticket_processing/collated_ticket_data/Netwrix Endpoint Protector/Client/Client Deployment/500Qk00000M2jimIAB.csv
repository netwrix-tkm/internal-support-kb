"500Qk00000M2jimIAB","00436230","Support Ticket","Pushing EPP agent thru Hexnode","We are trying to push EPP agent on our employees devices thru Hexnode. We worked with Hexnode and they said everything is done on their end. When we push the policy, the agent installs on the user's device, but they do not pop up on the EPP console. I followed the Jamf guide from Netwrix and I cannot get it to work. I am free for a Zoom Meeting at anytime during PST hours tomorrow or Thursday. Please let me know.","","Customer will raise issue with Hexnode support
