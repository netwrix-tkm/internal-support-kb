We are using an MDM solution (Mosyle) for our MAC workstations to set system permissions for applications. Is there a support document available that lists all of the permission and settings that need to be set when using Endpoint Protector on macOS devices?
I found this document (<a href='https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_User_Manual_5209_EN.pdf' target='_blank'>https://www.endpointprotector.com/support/pdf/manual/Endpoint_Protector_5_JAMF_Deployment_User_Manual_5209_EN.pdf</a>) but note sure if this is still applicable with later versions of Endpoint Protector.
I appreciate your help.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-22T19:51:27.000Z"
