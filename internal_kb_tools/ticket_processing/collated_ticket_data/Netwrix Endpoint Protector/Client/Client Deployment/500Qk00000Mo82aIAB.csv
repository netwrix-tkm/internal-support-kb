"500Qk00000Mo82aIAB","00438440","Support Ticket","Sluggish performance and black screens - EPP client 6.2.4.200 installed on the same day Windows updates were applied","Hi Team,

I'm creating current support ticket on behalf of customer London Borough of Merton Council.
Abhishek has reached out to me with the following feedback:

""I wanted to report an issue we've encountered since rolling out Endpoint Protector 6.2.4.200 to all our devices last Thursday. So far, around 50 users have reported experiencing very sluggish performance and black screens following the Windows updates. We attempted to resolve the issue by removing the KB that was pushed on Thursday, but the devices remained sluggish and practically unusable.

Interestingly, when I uninstalled the Endpoint Client on these affected devices, their performance returned to normal immediately. However, after reinstalling the Endpoint Client, the devices worked smoothly again. I'm really unsure what might have caused this issue, as it appears that all the affected devices had Windows updates installed on the same day we rolled out the Endpoint Client. In contrast, devices that were not affected seemed to have received the Windows update before Thursday.

I wanted to reach out to see if this is something you have witnessed in the past, or if you have any insight into what might be causing this issue.""

@Abhishek Kunwar<Abhishek.Kunwar@merton.gov.uk> Please also assist with the following details for our team to have a full picture on the behavior that you described to me:
- what Windows version is used on these 50 computers? 
- what is the method that your team used for installing the Endpoint Protector client version 6.2.4.200 on these computers? 
- were these computers rebooted after the installation of the Endpoint Protector client and/or of Windows updates? 


@Support Team: Can you please advise if this behavior was reported before? Can you please advise if other details would be needed to look into the reported behavior? 

Thank you,
