How was the Epp client distributed?
Can you please confirm if the issue resolves by manually resinstalling the Epp client?
To further look into this, can you please take a set of logs from an affected computer following the steps below?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Confirm the slowness issue is present.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for reaching out. The EPP client was distributed using Microsoft Intune. We have successfully resolved the issues by manually installing or reinstalling the EPP client. At the moment, I don't have any affected devices to capture logs, but I will certainly do so if the same issue is reported again. Have you encountered this issue before and any other companies reported to you?

HI Andrei,

We converted the MSI into  Win32 EPPClientSetup.6.2.4.2.intunewin<https://intune.microsoft.com/?ref=AdminCenter> - as this gave more autofill options than using  Line-of-business app and we more than 2000 devices and around only 60  devices had an impact.

Hi support,


I hope you're doing well. I wanted to report an issue we've encountered since rolling out Endpoint Protector 6.2.4.200 to all our devices last Thursday. So far, around 50 users have reported experiencing very sluggish performance and black screens following the Windows updates. We attempted to resolve the issue by removing the KB that was pushed on Thursday, but the devices remained sluggish and practically unusable.



Interestingly, when I uninstalled the Endpoint Client on these affected devices, their performance returned to normal immediately. However, after reinstalling the Endpoint Client, the devices worked smoothly again. I'm really unsure what might have caused this issue, as it appears that all the affected devices had Windows updates installed on the same day we rolled out the Endpoint Client. In contrast, devices that were not affected seemed to have received the Windows update before Thursday.



I wanted to reach out to see if this is something you have witnessed in the past, or if you have any insight into what might be causing this issue.

This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Confirm the slowness issue is present.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.

Hi support,


I hope you're doing well. I wanted to report an issue we've encountered since rolling out Endpoint Protector 6.2.4.200 to all our devices last Thursday. So far, around 50 users have reported experiencing very sluggish performance and black screens following the Windows updates. We attempted to resolve the issue by removing the KB that was pushed on Thursday, but the devices remained sluggish and practically unusable.



Interestingly, when I uninstalled the Endpoint Client on these affected devices, their performance returned to normal immediately. However, after reinstalling the Endpoint Client, the devices worked smoothly again. I'm really unsure what might have caused this issue, as it appears that all the affected devices had Windows updates installed on the same day we rolled out the Endpoint Client. In contrast, devices that were not affected seemed to have received the Windows update before Thursday.



I wanted to reach out to see if this is something you have witnessed in the past, or if you have any insight into what might be causing this issue.

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for reaching out. The EPP client was distributed using Microsoft Intune. We have successfully resolved the issues by manually installing or reinstalling the EPP client. At the moment, I don't have any affected devices to capture logs, but I will certainly do so if the same issue is reported again. Have you encountered this issue before and any other companies reported to you?

Hello,

How was the Epp client distributed?
Can you please confirm if the issue resolves by manually resinstalling the Epp client?
To further look into this, can you please take a set of logs from an affected computer following the steps below?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip__;!!HK5oVgSobt9mFQ!cUtah9XSzhVKH9yA6IXrwqBub9U9iDwuU60qYUKJiakwWVo-_TcT5hN29vYPf3W8sqCOLrMiLTJ4R57nFMrztzdWukYfNPTkag$>
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Confirm the slowness issue is present.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,
I hope you are doing well! Although I initially agreed to close the support request, I have got  another device exhibiting the same problems. As per your instructions, I have collected the relevant logs from the affected device and have attached them to this email for your review.
It would be quite insightful to see if there is any information within these logs that might help us pinpoint the root cause of this recurring issue.

Hello Andrei,
Yes remained the same after device reboot.  As mentioned in my previous email, during the rollout of the EPP client, the affected devices also had Windows updates installed on the same day. This overlap made it difficult to determine whether the issues were caused by the EPP client or the Windows updates. Interestingly, uninstalling the suspected KB didn't improve the situation, but reinstalling the EPP client did.
It remains unclear if the problem stems from the EPP client or the Windows updates.

Hi Andrei,

I hope you are doing well! Although I initially agreed to close the support request, I have got  another device exhibiting the same problems. As per your instructions, I have collected the relevant logs from the affected device and have attached them to this email for your review.

It would be quite insightful to see if there is any information within these logs that might help us pinpoint the root cause of this recurring issue.

Hi support,


I hope you're doing well. I wanted to report an issue we've encountered since rolling out Endpoint Protector 6.2.4.200 to all our devices last Thursday. So far, around 50 users have reported experiencing very sluggish performance and black screens following the Windows updates. We attempted to resolve the issue by removing the KB that was pushed on Thursday, but the devices remained sluggish and practically unusable.



Interestingly, when I uninstalled the Endpoint Client on these affected devices, their performance returned to normal immediately. However, after reinstalling the Endpoint Client, the devices worked smoothly again. I'm really unsure what might have caused this issue, as it appears that all the affected devices had Windows updates installed on the same day we rolled out the Endpoint Client. In contrast, devices that were not affected seemed to have received the Windows update before Thursday.



I wanted to reach out to see if this is something you have witnessed in the past, or if you have any insight into what might be causing this issue.

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for reaching out. The EPP client was distributed using Microsoft Intune. We have successfully resolved the issues by manually installing or reinstalling the EPP client. At the moment, I don't have any affected devices to capture logs, but I will certainly do so if the same issue is reported again. Have you encountered this issue before and any other companies reported to you?

Hi Andrei,
I hope you are well. Thank you for your thorough inspection of the logs. Since no errors or problematic actions were found, I believe the issue was likely a conflict between the Windows updates and the EPP client. Given this, please go ahead and close the request if it is still open.

Hello,

Are there any policies applied on the affected computer from the Epp server?
Or maybe is it possible to reproduce if you try to install the update or KB again?

Hello Andrei,

Yes remained the same after device reboot.  As mentioned in my previous email, during the rollout of the EPP client, the affected devices also had Windows updates installed on the same day. This overlap made it difficult to determine whether the issues were caused by the EPP client or the Windows updates. Interestingly, uninstalling the suspected KB didn't improve the situation, but reinstalling the EPP client did.

It remains unclear if the problem stems from the EPP client or the Windows updates.

Hi Andrei,

I hope you are doing well! Although I initially agreed to close the support request, I have got  another device exhibiting the same problems. As per your instructions, I have collected the relevant logs from the affected device and have attached them to this email for your review.

It would be quite insightful to see if there is any information within these logs that might help us pinpoint the root cause of this recurring issue.

Kind regards,
Abhishek Kunwar

HI Andrei,

We converted the MSI into  Win32 EPPClientSetup.6.2.4.2.intunewin<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/intune.microsoft.com/?ref=AdminCenter__;!!HK5oVgSobt9mFQ!aRDegdFrl3hDRCrjF-kdxUVkrXmpfhQi5GEru-4Zz9caSbSUy8RBzQUy9vTegrWKi-R852PrHbh8gR0FE9o8c9H2Vwclr0cHOA$> - as this gave more autofill options than using  Line-of-business app and we more than 2000 devices and around only 60  devices had an impact. Anyway, thanks for the document you provided is useful for future .
- the below is the email send it to Netwrix on 25th Feb.

Hi support,


I hope you're doing well. I wanted to report an issue we've encountered since rolling out Endpoint Protector 6.2.4.200 to all our devices last Thursday. So far, around 50 users have reported experiencing very sluggish performance and black screens following the Windows updates. We attempted to resolve the issue by removing the KB that was pushed on Thursday, but the devices remained sluggish and practically unusable.



Interestingly, when I uninstalled the Endpoint Client on these affected devices, their performance returned to normal immediately. However, after reinstalling the Endpoint Client, the devices worked smoothly again. I'm really unsure what might have caused this issue, as it appears that all the affected devices had Windows updates installed on the same day we rolled out the Endpoint Client. In contrast, devices that were not affected seemed to have received the Windows update before Thursday.



I wanted to reach out to see if this is something you have witnessed in the past, or if you have any insight into what might be causing this issue.


Kind regards,
Abhishek Kunwar

We did not encountered a similar issue before.
Since it's working with manual installation, could this be an issue with the Intune setup? Where were other computers installed using intune without issue?

Hello Andrei,

Thank you for reaching out. The EPP client was distributed using Microsoft Intune. We have successfully resolved the issues by manually installing or reinstalling the EPP client. At the moment, I don't have any affected devices to capture logs, but I will certainly do so if the same issue is reported again. Have you encountered this issue before and any other companies reported to you?

Kind regards,

Hello,

How was the Epp client distributed?
Can you please confirm if the issue resolves by manually resinstalling the Epp client?
To further look into this, can you please take a set of logs from an affected computer following the steps below?

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/Support_Tool_V2.zip__;!!HK5oVgSobt9mFQ!cUtah9XSzhVKH9yA6IXrwqBub9U9iDwuU60qYUKJiakwWVo-_TcT5hN29vYPf3W8sqCOLrMiLTJ4R57nFMrztzdWukYfNPTkag$>
2. Unzip the sub-archive corresponding to the client computer's operating system.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Confirm the slowness issue is present.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards
