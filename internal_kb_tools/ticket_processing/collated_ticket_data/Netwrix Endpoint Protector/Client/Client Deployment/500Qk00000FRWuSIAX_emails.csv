Hey Paul,

To install with the add-ons leave them all selected and the file name should look like this: EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[a=192.168.0.0].msi
The attributes are missing which means that they will be installed. Also in the msiexec, remove the outlook_ext part.

Without add-ons unselect the add-ons you do not want and it should look like this: EPPClientSetup.6.2.3.1010_x86_64_[a=192.168.0.0,o=0,n=0].msi
The attributes o=0 and n=0 mean they are not installed.

Let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,

OK, thanks for your reply. We met on Wednesday, October 9 to understand how to create a client installation file with the Outlook add-on.

I think the way to create the file with the add-on changed in server v5.9.4.0, but I can't find my notes. Do you recall? I think I have to select all of the add-on choices if I do not want any add-ons.

Regards,
Paul Goyette

Hey Paul,

There is no update from my end unless you did not receive the last email with the answer to your question.
There is no way to have a report or a dashboard to view the status of the addon.
Besides that, I was waiting to hear back from you if you managed to deploy the add-on to the rest of the computers.

Hello Eduard,

Is there a way to put this ticket on hold? We have deployed the new EPP client, but an issue has arisen and we can’t test the mail add-on yet.

If there’s no option to put it on hold, then I am fine with closing this ticket and reopening it if we need to.
