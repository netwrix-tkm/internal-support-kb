I've to install DLP endpoint protector on Ubuntu versions 23 & 24, Could you provide scripts for the same?

Also One more concern, We've recently renamed our host-names in our organization and and they already have DLP agent, and we have to make the policies department wise again, but when I'm searching by new host-names, I am not getting while creating custom policy.

Could you please help me for the same.

Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-13T10:39:01.000Z"
