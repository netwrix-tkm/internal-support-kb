When the proxy is disabled, the newly installed client will communicate with the server.
We found 2 workarounds for this issue:
1. to install the client without the proxy enabled. and after it is installed, to enable it.
2. to remove from /etc/epp/options.ini the line for the proxy and also the ""cert.xxxxx..."" file from the same folder. The client could communicate with the server after that.","","","","005Qk000001nViEIAU","2025-01-27T08:50:15.000Z"
