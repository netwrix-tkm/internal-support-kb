Good day!
We have a customer that have deployed their RHEL 8.7 client 2.1.0.6 back in 2023 period. Back then their EPP Server was deployed at 5.8.0.0 (As of December 2023).

Throughout the years, we have done regular updates with the user's devices. As we understand, their RHEL's clients were not updated during the EPP Server's upgrades as they are still able to communicate with the server and update the policies.

However, as of our latest follow up with the user, we understand they have upgraded all their RHEL from 8.7 to RHEL 8.10 recently, but did not upgrade the RHEL agents.

We've just done a health check, under the connected Computers from the Device Manager, we see that the RHEL clients are now still online and licensed, but the OS shows as RHEL 8.7 instead of RHEL 8.10

We understand this is due to the RHEL 8.7 client 2.1.0.6 version installed on their RHEL devices. We want to know if this is just a cosmetic effect, or does it have any production impact, such as the modules not working as intended ?
If there is any production impact, may we know the best way moving forward to resolving the production impact ?

Thank you!
