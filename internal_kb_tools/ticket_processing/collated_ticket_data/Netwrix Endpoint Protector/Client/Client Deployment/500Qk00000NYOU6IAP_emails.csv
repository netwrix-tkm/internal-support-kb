Thank you for reaching out to us.
I received a test build from the dev team which should not allow the pop-up to appear.
You can download it the the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp22112024/EPPMac3.0.4.0017.Notarized.tar

Since this is just a test build, please install it only on few computers, and let us know if it fixes the matter.
The test build worked correctly and suppressed the notifications after enabling full disk access.
Please let us know the result after checking.

Hi Alin

Thanks for the quick turnaround on the test build.

My colleague Fergus (cc'd) has tested, and this version has suppressed the notification, with EPP functioning as expected.

Is there a timeline for this to be released to production for deployment?

Hello Alin,

 

Just checking in on this one - are you able to confirm if there a timeline for this to be released to production for deployment?

Hi Alin

 

Thanks for the quick turnaround on the test build.

 

My colleague Fergus (cc’d) has tested, and this version has suppressed the notification, with EPP functioning as expected.

 

Is there a timeline for this to be released to production for deployment?

 

Kind regards,

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out to us.
I received a test build from the dev team which should not allow the pop-up to appear.
You can download it the the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp22112024/EPPMac3.0.4.0017.Notarized.tar

Since this is just a test build, please install it only on few computers, and let us know if it fixes the matter.
The test build worked correctly and suppressed the notifications after enabling full disk access.
Please let us know the result after checking.

Best regards,
Alin Anca

Hello John,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440568. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440568
Ticket Subject: Bluetooth prompt
Ticket Details: Hello,

On the latest major version of macOS (15) we are getting a prompt for each user that logs in that Endpoint Protector would like to access 'Bluetooth'. This is not something I've seen on our previous version of macOS (13). We are in a MDM environment utilising Jamf Pro, but Apple don't appear to allow us to manage this with a PPPC profile. We can't see any further information on this in your Jamf deployment guide (<a href='https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm' target='_blank'>https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm</a<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm%3c/a>>).

Could I please clarify the impact if the user hits 'No' or 'Yes' to this message? Will the application function correctly?

Thanks

Thank you!

Hello John,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00440568. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00440568
Ticket Subject: Bluetooth prompt
Ticket Details: Hello,

On the latest major version of macOS (15) we are getting a prompt for each user that logs in that Endpoint Protector would like to access 'Bluetooth'. This is not something I've seen on our previous version of macOS (13). We are in a MDM environment utilising Jamf Pro, but Apple don't appear to allow us to manage this with a PPPC profile. We can't see any further information on this in your Jamf deployment guide (<a href='https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm' target='_blank'>https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm</a<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Install/Agent/JAMF/Overview.htm%3c/a>>).

Could I please clarify the impact if the user hits 'No' or 'Yes' to this message? Will the application function correctly?

Thanks

Thank you!

Alin Anca
Technical Support Engineer
