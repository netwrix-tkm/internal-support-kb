2025.03.17 Update:
""The status of this case is follow:
If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.
But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.
And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.""
