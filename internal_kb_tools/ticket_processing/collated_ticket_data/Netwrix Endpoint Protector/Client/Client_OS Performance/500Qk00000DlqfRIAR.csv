Prospect Wotton + Kearney is doing a POC of Endpoint Protector; server hosted by Netwrix; version 5.9.3.0. They ran into an issue where they cannot access EasyLock using the Master Password configured in the admin console (see screenshot attached).
The behaviour was observed on Windows, using the 6.2.2.1 EPP client and latest version of EasyLock.

Server URL: https://5dayext.hosted.endpointprotector.com
Server ID: ZD35BCVQ

Thank you,
