Customer name is PrivatBank.
They reported that on one MacOS 15 Darwin user is complaining about low internet speed.
Enable/Disable Intercept VPN traffic did not help with this issue.
I will attach logs and screenshots under this post, please look into it.
After EPP client was deleted, internet speed started to be fast.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-15T09:50:32.000Z"

These both are very old (90+ days). CoreWin scheduled a meeting with PrivatBank for Monday March 10th. Do you think there are other details that should be gathered during this meeting?

The update from our partner on this case is as follows:

2025.03.17 Update:
""The status of this case is follow:
If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.
But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.
And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.""
