Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:
If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.
But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.
And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.
Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:
From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.
Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.
But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.
So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.
In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.
They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.
They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.
We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.
So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.
If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS
Because these two cases are merged into one.


Best regards,

Hello,

Thank you.
Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.
We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.
And also asked your additional questions.
As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

  *   Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs)
  *   We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
  *   Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?


Kind regards

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Danylo,

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:

If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.

But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.

And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Danylo,

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Hello,

We will have a remote session with the customer and EPP dev team on Wednesday at 13:00 regarding the #429094 -  - Issues with Google meet.

I think we will also discuss there the issue with ""Internet speed decreased"" because these issues may be related.

We are planning to recreate the case and gather some log files during this meeting, so I could get back to you here with the additional information.

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:

If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.

But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.

And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the update.  I will wait on your next email with the new logs captured with Intercept VPN enabled and the answers to the questions from our Dev team.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Danylo,

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello Danylo,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:
If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.
But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.
And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000IMR8r:ref

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.
Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:
From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.
Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.
But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.
So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.
In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.
They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.
They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.
We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.
So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.
If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS
Because these two cases are merged into one.


Best regards,

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for the update.  I will wait on your next email with the new logs captured with Intercept VPN enabled and the answers to the questions from our Dev team.

Hello,

Thank you.
Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.
We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.
And also asked your additional questions.
As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

  *   Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs)
  *   We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
  *   Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?


Kind regards

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Danylo,

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello Danylo,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:

If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.

But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.

And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello,

Thank you for the update.

Hello Danylo,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:

If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.

But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.

And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Danylo,

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello Danylo,

Since this particular issue has resolution by activating the intercept vpn feature and since we can see that you re having an active troubleshooting with Emil Podar on the google meets ticket (00429094 ) , our RD is asking if this ticket along with the R&D escalation can be closed as it represents a problem for which we already have a solution, which is turn on Intercept VPN.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000IMR8r:ref

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:
If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.
But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.
And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000IMR8r:ref

Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.
Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:
From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.
Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.
But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.
So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.
In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.
They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.
They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.
We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.
So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.
If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS
Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.
Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.
We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.
And also asked your additional questions.
As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

  *   Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs)
  *   We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
  *   Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.

Hello Danylo,

Since this particular issue has resolution by activating the intercept vpn feature and since we can see that you re having an active troubleshooting with Emil Podar on the google meets ticket (00429094 ) , our RD is asking if this ticket along with the R&D escalation can be closed as it represents a problem for which we already have a solution, which is turn on Intercept VPN.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Danylo,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the escalated case related to the internet speed decrease on MAC OS.

Our internal team has identified this issue to originate from the Apple's side as being a bug, thus limiting our direct ability to address it. We recommend to the customer to enable the intercept VPN traffic in the meantime.

As of right now, our team is investigating this further and they are trying to find solutions to keep using the product with the intercept VPN enabled.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.

Thank you for your understanding and trust.

Hello,

The status of this case is follow:

If the Intercept VPN traffic is ON - customer have issues with Google Meet, that is why they disabled this option.

But, without the Intercept VPN traffic option, there is internet speed issue occurs on several computers.

And unfortunately, customer cannot enable Intercept VPN traffic there because of Google meet issue.
So, if we will fix the issue with Google meet (#429094) this issue should be fixed as well.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000IMR8r:ref
 


Hello,

After our explanation, customer agreed to they to gather a set of logs on Monday, but we think it would be the last one.

Also, we received a clarification regarding these two issues:

From the beginning of this case, almost all macOS users started to have issues with the Google meet when the Intercept VPN traffic ON.

Then customer figured out that if Intercept VPN traffic is disabled, the Google meet issue is solved.

But after they disabled Intercept VPN traffic, some users start complaining to the issues with Internet speed decreases.

So, on Monday customer will enable Intercept VPN traffic, and if the situation with the internet starts to be better than they will instantly check the Google Meet issue, and after that, they will collect the logs.

In this way, we will be able to investigate two cases at the same time using the one set of logs.

Hello,

We just received non-positive feedback from the customer.

They are kind of irritated because we're only asking them to gather log files, but they do not receive any interim results.

They have already sent us significant amounts of set of logs related to the Internet speed and Google meet issues, but the status still the same.

We are afraid that if it continues, we could lose a loyalty from this customer.

So, could you please give us some interim results related to this issue using the previous log files? Because we do not sure that the customer will be able to gather logs this time.

If there are no results right now, maybe we can try to change our approach specifically for this issue?

 

I think it also relates to this ticket #429094 - Issues with Google meet on macOS

Because these two cases are merged into one.

Hello,

Thank you.

Customer confirmed that Intercept VPN was disabled.

We kindly asked them to try to recreate this issue with Intercept VPN enabled.

And also asked your additional questions.

As I know, the customer is using Cisco VPN client, but last time they could not disable it for test, unfortunately.

Hi Danylo,

Thank you for your email.

Can you kindly confirm if Intercept VPN was enabled with this set of logs?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

	Can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
	We have noticed that the customer have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled?
	Did the customer test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome?

Hello Danylo,

Would it be possible to share a new set of logs where the issue is reproduced?
You can ask the customer to enable the debug mode for the EPP Client and collect the logs after the issue is reproduced.

Thank you,
Emil

My colleague Emil Podar will have a remote session with you tomorrow.  I will wait on the feedback after this remote session as I do agree that the slowness issue may be related to ""Issues with Google meet.""

Hello,

We will have a remote session with the customer and EPP dev team on Wednesday at 13:00 regarding the #429094 -  - Issues with Google meet.

I think we will also discuss there the issue with ""Internet speed decreased"" because these issues may be related.

We are planning to recreate the case and gather some log files during this meeting, so I could get back to you here with the additional information.

Dear Danylo,

I would like to give you an update on this case as we have received an update from our Engineering team with the following message.

We were not able to reach a conclusion from the logs submitted, can we please ask the customer to send us a new set of logs from EPP macOS client v3.0.4.1006 with Intercept VPN enabled?  It is important to have the Endpoint Protector network extension enabled and activated while the issue is reproducing and while the customer is collecting the EPP client logs.

Could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions from our developers, it is important for them to also have this information.  Please see below the questions previously submitted.

Hello,

I've just clarified from the customer, and they said that they deleted a several macOS client from user's PC because of the issue ""#00429094 Issues with Google meet on macOS.""
Currently, they are updating all clients, and later they will comeback to the problematic computers and will test this issue again with the latest or test EPP clients.
