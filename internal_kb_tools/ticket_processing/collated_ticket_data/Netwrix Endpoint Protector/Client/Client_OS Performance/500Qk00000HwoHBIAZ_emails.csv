Thank you for contacting the Netwrix Support support team.

At the moment Endpoint Protector does not have WSL as an exit point under the applications so currently it is not possible to enforce polices on this application.  A feature request can be made to our R&D team, we can submit a request to add this application as an exit point to Endpoint Protector and then relay our Product team's response back to you.


Kind regards
