Hi Adrian,
 

Can you please provide an update on this ticket.

 

We are also receiving tickets from users where the websites that were working till last week are being blocked by EPP.

After disabling EPP the website starts working fine.

I’m creating another ticket for the same, this is just an FYI as it is similar to this scenario.
Likewise, there are no block logs in the CAP portal.

Hi Adrian,

I have attached the new logs from the user’s system to the ticket and wanted to highlight two concerns from today’s session:


	If the user is not uploading on the website, why was EPP preventing him from accessing it.
	Additionally, why were there no logs being generated in the CAP report for it.

I saw your direct email, and would like to inform you that we are not allowed to reply to direct emails, but we have to keep the communication in the Support tickets for transparency, so whenever you reply to a ticket please do in in the same thread where we communicated before regarding that specific topic and by keeping the  techsupport@netwrix.com email address at Receiver.

Please let me know if the user would be available tomorrow from 3:30, 4:30 or 5:30 PM IST as this would be my first earliest timeslots available.

Hello Harshvardhan,

Thank you for opening a ticket regarding this behavior.
Please let me know what would be the user availability for a sync so that we can try to help.
Unfortunately as we do not have credentials for the website you mentioned ( it uses also SSO ) we will need to have a direct intervention.
