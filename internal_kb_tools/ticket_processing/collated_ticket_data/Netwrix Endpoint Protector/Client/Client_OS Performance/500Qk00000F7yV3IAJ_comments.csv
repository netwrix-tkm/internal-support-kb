@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan this is most probably a server issue. I also saw some 500 internal server errors in the logs, other than that, the EPP server does not recognize the cient certificates it sends to its clients.

Please do the following:


 1. Check if the config file is not corrupted: /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/apps/ratool/config/epp.yml (In the backend procedure you can find how this file should look;)

2. check if the customer is using a custom nginx config. (or a custom port? )

3. Check if any custom certificate is used.

!!! NOTE:  Changes to certificates usually require updates to the Nginx configuration file.
If the customer is using a custom port, these updates should be handled by the support team so as not to overwrite the custom Nginx config file.
3.1 Check if Increased Communication Security is enabled, and disable it. (Appliance -> Server Maintenance page, Increased Communication Security section.)
After the UI setting was disabled, please also check the epp.nginx.config and make sure the wsf entry looks like this:

--- CODE ---


  location ~ ^/wsf/(.+.php)$ {

        #if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        #       return 401;
        #}

        alias   /var/www/EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/$1;
        include fastcgi_epp_params;
    }

--- CODE ---

         
3.2 If the comunication isn't established:

3.3 Regenerate the Server Certificate Stack.

If comunication is established, and the customer uses a UI certificate, please advise him to upload the UI certificate again.
