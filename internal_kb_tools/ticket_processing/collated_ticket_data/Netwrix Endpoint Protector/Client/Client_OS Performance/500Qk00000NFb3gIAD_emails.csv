Thank you for the details!
Ubuntu 24.10 is an interim release, which is maintained for 9 months. We only support the LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Ubuntu, such as 24.04.
You can technically use our clients, but they won't be 100% compatible, and that's why it's not working correctly.
You try with the latest version as well which was released Ubuntu for 24.04:

Ticket Number: 00439714
Ticket Subject: When DPI is turned on in a Ubuntu linux environment, the cap policy does not apply
Ticket Details: Hello, I'm Seungwook, an Endpoint Protector engineer.

If DPI is enabled in linux ubuntu, the cap policy does not seem to apply.

I set policy exit points to web browser and set policy denylist to block defined content/email.

I disable dpi and block as expected when uploading a document containing an e-mail to Chrome

However, if I enabled dpi and upload a document containing an email to Chrome, I do not block it, unlike what I expected.

I don't know why the above phenomenon occurs.

Additionally, the environment in which the client is installed is hubuntu 24.10 and kernel version 6.11.0-19-generic

Thank you.

From Seungwook.

Thank you!
