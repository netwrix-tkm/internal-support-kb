@WaitingOnEngineer

I had a first analysis of the logs provided and I wasn't able to conclude what is the root cause of the issue. In the logs I do not find any errors related to secretservercloud.com. In fact, there are no errors after the first trace of it in the logs. If possible, I think we should get another set of logs with the latest production client (so the one in 5941). We have DPI related improvements every patch so there is a slight chance that the issue is fixed. To be honest, I am not really confident that a newer build will fix it, but we need to check and at the same time it is better to debug the issue on a more recent client. I did not mention yet, I was not able to reproduce this inhouse (I do not have credentials to login there). One more thing that we should check with the customer. I did a little of research related to ""secretservercloud.com"" and it doesn't seem like it is a destination where one could upload files. Can we ask the customer if they are indeed able to upload files there? If it is not possible, I do not see why they would not agree to whitelist it. To be honest, I think that the issue is not on our side (so we might not be able to fix it). If we collect new logs, we should get the extended DPI logs as well, maybe those will help.
