Hi Manpreet,

The greyed out bluetooth devices suggest they are either disconnected from the client machine or possibly blocked (as specific devices) from Device Control > device rights settings.
If any issue persists let me know your timezone and availability for a Zoom session.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Alin,

Is this Test build tested on some other customer of yours or this is the first time we would be testing this build?
Does this test build contain only the Bluetooth fix or it has some other fixes as well?

This test build is not an official build, hence our QA validation is not complete yet, and it should not be deployed to large groups. It was created specifically to fix this issue.
I provided it in case you'd like to test the fix on a test machine.
As discussed, the official fix is targeted for the next 5.9.4.0 epp release, and that will be the agent build to use in production.

Best Regards,
Alin
