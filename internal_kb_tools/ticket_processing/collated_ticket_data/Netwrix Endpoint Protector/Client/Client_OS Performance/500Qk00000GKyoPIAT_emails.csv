Hi Alin,

The issue we discussed was successfully resolved for my PC, but it only seems to work for that specific project. When I try a different project on my PC, the same issue reappears.

Is there a more permanent solution for this problem?

Thanks and regards,
Thisal

Hi Alin,

We are still experiencing this issue with the EPP client installed on our PC. Occasionally, it prevents Visual Studio from opening or running projects. I've attached a screenshot of the errors that appear when launching Visual Studio. Additionally, the device's performance has noticeably decreased.

Thanks & Regards,
Thisal.

Hi Alin,

We are still experiencing this issue with the EPP client installed on our PC. Occasionally, it prevents Visual Studio from opening or running projects. I've attached a screenshot of the errors that appear when launching Visual Studio. Additionally, the device's performance has noticeably decreased.

Thanks & Regards,
Thisal.

Hi Alin,

 

The issue we discussed was successfully resolved for my PC, but it only seems to work for that specific project. When I try a different project on my PC, the same issue reappears.

 

Is there a more permanent solution for this problem?

 

Thanks and regards,

Thisal

I wanted to mention that 13:00 UK time is 6:30 PM in Sri Lanka.
If possible, could we schedule it a bit earlier, before 11:00 AM UK time? That would be ideal for me.

Hi Alin,

 

I wanted to mention that 13:00 UK time is 6:30 PM in Sri Lanka. 

If possible, could we schedule it a bit earlier, before 11:00 AM UK time? That would be ideal for me.

 

Best regards,

Thisal.

Hi Alin,

 

The issue we discussed was successfully resolved for my PC, but it only seems to work for that specific project. When I try a different project on my PC, the same issue reappears.

 

Is there a more permanent solution for this problem?

 

Thanks and regards,

Thisal

Hi Alin,

 

We are still experiencing this issue with the EPP client installed on our PC. Occasionally, it prevents Visual Studio from opening or running projects. I've attached a screenshot of the errors that appear when launching Visual Studio. Additionally, the device's performance has noticeably decreased.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Thisal.
