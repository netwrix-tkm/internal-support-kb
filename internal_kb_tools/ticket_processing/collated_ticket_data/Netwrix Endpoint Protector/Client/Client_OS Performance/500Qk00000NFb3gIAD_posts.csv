If DPI is enabled in linux ubuntu, the cap policy does not seem to apply.

I set policy exit points to web browser and set policy denylist to block defined content/email.

I disable dpi and block as expected when uploading a document containing an e-mail to Chrome

However, if I enabled dpi and upload a document containing an email to Chrome, I do not block it, unlike what I expected.

I don't know why the above phenomenon occurs.

Additionally, the environment in which the client is installed is hubuntu 24.10 and kernel version 6.11.0-19-generic

Thank you.
