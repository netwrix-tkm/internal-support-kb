Can you please confirm the server version you are using?
As a first step, please disable Minifilter Driver in Device Control -> Global settings, and test again.

We're on 5.9.1.0 and deployed the latest available sensor this morning in
preparation of upgrading to 5.9.2.0

As for the Minifilter Driver, the tooltip says it is applicable for Windows
only so that is irrelevant to this issue as we're only experiencing the
problem on Macbooks.  I've already got a workaround in place by allowing
""Bluetooth Other"" devices in our Global Rights policy but the bigger
question is why did these devices suddenly stop working after upgrading the
sensor.  Was there a change in how the EPP Mac agent classifies Bluetooth
devices?

You are correct, minifilter driver is only for Windows.
Regarding what changed, in 5910 a Bluetooth device bug was found due to how the agent uses MacOS-specific Bluetooth APIs to detect the device type, and allowing Bluetooth other is a workaround until the fix is implemented.
The fix is considered for version 5.9.4.0 which is targeted for next month.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

That actually answers all my questions and should be sufficient enough to
convince management to leave Bluetooth Other enabled until a fix is in
place. If the fix doesn't make it into 5.9.4.0 will it be added in 5.9.5.0?
We'd prefer to not leave Bluetooth Other enabled for longer than necessary.

If it does not make 5.9.4.0 it will automatically fall back to 5.9.5.0, but so far there is no information either way. Ultimately this is up to the Product team and if it falls to 5.9.5.0, it will be updated as such and it will not be present in the release notes.
Please let me know if you have follow-up questions.
