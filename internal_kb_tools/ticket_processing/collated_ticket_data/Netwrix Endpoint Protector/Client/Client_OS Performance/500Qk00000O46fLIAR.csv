After imported the license from the cloud portal my all AWS workspaces has been disturbed and not working properly. For all all users profile has been created on a temporary mode and data has been disappearing.","","Client is stating that he's having an issue with his AWS appliance after importing the license.


Update 16/04/2025

Connected remote with the client to investigate the case.

They have reported that after adding the license to their EPP server, somehow their AWS machines that had EPP installed started misbehaving, meaning for example it would throw them errors such as the one from the screenshots where they were getting a pop up telling they couldn't sign in.

When EPP was not installed, they could get in without  a problem and no such errors were thrown.

They were on EPP 6.2.3.1 with EPP Server 5.9.4.0.

We installed the above version, restarted the machine and as soon as he got back in he got the same error message.

Checked first the CAP policies and removed the device/user from them but that didn't help.

Also, in the computer settings DPI and MTP scanning were first disabled but the same error happened. Same thing happened after enabling them(restarted again for MTP).
Made sure the Stealthy DPI was enabled too but that didn't seem to make any difference as the same thing happened continuously.

Finally we agreed to upgrade the EPP server to 5.9.4.1 and then try to install the EPP 6.2.4.2000 but first asked them to take a snapshot of the EPP appliance inside their VM.

Given that the snapshot had around 150 GB, asked to reschedule and agreed to try tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST.

UPDATE 22/04/2025

Connected remote with the client and they confirmed first that the snapshot was done.
After that we went on and upgraded the EPP server to 5.9.4.1 and then we installed the 6.2.4.2000 on one of the AWS instance machines.
We restarted afterwards and everything was working accordingly. They were logged in properly with their accounts and also the apps they were using were connected accordingly.

Client will install the EPP on a few other machines and test it out.","Asked for more details.
Waiting for a response.

UPDATE 16/04/2025

Rescheduled for tomorrow at 2:30 PM IST to upgrade the epp server and the epp client.

UPDATE 22/04/2025

Will sent a follow up note and wait for their response.","Issue solved after upgrading to 5.9.4.1. and 6.2.4.2000","Integration/Compatibility","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client/OS Performance","NONE","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","MeasureOne","Kunal Koshti","2025-04-15T07:27:11.000Z","2025-04-28T08:38:23.000Z"
