@WaitingOnEngineer

There is nothing that we can do/tell if that's all you have. We need logs with the scenario reproduced, or the steps to reproduce it. How did they discover that the policies were not working for 15 minutes? What scenarios were tried? Did they change anything in the server side settings or policies? I recognize the user, it is one of the admins. Last time I connected to them, they were complaining about something similar and they said they did not change anything. We discovered later that Intercept VPN traffic was not enabled and that was the reason they had issues, but they said they did not disable it for that machine. It might be something similar this time as well. If they want us to investigate, you could enable logs on the machine and tell them to collect them when the issues reproduces.

The attached logs were collected during the time when the issue was reproduced. Since it happens at random times, the user can not reproduce it at will, so the user had the logs enabled 24/7 in order to capture the logs.  
I will check if there were any changes made or if anything happened prior to the event. 

When they complained about this issue, they told me that they did the regular check for their policies and they discovered that nothing was blocked. 
As they told me, there were no changes made to the policies... but I will double check.

There are no logs attached to the case, except for two Screenshots (one with server settings and another one with the Notifier details)

Still investigating this one. Indeed, I saw in the logs that there was a time frame when there were some issues with our network extension. I am curios, probably the answer is no, is the user trying sometimes to disable the network extension? Or does the customer has often issues with the internet connection? Poor internet connection, or maybe internet dropping often? I see they have some Cisco products and GlobalProtect as well, still I suppose those are not interfering with our extension, or trying to stop it. Also, how often does the customer encounter the issue?

The issue happens at random times, it happened 2 times in a week, when they noticed, but it could happen for multiple times without the customers even knowing about it. 
Their internet connection is good, they never mentioned anything regarding the internet connection being dropped.
They suspected that probably the OS updates are causing this issue, as it was happening a few times after the OS update. But it also happened without making any changes or updates for the OS or other apps. 
I can ask for a new set of logs for when they will notice the issue happening again, maybe it will help.","005Qk000001nViHIAU","2024-12-18T12:09:10.000Z","2024-12-18T12:09:10.000Z","false","false"

if they encounter the issue again, yes, please ask them to get logs. We will try to see if the same pattern that was discovered in the first set of logs applies again.

@Emil-Ionut Podar I've managed to reproduce something similar (same error), but only if a tried to disable EPP's network extension from Login Items. In that case the extension did not work anymore until I allowed it back. Can you ask the customer if they had to allow our extension before EPP started to block/report transfers properly? Or maybe they have some mass deployment tools that check this and enable it automatically.

I've had some other urgent issues and I postponed investigation of this one, I will try to get back to it soon. In the meantime, can you please also ask the customer if by any chance they, or some software/tool that they are using could have made some changes at Login Items? I know you mentioned also that OS update part, might be that one as well. But I see it happened without any updates also.

@Emil-Ionut Podar while we are waiting for some answers from the customer, I have prepared a test build:

 \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_12_31EppMac_v3.0.4.0019

In this build I left some extra logs and also in case the EPP network extension gets disconnected while a connect is in progress, it will try to start again. This could only help if our extension gets disconnected by some app or tool. If by any chance something is happening in the Login Items (maybe the OS tries to disconnect it? or remove it from there?) the changes will not help too much. As mentioned I managed to reproduce something similar only in this scenario, when I disabled the extension form Login Items. 

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Krzysztof Staszalek please help us with a download link. Thanks!
