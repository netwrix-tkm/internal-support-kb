"500Qk00000Fs0C7IAJ","00421245","Support Ticket","EPP Agent does not apply any policies on machine","Hello team,
EPP stopped working on my machine for a limited period of time. The system did not apply any block policies during this period. The agent appeared ONLINE in the console. DPI was ON on the user, Intercept VPN Traffic was ON on the user.  This was not the first time this happened. Blocking started again after about 15 minutes since I discovered the system was allowing any transfer. This is a worrying behaviour as it shows clear inconsistencies in the behaviour of the tool, thus exposing us to potential security risks during these random downtimes of the agent on machines. You can find attached the screenshots and logs collected during the incident. Thank you,","","The network extension is automatically turned off at random times. The test build provided should keep the network extension enabled.","Waiting for the customer to install the new test agent and confirm if the network extension will be disabled again.
The customer installed the latest agent and the issue was not reproduced since then.
Waiting for the next meeting with the customers in order to  confirm if I can close the ticket.","resolved with clean install","","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client/OS Performance","","","156.2","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Crecan Andrei","2024-09-17T12:51:47.000Z","2025-02-20T18:43:58.000Z"
