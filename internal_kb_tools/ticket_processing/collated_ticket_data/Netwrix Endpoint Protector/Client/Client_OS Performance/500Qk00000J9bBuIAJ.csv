"500Qk00000J9bBuIAJ","00429051","Support Ticket","Endpoint Protector asks to use bluetooth in macOS","I am opening this ticket at the request of our Desktop Engineers.
Apparently starting with macOS 14 and macOS 15, the Endpoint Protector Client is asking to use Bluetooth (see screenshot). 
They wanted to know why it's requesting this and is there a way to stop this from happening? I didn't see anything in the documentation regarding it.

Thanks!
