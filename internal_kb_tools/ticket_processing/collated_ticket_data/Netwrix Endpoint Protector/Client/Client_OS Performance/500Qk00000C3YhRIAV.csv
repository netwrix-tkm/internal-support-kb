"500Qk00000C3YhRIAV","00412388","Support Ticket","EPP agent high system memory consumption from file tracing","Hello,
We have several Windows EPP agents consuming 1-50GB of RAM. Traced the issue to file tracing on D and F drive partitions hosting a very heavy read/write SCADA application. 
Didnâ€™t see a way to globally exclude D and F (non C drive) partitions from file tracing so I created global file extension tracing exclusions. This lowered the system memory on several hosts to 1-2GB, but that is still significantly higher than other Windows hosts in our environment. Other hosts with D and F drives hosting this SCADA application are still consuming significant system memory. The EPP server (and in turn our Splunk server) are also getting filled up with excessive logs from these 6 hosts. Ended up just disabling file tracing on these 6 hosts, but would like to troubleshoot this issue further via screenshare.","","","","file tracing was optimized","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client/OS Performance","","","119.6","Closed - Resolved","Alyeska Pipeline Service Company","Kirill Maurits","2024-06-20T02:47:09.000Z","2024-10-17T16:10:11.000Z"
