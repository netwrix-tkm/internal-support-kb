Hello Emil,

The system stopped working again twice today on my machine. The first stop happened 1 hour after I had a system update.

I would like to mention that during that hour I was constantly testing EPP monitoring/blocking on different channels when it just stopped working. After a restart it started working again. And after about 15 minutes it stopped working on my machine.

The server is online. All settings on my user/machine are unchanged.

Currently, it’s not applying any CAP policies on my user so I can send any sensitive data on any channel without any blocks.

Additional collected logs are attached.

Thank you,

Hello Emil,

Any update on this topic?
This morning, after a system update, the policies stopped working again on my machine.

Currently EPP is not blocking any information transfer on my Mac, similarly to when this was reported.

Hello Emil,

Please try to get an update on this as today the system stopped working 3 times on my machine from what I could detect. Each time starting to work again after a restart.

If this is affecting other machines as well, we are looking at a serious security gap as EPP is not fulfilling the DLP role.
