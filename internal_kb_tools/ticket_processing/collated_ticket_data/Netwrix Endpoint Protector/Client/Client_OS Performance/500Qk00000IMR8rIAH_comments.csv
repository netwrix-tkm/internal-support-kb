@WaitingOnEngineer

Since the issue is only reproducing on one machine, can the customer tell us if there is any particular setup on that machine? Any apps that could interfere with the EPP client? (such as AVs, VPNs) 
I saw they have some Cisco products installed, is the issue reproducing when CISCO is disabled/uninstalled? Did they test on multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox), or only Chrome? Please gather more info for us and new tests should be made with this build: 

\192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2024-builds2024_11_29EppMac_v3.0.4.1006

It is the RC for 5941 and contains some improvements related to DPI. 

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Krzysztof Staszalek can you please help us with a download link? Thanks

Hi Daniel, Andre,

Apologies for the confusion.

I initially added the Windows build instead of the Mac one by mistake.

Please use the following link to download the right Mac build:

Hello,

We will have a remote session with the customer and EPP dev team on Wednesday at 13:00 regarding the #429094 -  - Issues with Google meet.
I think we will also discuss there the issue with ""Internet speed decreased"" because these issues may be related.
We are planning to recreate the case and gather some log files during this meeting, so I could get back to you here with the additional information.

@WaitingOnEngineer

The internet speed decrease issue is an Apple bug and there is nothing that we can do about it. So the customer will have to enable Intercept VPN traffic. We will have to resume investigations and find solutions for the customer from intercept VPN enabled.

@WaitingOnEngineer

I don't have the details for the Google Meet case, I did not investigate it. So, there is nothing I can tell you about that one. This will have to be addressed on the corresponding thread.

Hi Marian,

I hope you are well. 

Currently, dev team is waiting for more info on the other item.

As the issue here is not related to the one mentioned on the other ticket, we should close this item and keep that one open until we have more info from the customer.

Thank you,
Cristi
