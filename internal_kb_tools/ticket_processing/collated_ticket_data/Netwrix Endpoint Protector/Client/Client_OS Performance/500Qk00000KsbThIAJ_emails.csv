As agreed during our Monday sync we would like to ask if its possible to have a check while having Stealthy DPI Enabled + making sure that analytic.emburse.com website is not added in Allowlist for DPI - with the latest test build that I've sent to Om on the other ticket.

Dear Harshvardhan,

Our intention was to see if any possible conflict is created between these apps that performs scans at the network level or act as VPN, proxies.
This suggestion was made in the interest of establishing which the next steps would be. Also, as suggested on the instacart.com ticket - is it possible to test with the client from 5941 since you already have this server version in place?

Hi Adrian,

I do not think that disabling any other application would be helpful as the website starts working when EPP is disabled.

 

For now, the URL works because it has been whitelisted as a temporary fix until we find a permanent solution for it.

Hello,

From log analysis it can be observed that only one single request is made to analytics.emburse.com and it is ignored. Can EPP Client be tested while the other software is disabled (Zscaler, crowdstrike, carbon black and global vpn)?

Hi Adrian,

Yes, this is in regards with analytics.emburse.com (The website wont load completely) and is accessible only after disabling EPP via suspension OTP.

I have attached two screenshots for the same PFA.
              1. Not loading with full functionality: EPP on.
              2. Loading with full functionality: EPP disabled.

If you have any further queries, lets connect on a quick call.

Hi Harshvardhan,

Can you please let us know also if this is regarding analytics.emburse.com? If yes - from your screenshot it seems that the website is accessbile.
Did you tried also without the CAP policy or without EPP client or an OTP so that you have the proof that this is happening due to the EPP.

HI Adrian,

Thanks for the update. We will check and update you.

@Pavan<mailto:pavan.yash@zs.com> / @Om<mailto:omprabhakar.bankar@zs.com> : Please check by whitelisting analytic.emburse.com first. If it does not work, then install the test build and try again.
