Please ensure you have the snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud) in place.

This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for allowing us to assist you today.

As discussed during the remote session, please try to install the EPP v6.2.4.2000 on a few other machines and see if the issue is sorted in the same way it was solved on the one that we tested out during the meeting.

Looking forward to your response.
