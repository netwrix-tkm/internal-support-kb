There aren't any block logs being generated in the CAP portal.
Collected the logs for the user, PFA to the ticket.
Just an FYI this is similar to the previous Ticket #431430 and we have the same queries for this issue.
1. Why did EPP start blocking this website all of a sudden.
2. Why are there no Content Aware Block Logs being displayed in the console.

Thanks and regards.
