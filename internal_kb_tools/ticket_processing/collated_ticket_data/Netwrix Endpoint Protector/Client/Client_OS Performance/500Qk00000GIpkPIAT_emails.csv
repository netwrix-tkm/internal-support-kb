Hi Eduard,

Sorry for the delayed response on my end.
We had received a similar issue with another user and there’s a quick fix that worked for him and need to check if the same fix would work for him too but would need a day or two to solidify that the issue doesn’t persist anymore.

If the issue still persists, we could then connect on Monday. Do let me know if this works for you.

Again, sorry for the inconvenience.
