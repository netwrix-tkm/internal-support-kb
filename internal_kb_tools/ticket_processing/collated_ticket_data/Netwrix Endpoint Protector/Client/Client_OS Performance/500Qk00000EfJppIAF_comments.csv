@WaitingOnEngineer we will investigate and try to fix this if we can reproduce the crash, most probably there's a rare race condition leading to the crash.

However, we can assure our customers that this doesn't affect the functionality because SSLsplit is automatically re-started in case it crashes or is killed by a user so normal functionality is restored.

@WaitingOnEngineer by doing intensive testing and review I found something that might cause a crash in SSLsplit due to thread safety issues: libevent is not always used in a thread-safe manner. I will make a fix for this issue and probably push to include it in the 5.9.4.1 release.
