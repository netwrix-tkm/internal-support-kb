"500Qk00000NFb3gIAD","00439714","Support Ticket","When DPI is turned on in a Ubuntu linux environment, the cap policy does not apply","Hello, I'm Seungwook, an Endpoint Protector engineer.

If DPI is enabled in linux ubuntu, the cap policy does not seem to apply.

I set policy exit points to web browser and set policy denylist to block defined content/email.

I disable dpi and block as expected when uploading a document containing an e-mail to Chrome

However, if I enabled dpi and upload a document containing an email to Chrome, I do not block it, unlike what I expected.

I don't know why the above phenomenon occurs.

Additionally, the environment in which the client is installed is hubuntu 24.10 and kernel version 6.11.0-19-generic

Thank you.

From Seungwook.","","- I let the customer know that we don't support temporary Ubuntu versions -24.10
