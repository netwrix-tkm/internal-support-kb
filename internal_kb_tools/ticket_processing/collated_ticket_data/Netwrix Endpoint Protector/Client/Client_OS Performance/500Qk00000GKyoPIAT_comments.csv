@WaitingOnEngineer 

The first question is: why this issue was not solved into remote connection live session or after just analysing the logs?


(in remote connection with live logs, just most to see which process crashes, “WerFault.exe” is called and just must to add a new process into detour allowlist, NOT WerFault.exe)


The second question is: how/why these processes were added?
run.exe
cmd
wmic.exe
*infor*
rundll32.exe
SearchIndexer.exe


I am wondering how these processes were selected to be whitelisted?


In the received logs I searched for the followings:

- search after: “C:WINDOWSsystem32WerFault.exe -pss -s” (155 de found was made). You can iterate through all the 155 items (maximum 10 minutes and you can add all the found processes in detour list)

- search after “C:WINDOWSSysWOW64WerFault.exe -pss -s” (98 founds)

Example 1:
10-01 10:59:09.996 25448 INFO   proc cmd: ‘C:WINDOWSsystem32WerFault.exe -pss -s 728 -p 6620 -ip 6620’ [cf::ProcessMonitor::processCreated ProcessMonitor.cpp:172]
-> please see what process has process id = 6620

In logs is a little bit above:
10-01 10:59:09.917 25448 DEBUG  process created: 6620/15636, 
‘UserAwarenessHelper.exe’, image: 
‘C:WindowsSystem32DriverStoreFileRepositoryicss_extension.inf_amd64_e2b0f9b638a5f3bfUserAwarenessHelper.exe’
 packageName: ‘’ total: 343 replaced: no 
[cf::ProcessMonitor::processCreated ProcessMonitor.cpp:167]

=> this means we should add “UserAwarenessHelper.exe” process


Example 2:
10-01 11:08:42.596 25448 INFO   proc cmd: ‘C:WINDOWSSysWOW64WerFault.exe -pss -s 640 -p 25140 -ip 25140’ [cf::ProcessMonitor::processCreated ProcessMonitor.cpp:172]

please see what process has process id = 6620

In logs is a little bit above:
10-01 11:08:42.494 25448 DEBUG  process created: 25140/17308, 'GVClient.Classifier.Windows.exe', image: 'C:Program Files (x86)GVClientapp-4.1.5GVClient.Classifier.Windows.exe' packageName: '' total: 492 replaced: no [cf::ProcessMonitor::processCreated ProcessMonitor.cpp:167]

=> this means we should add “GVClient.Classifier.Windows.exe” process

The whitelisted processes should be the followings:

	 - 	GVClient.Classifier.Windows.exe
	 - 	WinStudio.exe
	 - 	OSProfileCollector.exe
	 - 	UserAwarenessHelper.exe

@WaitingOnEngineer
From the received logs I extracted the processes which crashes, for the mentioned app should work as expected.

I explained how you can extract the processes (please connect remote to the customer and extract the processes and be aware all of them will be added @Alin Anca).
