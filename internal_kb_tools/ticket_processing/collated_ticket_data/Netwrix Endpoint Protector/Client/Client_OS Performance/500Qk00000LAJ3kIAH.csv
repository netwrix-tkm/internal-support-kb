We have an ongoing issue when a user tries to print an email from the Microsoft Outlook app, they get a dlp block pop-up saying ""The Print action was blocked for: Microsoft Outlook - Memo Style"". I will attach the screenshot for proof as well

Now that we don't have any policies in place where we block such type of printing.

We extracted the logs for this, and I am attaching them to this ticket for review. To see the error, I would point you to the exact line in the log, which is line 2509. This will narrow down the time to review the logs.

We are facing a time-sensitive issue, and we would appreciate it if you could help us instantly.

Thanks,
Parin","","The Outlook printing is blocked by a CAP Policy that the customer cannot find in the Policies list.

We had a remote session in which we checked the CAP logs and CAP Policies and gathered the necessary information to escalate this ticket to R&D.

The R&D team has proposed a newer epp client build to test with, and we have sent it to the customer.

In the meantime, the customer has upgraded their server to 5.9.4.1 and they will test with the latest eppclient version.

We are closing this ticket as the customer hasn't replied yet.","We have scheduled a remote session for Thursday 10:00 -11:00 AM MST time to investigate the issue.

An escalation ticket has been raised and we are waiting for a resolution from R&D.

We are waiting for the customer's feedback after testing the new epp client build provided by R&D

The customer is testing if the latest eppclient version from 5.9.4.1 will solve their issue starting next week.","The issue was resolved after upgrading to the 5.9.4.1 server version and 6.2.4.2 epp client.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Client","Client/OS Performance","","","72.1","Closed - Resolved","Canada Guaranty","Parinkumar Patel","2025-01-28T15:19:18.000Z","2025-04-10T17:58:22.000Z"
