Hi Eduard,
I added the D & F paths to the allowlists file locations. Probably could've just made one, but I added them individually and applied to appropriate systems.
I will re-enable file tracing on those systems and report back.

Thanks

Eduard,
After making the D & F allowlist changes yesterday and re-enabling file tracing, the EPP system memory consumption is ~4.2GB on each of these hosts.

The D & F allowlist was in addition to the file extension exclusions below.

[cid:image002.png@01DAC3CC.019B7180]

Please let me know what else can be done to lower EPP memory usage on these hosts besides permanently disabling file tracing. Disabling file tracing and restating the EPP service on these hosts seems to keep memory under ~200MB.

Thanks

Another thing that might help is modifying the trace direction. Depending on your use case, setting it just for outgoing will not check files copied to the computer but will trace files going out of the network.
Also maybe removing file tracing for Network shares as that should be the heaviest user, so as before, if you do not really need to trace files on the network since they are not leaving your company, that might also be an option.
Let me know if these two are an option.
I will also ask engineering and my colleagues on Monday for other settings that might help.

We do have internal network shares we monitor for file tracing so the preference would be to leave that on.
These 6 hosts are the only ones that are giving us tracing/memory issues by writing millions of files locally between the D and F drives.
Looks like EPP thinks these are removable drives because we don't have this issue on other systems running the same software on only the C drive.
These 6 hosts are unique where the heavy read/write SCADA application was installed on the D drive with archive on the F drive.

I'll try enabling outgoing only for these 6 host and report back.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Kirill,

Another thing that might help is modifying the trace direction. Depending on your use case, setting it just for outgoing will not check files copied to the computer but will trace files going out of the network.
Also maybe removing file tracing for Network shares as that should be the heaviest user, so as before, if you do not really need to trace files on the network since they are not leaving your company, that might also be an option.
Let me know if these two are an option.
I will also ask engineering and my colleagues on Monday for other settings that might help.

Thank you,

Eduard,

After making the D & F allowlist changes yesterday and re-enabling file tracing, the EPP system memory consumption is ~4.2GB on each of these hosts.

 

The D & F allowlist was in addition to the file extension exclusions below.  

 



 

Please let me know what else can be done to lower EPP memory usage on these hosts besides permanently disabling file tracing. Disabling file tracing and restating the EPP service on these hosts seems to keep memory under ~200MB.

 


Thanks

Hi Eduard,

I added the D & F paths to the allowlists file locations. Probably could’ve just made one, but I added them individually and applied to appropriate systems.

I will re-enable file tracing on those systems and report back.

 

Thanks

Hi Kirill,

In order to whitelist D: and F:, please go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlist, and in the File location tab, create a new list, and add the path, you can go as particular as you want, and then select the computers you wish the allowlist to apply to.
Save and it should not file trace on those locations.
If you see that it is still tracing, let me know as we will need to troubleshoot.

Hi Eduard,
I initially added the allowlist file location paths as D:xxxxxxx, but looking at the EPP logs the file writes were getting logged as D:/xxxxxxxx.
I added both D & F path types and this lowered the system memory usage to under 40MB per host. Has not spiked all weekend.

I'm still getting a low disk space alert on the EPP appliance from when these hosts were logging/tracing millions of files. I do have monthly audit log backups enabled, but should we just manually delete everything to save on appliance and DB storage?

I also saw there are newer versions 5.9.2.0 and 5.9.3.0 available. We are on 5.9.1.0.

We do have internal network shares we monitor for file tracing so the preference would be to leave that on.
These 6 hosts are the only ones that are giving us tracing/memory issues by writing millions of files locally between the D and F drives.
Looks like EPP thinks these are removable drives because we don't have this issue on other systems running the same software on only the C drive.
These 6 hosts are unique where the heavy read/write SCADA application was installed on the D drive with archive on the F drive.

I'll try enabling outgoing only for these 6 host and report back.

Thanks for your help.

I would not want to go straight to deleting logs, we can set up a remote session and I can take a look in the backend and try to reduce the disk space as much as I can, and then we can manually run an audit log. For this, please make sure we have SSH access to the server.

Hey Kirill,

I would not want to go straight to deleting logs, we can set up a remote session and I can take a look in the backend and try to reduce the disk space as much as I can, and then we can manually run an audit log. For this, please make sure we have SSH access to the server.
Let me know your timezone and availability in the next couple of days and I will set it up.

Thank you,

Hi Eduard,
I initially added the allowlist file location paths as D:xxxxxxx, but looking at the EPP logs the file writes were getting logged as D:/xxxxxxxx.
I added both D & F path types and this lowered the system memory usage to under 40MB per host. Has not spiked all weekend.

I'm still getting a low disk space alert on the EPP appliance from when these hosts were logging/tracing millions of files. I do have monthly audit log backups enabled, but should we just manually delete everything to save on appliance and DB storage?

I also saw there are newer versions 5.9.2.0 and 5.9.3.0 available. We are on 5.9.1.0.

We do have internal network shares we monitor for file tracing so the preference would be to leave that on.
These 6 hosts are the only ones that are giving us tracing/memory issues by writing millions of files locally between the D and F drives.
Looks like EPP thinks these are removable drives because we don't have this issue on other systems running the same software on only the C drive.
These 6 hosts are unique where the heavy read/write SCADA application was installed on the D drive with archive on the F drive.

I'll try enabling outgoing only for these 6 host and report back.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Kirill,

Another thing that might help is modifying the trace direction. Depending on your use case, setting it just for outgoing will not check files copied to the computer but will trace files going out of the network.
Also maybe removing file tracing for Network shares as that should be the heaviest user, so as before, if you do not really need to trace files on the network since they are not leaving your company, that might also be an option.
Let me know if these two are an option.
I will also ask engineering and my colleagues on Monday for other settings that might help.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C3YhR:ref

Eduard,
After making the D & F allowlist changes yesterday and re-enabling file tracing, the EPP system memory consumption is ~4.2GB on each of these hosts.

The D & F allowlist was in addition to the file extension exclusions below.

[cid:image002.png@01DAC724.D8C35140]

Please let me know what else can be done to lower EPP memory usage on these hosts besides permanently disabling file tracing. Disabling file tracing and restating the EPP service on these hosts seems to keep memory under ~200MB.

Thanks

Hi Eduard,
I added the D & F paths to the allowlists file locations. Probably could've just made one, but I added them individually and applied to appropriate systems.
I will re-enable file tracing on those systems and report back.

Hi Kirill,

In order to whitelist D: and F:, please go to Denylist and Allowlist -> Allowlist, and in the File location tab, create a new list, and add the path, you can go as particular as you want, and then select the computers you wish the allowlist to apply to.
Save and it should not file trace on those locations.
If you see that it is still tracing, let me know as we will need to troubleshoot.
