@WaitingOnEngineerÂ From log analysis it can be observed that only one single request is made to analytics.emburse.com and is ignored. Can EPP Client be tested while the other software is disabled (Zscaler, crowdstrike, carbon black and global vpn)? While doing this test, please upload the new logs so we could analyze them, thanks.
