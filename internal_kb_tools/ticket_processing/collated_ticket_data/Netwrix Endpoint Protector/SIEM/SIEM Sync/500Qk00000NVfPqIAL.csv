I am using splunk sc4s to recieve syslog from epp to our splunk, however once i turn on the encryption the logs stop flowing. I have confirmed with splunk that everything on their side is working as expected, so I would like to check the epp side. I would like to have a session where we get into the our epp server and check the tls configuration on it, as it seems that the problem lies there.","","Customer encounter an issue with the SIEM, that once the TLS is enabled logs stop flowing.","We will schedule a remote session with them to check if the communication is working and if the logs are being sent.

In the session we have shown to the customer that the data is being shared from our end.
