I sync my EPP server with a SIEM collector, but I can't see logs on the other side. I Don't find any way to troubleshoot or further test if the SIEM is working. Also, as the server was created on a onpremise server in Azure, we are missing credentials to access the ubuntu via SSH.","","the customer does not receive any logs in the SIEM server, and I think it is due to the fact that we send in the syslog-ng format and they are waiting for the rsyslog format.
I asked the customer to configure the SIEM server for syslog-ng and to let me know the outcome","waiting for the customer","guide and information provided","","Eduard Nut","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","28.1","Closed - Resolved","Callzilla","Daniel Florez","2025-01-22T18:25:47.000Z","2025-02-19T20:39:12.000Z"
