Customer name is PrivatBank.
After the EPP server migration with System backup v2 the logs from EPP stopped sending to their SIEM system.
The integration setting still the same, but logs are not going there.
Could you please help to investigate?
Perhaps you would need to connect to the EPP backend via ssh.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-24T13:35:11.000Z"
