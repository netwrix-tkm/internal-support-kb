Hi @Cătălin Stoian, @Bogdan Melinte,

Could you please have a look at the above issue?
Augustina mentioned that this is something devops should look into.

Thank you,

Hi Andre,

I can see from the attached screenshots that they are using UDP for the communication, so the tcpdump command would need to be adjusted to capture the UDP traffic. Based on the reply from here: https://askubuntu.com/a/913417 we would need the following command:


--- CODE ---
tcpdump -n udp port 1516
--- CODE ---

Also could you please also make a screenshot of the actual config file locate under `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/*` would have a number attached to it based on the actual entry in the SIEM list.

Also could you please issue the following command `systemctl restart syslog-ng` and capture from the `/var/eppfiles/syslog` file when the service restart the connection parameters. They will show as an error if there is an issue. 

Also we could potentially verify if the udp port is actually open on the other side by using the netcat utility, but this would potentially need to be installed as we do not have it by default on the instance (https://serverfault.com/a/263034).

Please see the output by the screenshots uploaded to the attachments folder.

I ran  `systemctl restart syslog-ng` but received the following error

""Job for syslog-ng.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See ""systemctl status syslog-ng.service"" and ""journalctl -xe"" for details.""


The directory ""/var/eppfiles/syslog"" does not exist.


I could not action the below, could you please advise on how t proceed?

Andre, could you please take a quick look at what the error when starting syslog-ng is and also potentially test the configs with

`
syslog-ng -s` - this will check for syntax errors
`
syslog-ng --check-startup` - this will check the initialization (might not be available depending on the syslog-ng version)
