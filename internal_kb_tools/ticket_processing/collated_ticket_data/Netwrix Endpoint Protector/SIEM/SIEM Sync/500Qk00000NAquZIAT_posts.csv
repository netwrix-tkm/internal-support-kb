Customer name is PrivatBank.
Their SOC team is asking if it is possible to transfer EPP logs to SIEM with changed event's file name?
The reason it is needed is that customer configured the S3 Bucket for shadow copies.
And after the shadow copy sent to this Bucket, it names changes with a hash added (as we understand) 
for example: <a href='https://sFile-20c7d3fc9b20f77f57426795ccfb24fb-BRAK_GALYA_20210629.xlsx' target='_blank'>sFile-20c7d3fc9b20f77f57426795ccfb24fb-BRAK_GALYA_20210629.xlsx</a>
But in the log that goes to the SIEM, this file name is called like default, and because of this, it can be difficult to correlate the shadow copy with the event.
So, the question is would it be possible to send the edited log with the new shadow copy name to the SIEM (with hash) to make is easily to correlate the log with the saved shadow copy stored in the S3 Bucket?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-21T11:21:43.000Z"
