Thank you for reaching out!

The settings that you are making are from the EPP or from Splunk ? 

Once enabled you are not receiving any logs ?

We can schedule a remote session tomorrow at 13:00 Israel time. 

If the time frame does not suit you, please provide us your availability. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi,
sorry for not answering, we had a very busy few days
Yes, once TLS is enabled logs stop flowing. I have checked the validity of the configurations on my side together with splunk support, and one theory that we have is that epp tries to use tls 1.1,which we don't support.

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have verified the syslog logs that they are being sent from our end to yours and they are being blocked by the SIEM server. 

We have also checked and agreed that the encrypted files were sent and received by your end. 

Since the issue is now solved, we will proceed with the closure of this case. 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
