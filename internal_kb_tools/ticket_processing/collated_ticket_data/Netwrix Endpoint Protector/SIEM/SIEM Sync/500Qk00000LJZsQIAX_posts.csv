CIANDT always used splunk and is now migrating to secops, they did all the process to sync but no log is getting there. Do you know if the EPP sends to one and the logs cannot be fowarded to the other? I can show the configuration too so we can discuss before asking for a meeting.

Best regards,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-31T15:17:20.000Z"
