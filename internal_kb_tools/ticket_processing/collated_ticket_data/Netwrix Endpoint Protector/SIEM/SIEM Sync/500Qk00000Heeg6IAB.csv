"500Qk00000Heeg6IAB","00425459","Support Ticket","IP Public for SIEM Integration","Hi Support Team, 

I would like to inquire about the Public IP list used by Endpoint Protector for SIEM Integration, we need to know the Public IP list for Whitelisting on the customer side. currently we found 2 Public IPs used by Netwrix Endpoint Protector for SIEM integration, they are 

- 108.137.105.248
- 198.199.98.246.

from the IP list, are there any other IPs that need to be whitelisted so that this SIEM Integration runs smoothly? because previously we only whitelisted 1 IP, 108.137.105.248 but we found other IPs that need to be whitelisted as well, please advise.

Regards,
