"500Qk00000PEdsjIAD","00445366","Support Ticket","SIEM format | CEF - JSON (RoofStacks)","Hello Team,

Our customer would like to know if it's possible to send SIEM logs in JSON format instead of CEF. Is that something we support?

I was previously informed that this could be done using Unify. I also heard that Unify will support API integration, and that this feature is on the roadmap for Q1.

Could you also share some information about Endpoint Protector Unify? I couldn’t find any resources about it on the website. What exactly is Unify, what capabilities does it offer, and how can we make use of it? I’d really appreciate the details.

Best Regards.","","16 May

- Currently, Netwrix Endpoint Protector only supports SIEM log integration in syslog format; JSON output is not available at this time.
- There is no current support for sending SIEM logs in JSON format directly from Endpoint Protector.
- The product roadmap includes plans for future enhancements, such as API integration, which may expand log format options.
- Information about Endpoint Protector Unify is limited and not readily available on the public website.
- The support team has offered links to the product roadmap and the Netwrix Ideas Portal for submitting and tracking feature requests.
- A colleague with more expertise on Unify has been looped in to provide further details.","16 May
