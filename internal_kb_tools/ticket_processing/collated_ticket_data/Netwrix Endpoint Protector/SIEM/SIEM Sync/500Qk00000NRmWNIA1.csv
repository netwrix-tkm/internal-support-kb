Our Endpoint Protector (EPP) instance does not appear to be sending any logs to our SIEM (Sumo Logic). Despite having active alerts within EPP, no corresponding log entries are visible in the SIEM for the past 30 days.

Details:

- The SIEM integration feature is enabled in our EPP configuration.
- The Server IP and Security Token values in the EPP SIEM configuration exactly match those configured in our Sumo Logic collector.
- Despite this, we are not receiving any logs or events from EPP in our SIEM environment.
- There is at least one alert currently present in the EPP system, which should have triggered log generation and transmission to the SIEM, but no such activity is visible in the logs.","","Their SIEM integration does not work, and the customer states that it was set correctly.","waiting for initial answers","the customer needs to review their syslog settings.","","Eduard Nut","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","18.2","Closed - Resolved","Socure","Shaun Khublall","2025-03-28T16:50:45.000Z","2025-04-15T20:29:31.000Z"
