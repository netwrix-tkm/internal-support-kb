Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan and Botond,

The issue lies here:

""They created an Inbound + Outbound rule to allow the connection from the EPP server, however when I tried to telnet to the VMs IP, it didn't work.""

If the telnet was tried from the backend of the EPP machine and it didn't work, then they need to first fix this network issue on their side.

As for Rapid7 SIEM compatibility with the EPP Server, that I cannot ascertain. If our support team has tested this, they can confirm/infirm its compatibility. In my view, however, it most probably is compatible with EPP Server.
