We're no longer receiving any logs from this system. I've worked with our firewall admins and have validated that we're not seeing any traffic between the Endpoint Protector server and the destination syslog server.

I'm looking for some assistance troubleshooting from the Endpoint Protector side of things to ensure we're not having a problem there. I was hoping for some guidance with reviewing logs to see if there's any errors that are occurring with this function.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-22T19:54:47.000Z"
