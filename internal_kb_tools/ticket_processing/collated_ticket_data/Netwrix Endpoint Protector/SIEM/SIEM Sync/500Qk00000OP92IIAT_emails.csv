Hello!

Yes, you are correct.
The new server has the same IP address as the previous server.
Also, the SIEM integration settings were not changed, it is the same due to the System Backup v2 option has been used.

I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.
You can also join via the following link:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/85722112308?pwd=bJaxOIlthOGfdX5xqQcC3pvZemE3wD.1

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.
 
Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.
 
Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:
 
-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Danylo,

I could do a few checks from the backend in that case.
Should we schedule a remote session for this?

Hello!

Yes, you are correct.

The new server has the same IP address as the previous server.

Also, the SIEM integration settings were not changed, it is the same due to the System Backup v2 option has been used.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!

Just to confirm, the logs from the new server aren't getting to the SIEM server?
Does the new server have a different IP address? If yes, it might need to be whitelisted on the SIEM server.
Please send me a screenshot of how the SIEM is configured on the EPP server.

Hi Danylo,

I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.
You can also join via the following link:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/85722112308?pwd=bJaxOIlthOGfdX5xqQcC3pvZemE3wD.1

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom

Hi Danylo,

I could do a few checks from the backend in that case.
Should we schedule a remote session for this?

Hi Danylo,

I scheduled the remote session and sent you an invite.
You can also join via the following link:
https://netwrix.zoom.us/j/85722112308?pwd=bJaxOIlthOGfdX5xqQcC3pvZemE3wD.1

As during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualization environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a  snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty
-Zoom
