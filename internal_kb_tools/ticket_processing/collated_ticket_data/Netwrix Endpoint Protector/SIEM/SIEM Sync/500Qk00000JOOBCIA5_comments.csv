Hi,

Was the Encryption enabled all the time?

How many SIEM servers are configured?

Try to do the following:

	 - 	restart the syslogng service

	 - 	systemctl restart syslog-ng
	 - 	ping IP
	 - 	check the expose certificate:

	 - 	openssl s_client -showcerts -connet ip:port

	 - 	//replace the IP and port with specific ones
	 - 	check if there are any connection errors

	 - 	tail -f /var/log/syslogÂ 



Navigate to the directory /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/ and review the SIEM configuration files. There may be one or more files, depending on the number of SIEM servers configured in EPP (e.g., 1-siem.conf, 2-siem.conf, etc.). Open the files, and share a screenshot of the configuration.



Delete the SIEM configuration and try to recreate it, importing the certificate again. (ask the customer to regenerate the certificate again).


After this step, please provide again a printscreen with the config file (from /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/ directory)


Regards,
Augustina

Small update, the customer found out that the TLS listener that pulls in the logs is using TLS 1.2, and they were thinking it could be an issue if the logs started being sent using 1.3. I suggested to modify the listener to pull in the logs using TLS 1.3, but that didn't help.
Thanks,
