"500Qk00000NAquZIAT","00439607","Support Ticket","Possibility to transfer EPP logs to SIEM with changed event's file name","Hello!

Customer name is PrivatBank.
Their SOC team is asking if it is possible to transfer EPP logs to SIEM with changed event's file name?
The reason it is needed is that customer configured the S3 Bucket for shadow copies.
And after the shadow copy sent to this Bucket, it names changes with a hash added (as we understand) 
for example: <a href='https://sFile-20c7d3fc9b20f77f57426795ccfb24fb-BRAK_GALYA_20210629.xlsx' target='_blank'>sFile-20c7d3fc9b20f77f57426795ccfb24fb-BRAK_GALYA_20210629.xlsx</a>
But in the log that goes to the SIEM, this file name is called like default, and because of this, it can be difficult to correlate the shadow copy with the event.
So, the question is would it be possible to send the edited log with the new shadow copy name to the SIEM (with hash) to make is easily to correlate the log with the saved shadow copy stored in the S3 Bucket?","","- customer wants to know if renamed files can be sent to SIEM
- we're not sure if they get renamed on the computers or on their S3 bucket","waiting for more information","the customer confirmed we can close the ticket because they will try to match file names by Hash field from the SIEM.","","Botond Biro","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","3.1","Closed - Resolved","Privat Bank","CoreWin Tech","2025-03-21T11:21:43.000Z","2025-03-24T14:39:08.000Z"
