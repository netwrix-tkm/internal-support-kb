Hello Zach,

They checked their GCP and saw that no rule is applied to block anything
through the port used. They even tested directly to their SIEM and were
able to see the testlog getting there:
[image: image (5).png]
But for some reason the EPP logs do not get there. Do you have any idea
what should be our next step to find out the problem?

Best regards,

Can you please provide me with availability for a remote session? I would like to view if the eppserver can telnet to their SIEM tool as well as take a look at their syslog config file on the server to make sure that the UI settings made it to the config file.

Thank you,

Hello Lucas,

It is ok, someone did let me in and they were able to get someone that could translate on the call. They believed that EPP has a firewall that is blocking their SIEM tool connection from their GCP instance and that is not the case. I told them that there are no blocked outbound connections from EPP and that any blocks would come from the GCP firewall. They are going back to check on their rules and will report their findings after.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hello Lucas, 

Can you please provide me with availability for a remote session? I would like to view if the eppserver can telnet to their SIEM tool as well as take a look at their syslog config file on the server to make sure that the UI settings made it to the config file.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hello Zach,
 

They checked their GCP and saw that no rule is applied to block anything through the port used. They even tested directly to their SIEM and were able to see the testlog getting there:


But for some reason the EPP logs do not get there. Do you have any idea what should be our next step to find out the problem?

Hello Lucas,

It is ok, someone did let me in and they were able to get someone that could translate on the call. They believed that EPP has a firewall that is blocking their SIEM tool connection from their GCP instance and that is not the case. I told them that there are no blocked outbound connections from EPP and that any blocks would come from the GCP firewall. They are going back to check on their rules and will report their findings after.

Thank you,

Hello Zachary,

The OS is a Ubuntu 22.04 and the version came out 5.8.1.0 and was updated
to the newest to make the migration.
Thats the info on the new one.
The old one was a 18.04 and was probably using the 5.6.0.0 version.

I don't know how available they are, but do you think we could have a call Tuesday so I can run some commands on the backend? Since the originating system started on 5.6 then that most likely is the reason for the SIEM not working and I just need to run some commands to get it enabled as well as clean up what we were attempting last time.

If not, we can schedule something for after Thanksgiving.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hello Zachary,
 

The OS is a Ubuntu 22.04 and the version came out 5.8.1.0 and was updated to the newest to make the migration.

Thats the info on the new one.

The old one was a 18.04 and was probably using the 5.6.0.0 version.

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Can you tell me what OS image and EPP version the original server was built on when first installed? Depending on the answer I might have some things to try.

Thank you,

Hello Lucas, 

Can you please provide me with availability for a remote session? I would like to view if the eppserver can telnet to their SIEM tool as well as take a look at their syslog config file on the server to make sure that the UI settings made it to the config file.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hello Zach,
 

They checked their GCP and saw that no rule is applied to block anything through the port used. They even tested directly to their SIEM and were able to see the testlog getting there:


But for some reason the EPP logs do not get there. Do you have any idea what should be our next step to find out the problem?

 

Best regards,

Hello Lucas,

Do we know if they were able to find anything in their firewall rules when they went back to look again?

Hello Lucas,

It is ok, someone did let me in and they were able to get someone that could translate on the call. They believed that EPP has a firewall that is blocking their SIEM tool connection from their GCP instance and that is not the case. I told them that there are no blocked outbound connections from EPP and that any blocks would come from the GCP firewall. They are going back to check on their rules and will report their findings after.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy
