This can be achieved under the Appliance > SIEM menu.
The integration with SIEM technology enables Endpoint Protector to transfer activity events to a SIEM server for analysis and reporting.

In this section, you can add, edit or delete an existing SIEM Server integration. To edit or delete a SIEM Server you need to select an available SIEM server integration.

CAUTION: You can conﬁgure a maximum number of 4 SIEM Server integrations.



 

To create a SIEM Server, click Add New and provide the following information:


	
	SIEM Status – toggle switch to enable/disable the SIEM server
	
	
	Disable Logging – toggle switch to enable/disable logging

	NOTE: If you disable logging, logs will be stored on the Endpoint Protector server or on the SIEM server when SIEM is installed.
	
	
	Server Name – add a server name
	
	
	Server Description – add a description
	
	
	Server IP or DNS – add the IP or DNS
	
	
	Server Protocol – select the UDP or TCP server protocol

	NOTE: Based on the protocol you select you can enable SIEM Encryption.
	
	
	Server Port – add a port
	
	
	Exclude Headers - toggle switch to enable/disable log headers

	NOTE: If you disable log headers, you will only export data to SIEM.
	
	
	Log Types – select from the available options the logs to send to the SIEM Server

As per our discussion over the remote that we had, I've checked internally with the DevOps team if we can install the openvpn ourselves on the EPP server, but unfortunately they highlighted that no matter what third party software requires to be installed on the server  cannot be done by us- because the policy of the company is that as these tools are not tested we cannot assume responsibility for any damage they can possible do.
As per this I am sending you attached a disclamer that you will need to acknowledge, accept and sign. Eventually I will create an additional root account for you so that you can proceed installing the openvpn.
