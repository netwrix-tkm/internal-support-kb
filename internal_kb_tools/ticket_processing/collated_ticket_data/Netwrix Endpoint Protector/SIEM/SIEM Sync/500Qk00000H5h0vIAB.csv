We are requesting your assistance to remotely access our customer's EPP server to investigate an issue related to SIEM synchronization.

Recently, our customer reconfigured the SIEM settings on their EPP server due to infrastructure changes. Unfortunately, since this reconfiguration, no logs are being synchronized to the SIEM server.

We request your assistance to inspect the backend of the EPP server to identify and resolve the underlying issue. We propose scheduling a remote inspection for tomorrow at 15:00 or 16:00 Indonesian time.
Please let us know if this time is convenient for you and please send us the remote link before the session starts. 

Thank you for your help.
