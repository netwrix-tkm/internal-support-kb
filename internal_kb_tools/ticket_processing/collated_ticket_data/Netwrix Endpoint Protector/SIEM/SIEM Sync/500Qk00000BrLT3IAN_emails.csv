The server was received as an AMI and was installed on your AWS by the representative of your company.
As for how the SumoLogic agent was installed I will have to check internally and get back to you, since regularly, customers do not receive SSH access unless they sign a waiver.
I will get back to you next week after I inquire.

Thank you,

I apologize it taking this long, but I am trying to find someone who can tell me if your company initiated an SSH access procedure, and I do not have an answer yet.
If you have checks to make in the back-end of the server and you know where to look, we can set up a remote session and I will access the back-end and look together.
If you can wait until I manage to get an answer, we can take it from there and see how to best handle it.

Hi Eduard,

Thank you for the update. Either approach works for me. We need to restart
the log forwarder on the machine to re-establish log ingestion from the EPP
server to our SIEM.
Please let me know if we can have a live session to go through that.
