We are trying to ingest the Netwrix Endpoint protector logs to our siem log forwarder hosted internally in our onprem server. We have made all the configurations that required to send logs from Endpoint protector to Siem server but the logs are not being captured in the console.

Requesting your assistance to resolve this issue.

With regards,
