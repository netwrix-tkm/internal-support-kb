I am using splunk sc4s to recieve syslog from epp to our splunk, however once i turn on the encryption the logs stop flowing. I have confirmed with splunk that everything on their side is working as expected, so I would like to check the epp side. I would like to have a session where we get into the our epp server and check the tls configuration on it, as it seems that the problem lies there.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-31T07:57:55.000Z"
