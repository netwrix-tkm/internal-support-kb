"500Qk00000BrLT3IAN","00412022","Support Ticket","Unable to access EPP server, no key pair.","Hello,
I am addressing a logging issue with the EPP DLP server on one of our AWS EC2 instances. This server has a Sumo Logic collector agent deployed to forward logs to our SIEM server. However, I discovered that the assigned key pair is missing, preventing me from troubleshooting the problem. I am unsure how the EPP server was deployed, who deployed it, whether it was created from an existing AMI, and if there should be a way to access it remotely. 

Could you assist with this?

Thanks!","","","","SIEM connection has been restored","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","73.8","Closed - Resolved","TrueAccord","Chris Moody","2024-06-14T19:26:26.000Z","2024-08-27T15:12:13.000Z"
