In Ministry of Agriculture of Republic of Latvia Netwrix Endpoint protector environment previously was set up log sending to FortiSIEM. On this years March we upgraded out Endpoint protector server to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS l and after this upgrade we see that Endpoint protector isn't sending any logs. 
Reviewing firewall logs I see that there isn't any connection (allowed and blocked) from Netwrix Endpoint protector server to log collector. All ports are open between these servers. 

I have tried to recreate setup of SIEM integration, but with no results.

Can You please guide us through addition troubleshooting possibilities on this problem?Â ","","","","The customer confirmed that we can close the ticket after we saved once again the SIEM configuration and everything was working fine.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","5940","8.8","Closed - Resolved","Squalio Latvia","Toms Vesperis","2024-10-16T12:44:48.000Z","2024-10-25T07:48:56.000Z"
