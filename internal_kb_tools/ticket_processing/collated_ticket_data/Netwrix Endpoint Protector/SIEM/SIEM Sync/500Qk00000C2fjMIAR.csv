"500Qk00000C2fjMIAR","00412367","Support Ticket","SIEM Integration","Good morning,
  I'm trying to setup SIEM integration in order to send logging over to our cyber security SIEM tool. I set up the SIEM integration within Endpoint Protector, but I'm not receiving any log data in the SIEM. If I can have a quick working session to verify that my setup is correct, that would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Nicholas","","","","the issue was resolved by the customer, there was a configuration error on their side","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","156.1","Closed - Resolved","Fit Cyber Security","Nicholas Inverno","2024-06-19T17:51:54.000Z","2024-11-22T21:25:17.000Z"
