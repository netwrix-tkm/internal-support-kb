"500Qk00000OKz7zIAD","00442829","Support Ticket","SIEM Logging Issue","Our SIEM integration ceased working within the past week. We're no longer receiving any logs from this system. I've worked with our firewall admins and have validated that we're not seeing any traffic between the Endpoint Protector server and the destination syslog server.

I'm looking for some assistance troubleshooting from the Endpoint Protector side of things to ensure we're not having a problem there. I was hoping for some guidance with reviewing logs to see if there's any errors that are occurring with this function.","","","","After the migration the new server could not use Syslog-ng in order to send the logs to siem as it was not enabled in the database.
I manually updated the database to support syslog-ng and then the logs were sent to siem.","Other","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","5.8","Closed - Resolved","Chevron Phillips Chemical","John Randolph","2025-04-22T19:54:46.000Z","2025-04-28T15:31:09.000Z"
