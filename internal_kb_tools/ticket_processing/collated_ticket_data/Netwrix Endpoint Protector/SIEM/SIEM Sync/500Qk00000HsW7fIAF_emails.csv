Hi Botond,

My settings are here. Syslog server was built in Azure VM (Ubuntu 24.04 / Rsyslog)
I opened inbond port 514 TCP and set Rsyslog 514 tcp as well.
The VM’s public IP is 20.43.241.69

In EPP settings, I set like below.

Thank you so much

Hi. Botond

I haven’t used Ubuntu OS before. In that mind,  I uninstalled rsyslog and installed syslog-ng.
However when I tried to see status of syslog-ng. It failed starting.
Depending on various search, I have tried couple things that the search recommends.But all failed.
I feel I messed up this ubuntu vm machine.

Is there any way I can get remote help that your engineer access my computer via Zoom or Teams.
If yes, I can factory reset this Ubuntu VM in Azure and let you play in clean environment.

Please let me know.
Thank you

Hi Botond,

My settings are here. Syslog server was built in Azure VM (Ubuntu 24.04 / Rsyslog)
I opened inbond port 514 TCP and set Rsyslog 514 tcp as well.
The VM’s public IP is 20.43.241.69

In EPP settings, I set like below.
[cid:156350c2-22ea-4b07-a6e4-75232b975bd2@Image_0_]
I would like to ask your thought about the setting. If you think something is not correct, please give me advice.
Thank you so much

Best,
Taeyoung

Hi Taeyoung,

Thanks for reaching out!
Usually, this is set up by the customer in the SIEM solution they use. Could you please check if you have a location setting on your SIEM solution?

Hi Taeyoung,

Unfortunately we cannot troubleshoot issues on the SIEM server side.
The EPP server is working with a lot of different SIEM solutions for our customers.
We can have a remote session to check if the EPP server communicates with your SIEM server.

Hi. Botond

 

I haven’t used Ubuntu OS before. In that mind,  I uninstalled rsyslog and installed syslog-ng.

However when I tried to see status of syslog-ng. It failed starting.

Depending on various search, I have tried couple things that the search recommends.But all failed.

I feel I messed up this ubuntu vm machine.

 

Is there any way I can get remote help that your engineer access my computer via Zoom or Teams.

If yes, I can factory reset this Ubuntu VM in Azure and let you play in clean environment.

 

Please let me know.

Thank you

Hi Taeyoung,

We are using syslog-ng for logs, you said that you build an Rsyslog server.
Would it be possible to modify it?
Other than that, the settings look ok.
