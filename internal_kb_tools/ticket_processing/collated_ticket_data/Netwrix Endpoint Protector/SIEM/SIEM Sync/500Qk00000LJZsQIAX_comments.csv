We managed to stop the flood of messages by doing the following:

1. service nginx stop
2. Edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf
3. Find this line:
   #ForwardToWall=yes
   and change it to
   ForwardToWall=no
4. systemctl restart systemd-journald
5. service nginx start

The messages stopped, and the logs continued to be generated.

Follow-up question, is there a way to test the connection to their SIEM server if they configured it with a UDP protocol?

Thanks,
Boti","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-02-11T18:30:28.000Z","2025-02-11T18:30:28.000Z","false","false"

Hi,

Please check the following:

--- CODE ---telnet IP_SIEM PORT
--- CODE ---

If telnet IP_SIEM PORT returns an error, it usually means one of the following issues:
      1. The SIEM server is not listening on the specified port.

      2. A firewall is blocking the connection.

      3. The service on that port is down or misconfigured.

--- CODE ---
ping IP_SERVER
--- CODE ---

Share with us the syslog errors.

--- CODE ---
ls -al /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
tcpdump -vv port <PORT>
--- CODE ---

Captures both TCP and UDP traffic on the specified port


--- CODE ---
tcpdump -n udp port <PORT>
--- CODE ---

Captures only UDP packets on the specified port

You can test the connection to a SIEM server configured with a UDP protocol

--- CODE ---tcpdump -i any -n udp port <PORT>
--- CODE ---


If you have some other relevant information please share with us.
