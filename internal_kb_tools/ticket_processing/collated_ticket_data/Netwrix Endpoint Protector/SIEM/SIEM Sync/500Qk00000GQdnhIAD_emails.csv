 Hi Himanshu,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  I have checked in the backend of your EPP Appliance and can see that the SIEM logs service are running fine and that the SIEM logs are generating.  However when testing for communication to
sudo tcpdump dst ras.tecplix.com and port 1516 then there is no results / no response.  I opened a case with our Dev team for further investigation.  In the meanwhile, can I ask that you delete the SIEM configuration from your EPP Server via the web interface and set it up again please?  Please let me know when you have done this so that we can check again.




Kind regards

Hi Himanshu,

ASs we are hosting your EPP appliance and in order for us to check some points in your EPP appliance back-end we need your approval in writing first.
Could you kindly provide us the approval to access the backend of your EPP appliance via SSH which is hosted by us please?

We can see that the logs are being generated on the EPP Server but the issue seems to be the connection between the EPP Server and your SIEM solution.
We also noticed that UDP is used for the communication between the EPP Server and the SIEM solution, could you please confirm which SIEM solution you are using and if the UDP port is open?

 Hi Himanshu,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  I have checked in the backend of your EPP Appliance and can see that the SIEM logs service are running fine and that the SIEM logs are generating.  However when testing for communication to 
sudo tcpdump dst ras.tecplix.com and port 1516 then there is no results / no response.  I opened a case with our Dev team for further investigation.  In the meanwhile, can I ask that you delete the SIEM configuration from your EPP Server via the web interface and set it up again please?  Please let me know when you have done this so that we can check again.




Kind regards

Hi Himanshu,

We can see that the logs are being generated on the EPP Server but the issue seems to be the connection between the EPP Server and your SIEM solution.
We also noticed that UDP is used for the communication between the EPP Server and the SIEM solution, could you please confirm which SIEM solution you are using and if the UDP port is open?



Kind regards

 Hi Himanshu,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  I have checked in the backend of your EPP Appliance and can see that the SIEM logs service are running fine and that the SIEM logs are generating.  However when testing for communication to
sudo tcpdump dst ras.tecplix.com and port 1516 then there is no results / no response.  I opened a case with our Dev team for further investigation.  In the meanwhile, can I ask that you delete the SIEM configuration from your EPP Server via the web interface and set it up again please?  Please let me know when you have done this so that we can check again.

Thank you for confirming.  We noticed that there are two SIEM servers configured both with the same destination FQDN and this is causing issues.  Can you remove one from the EPP Server's UI and let me know when this is done please?

Hi Himanshu,

We can see that the logs are being generated on the EPP Server but the issue seems to be the connection between the EPP Server and your SIEM solution.
We also noticed that UDP is used for the communication between the EPP Server and the SIEM solution, could you please confirm which SIEM solution you are using and if the UDP port is open?

 Hi Himanshu,

I would like to give you an update on this case.  I have checked in the backend of your EPP Appliance and can see that the SIEM logs service are running fine and that the SIEM logs are generating.  However when testing for communication to 
sudo tcpdump dst ras.tecplix.com and port 1516 then there is no results / no response.  I opened a case with our Dev team for further investigation.  In the meanwhile, can I ask that you delete the SIEM configuration from your EPP Server via the web interface and set it up again please?  Please let me know when you have done this so that we can check again.

Hi Himanshu,

ASs we are hosting your EPP appliance and in order for us to check some points in your EPP appliance back-end we need your approval in writing first.
Could you kindly provide us the approval to access the backend of your EPP appliance via SSH which is hosted by us please?

Kind regards
