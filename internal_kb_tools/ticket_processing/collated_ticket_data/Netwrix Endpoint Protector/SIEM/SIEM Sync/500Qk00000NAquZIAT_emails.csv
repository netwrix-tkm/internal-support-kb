Hello,

There are no File Rename events in the EPP UI because no there were not any manual file name changes.
EPP server automatically creates a hash sum of the shadow copied file and stores it on the server in this way.
We suggested for customer to try to use SIEM [File Hash] field to correlate it with the shadow copy file name what is stored in the S3 Bucket.

Indeed, that is the best option that you suggested to the customer, since there are no entries for the creation of the hash sum, which means they won't show up as logs.
