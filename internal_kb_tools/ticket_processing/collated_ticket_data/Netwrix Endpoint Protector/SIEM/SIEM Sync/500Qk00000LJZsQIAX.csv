CIANDT always used splunk and is now migrating to secops, they did all the process to sync but no log is getting there. Do you know if the EPP sends to one and the logs cannot be fowarded to the other? I can show the configuration too so we can discuss before asking for a meeting.

Best regards,","","- customer uses 2 siem solutions until the cutover
- the first one, splunk, is working, the second one, secops, is not
- the customer sent screenshots of the setup
- the customer gave me access to their backend to check the connection, however Broadcast messages are being generated continuously, so no commands can be run
- managed to stop the messages from being shows on the console
- asked if there is a way to test the connection to the customer's SIEM server if they configured it with UDP","waititing on R&D
during today's meeting the customer discovered that the issue is on their side.
Lucas will followup in case a new meeting is needed.","Customer confirmed we can close.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","SIEM","SIEM Sync","","","38.9","Closed - Resolved","FC Brasil","Lucas Cavalcante","2025-01-31T15:17:19.000Z","2025-03-11T13:59:16.000Z"
