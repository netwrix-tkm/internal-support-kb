"500Qk00000NBgwTIAT","00439655","Support Ticket","Download been classified as upload.","When investigating EPP logs. We notice that browser downloads has two set of entries: first, a bunch of logs with 'xxxx.crdownload' as source and Chrome as destination, then when completed, it shows the downloaded file as source and Chrome as destination. Why does EPP incorrectly log downloads as potential browser uploads? This creates unnecessary noise in our security monitoring.","","We asked for more details about the scenario where the epp is generating logs for web browser downloads.

We scheduled a remote session for next Monday.

This issue cannot be replicated on demand so we provided the customer with the steps to generate the appended logs for MAC and Linux OS, and after the issue reproduces they will send us the logs to raise and R&D escalation.

The customer is not able to reproduce the issue and asked to leave the ticket open until Friday (11 April)","Waiting for more details from the customer.

Review the issue in the remote session and collect the logs if necessary.

Waiting for the customer to replicate the issue, collect the logs, and send them to us for raising an R&D escalation ticket.","The issue is no longer reproducing.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","Reports & Analysis / Logs","Server Upgrade","","","24.9","Closed - Resolved","Black Sesame Technologies","Tai Ting Tseng","2025-03-21T16:48:12.000Z","2025-04-15T14:16:23.000Z"
