Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that the location mentioned corresponds to sources of files that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:


	Block the website that the end user is using.
	Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
	Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.


Implementing these options should help prevent these log entries from appearing in the future.

Please let us know if you have further questions or if there's anything we can assist with.

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user “hengliu”’s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac’s Keychain.

Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user’s download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

 

For the instruction you provide:


	Block the website that the end user is using.


This can’t be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.


	Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.


Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?


	Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.


The source location is the general user’s download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don’t think that is a good practice. 

 

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example: 

 

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs. 

2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later). 

3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs. 

4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content. 

 

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state. 

 

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hello Iosif, 

 

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.

The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user “hengliu”’s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac’s Keychain.

Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user’s download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

 

For the instruction you provide:


	Block the website that the end user is using.


This can’t be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.


	Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.


Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?


	Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.


The source location is the general user’s download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don’t think that is a good practice. 

 

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hello Iosif,

We are not able to locate the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" under Device Control -> Global Settings.
We do find the option under ""Settings"", however it can only apply to Windows platform and this issue occurred on Mac. Please instruct how to configure for Mac and Linux platform?

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
  2.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
  3.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

Implementing these options should help prevent these log entries from appearing in the future.

It only allowed to show 200 logs on the web UI, I will try to explain the scenario based it. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Hi Tai,

The DPI settings are located under Device Control -> Global Settings. However, the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" option is indeed available only for Windows systems.
[cid:image002.png@01DB9EFB.1F994580]
Could you please let us know your availability for a remote session? This will allow us to collect more data about this behavior.

Thank you!

Hello Iosif,

We are not able to locate the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" under Device Control -> Global Settings.
We do find the option under ""Settings"", however it can only apply to Windows platform and this issue occurred on Mac. Please instruct how to configure for Mac and Linux platform?

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
  2.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.

It only allowed to show 200 logs on the web UI, I will try to explain the scenario based it. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

We would like to activate logging for the EPP client on the Mac computer and collect the logs after we reproduce the scenario with the download file. You will need admin rights on the Mac to execute a few commands in the terminal, and having an EPP admin user would be helpful if we need to change settings in the EPP UI console.

Is it ok to schedule the remote session for tomorrow from 11:00 to 12:00 PST?

Please let me know if this time works for you or if you have another preference.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Hi Tai,

We would like to activate logging for the EPP client on the Mac computer and collect the logs after we reproduce the scenario with the download file. You will need admin rights on the Mac to execute a few commands in the terminal, and having an EPP admin user would be helpful if we need to change settings in the EPP UI console.

Is it ok to schedule the remote session for tomorrow from 11:00 to 12:00 PST?

Please let me know if this time works for you or if you have another preference.

Thank you!

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
  2.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
  3.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

Implementing these options should help prevent these log entries from appearing in the future.

Please let us know if you have further questions or if there's anything we can assist with.

It only allowed to show 200 logs on the web UI, I will try to explain the scenario based it. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hi Tai,

The ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" improves the interaction with third-party applications.
Could you please enable this option and let us know if you still see these logs?

Thank you!

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
  2.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
  3.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

Implementing these options should help prevent these log entries from appearing in the future.

Please let us know if you have further questions or if there's anything we can assist with.

It only allowed to show 200 logs on the web UI, I will try to explain the scenario based it. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Hi Tai,

We would like to activate logging for the EPP client on the Mac computer and collect the logs after we reproduce the scenario with the download file. You will need admin rights on the Mac to execute a few commands in the terminal, and having an EPP admin user would be helpful if we need to change settings in the EPP UI console.

Is it ok to schedule the remote session for tomorrow from 11:00 to 12:00 PST?

Please let me know if this time works for you or if you have another preference.

Thank you!

Hi Tai,

The DPI settings are located under Device Control -> Global Settings. However, the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" option is indeed available only for Windows systems.


Could you please let us know your availability for a remote session? This will allow us to collect more data about this behavior.

Hello Iosif,

We are not able to locate the “Use Stealthy DPI Driver” under Device Control -> Global Settings.
We do find the option under “Settings”, however it can only apply to Windows platform and this issue occurred on Mac. Please instruct how to configure for Mac and Linux platform?

Hi Tai,

Unfortunately, I don't have any available time slots for this afternoon. However, I'm available on Monday from 11:00 to 12:00 or 12:00 to 1:00 PM PST. Do either of these times work for you?

Thank you!

Hi Tai,

We would like to activate logging for the EPP client on the Mac computer and collect the logs after we reproduce the scenario with the download file. You will need admin rights on the Mac to execute a few commands in the terminal, and having an EPP admin user would be helpful if we need to change settings in the EPP UI console.

Is it ok to schedule the remote session for tomorrow from 11:00 to 12:00 PST?

Please let me know if this time works for you or if you have another preference.

Thank you!

We are not able to locate the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" under Device Control -> Global Settings.
We do find the option under ""Settings"", however it can only apply to Windows platform and this issue occurred on Mac. Please instruct how to configure for Mac and Linux platform?

Hello Iosif,

Thank you for the suggestion, here I will provide another example to better describe the situation. Please see attached screenshot.
The log is recorded when I finished installing EPP on user ""hengliu""'s laptop and trying to download the certificates from our NAS. The zip downloaded contain one cer file, one crt file and one pem file. Upon installing the certificate will set EPP server as the trusted site in Mac's Keychain.
Now, from your explanation, the log has been recorded because the location (user's download folder) mentioned corresponds to sources of files (certificate zip) that are accessed or called when visiting a specific website (NAS server). However, since the browser is trying to write the file into download folder, it will definitely access the .crdownload file (a.k.a. temporary state of the download file). This is clear to be a download behavior as I am the person who download the file and the zip contains no python or shell script for the NAS server to trigger, why EPP still record this log?

For the instruction you provide:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
This can't be done, as the site is the the NAS storage site used by IT.

  1.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
Please explain what this option do and how it improve the log output?

  1.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

The source location is the general user's download folder, whitelist it means any user can upload anything from their download folder without been monitor. I don't think that is a good practice.

Please provide a more solid solution to address the download been identified as upload issue. Thank you.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for sending us the screenshot.

Upon internal review, it appears that. These files seem to be either Python or shell scripts triggered by the website that the user is accessing.

To prevent these logs from appearing on the server, you can consider the following options:

  1.  Block the website that the end user is using.
  2.  Utilize the DPI with the ""Use Stealthy DPI Driver"" functionality.
  3.  Whitelist the source location displayed in the logs. A wildcard can be used if the source is similar for multiple users.

Implementing these options should help prevent these log entries from appearing in the future.

Please let us know if you have further questions or if there's anything we can assist with.

It only allowed to show 200 logs on the web UI, I will try to explain the scenario based it. Please see the attached screenshot for reference.

Using user Zihaozhao's activity as an example:

1. At 14:59:45 on 02-19, we observe the file ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" first appearing in the logs.
2. This file continues to appear in the logs until 15:54:51 on 02-19 (approximately 55 minutes later).
3. Immediately after ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" stops appearing, the file ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" begins to show up in the logs.
4. Upon comparing both files, we confirmed they have identical size and content.

Based on this evidence, it appears that ""bst-dal-tutorial-bevdel-v1.1.0.tar.gz"" was the file being downloaded, with ""Unconfirmed 813951.crdownload"" being its temporary download state.

This observation contradicts your statement that EPP should not generate logs for downloads. Could you please explain this discrepancy? Also, for your information, the Destination Detail are empty for all the logs mentioned above. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.

Hi Tai,

Thank you for reaching out.

The EPP is not designed to generate logs specifically for downloads. However, if you can provide a detailed description of the scenario where you observe these logs, it would help us better understand your situation.

There might be instances where, after downloading a file such as 'xxxx.crdownload,' the file hash or other information is sent for validation to a server. This action might appear as a web upload in the logs.

Please enable the Destination Details in the log page and send us some screenshots so we can assist you further.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Thank you for joining today's remote session.

Below are the steps to generate and collect EPP logs for Mac and Linux computers:
Linux: 
 
1. $ sudo su
2. $ cd /var/log/epp-client/
3. $ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log
4. $ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
5. $ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart

6. replicate the issue / allow the issue to reproduce itself

7. $ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon_append.log /home/user/Desktop/
8. $ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/

MAC:

sudo /bin/launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log
sudo touch /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log
sudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cososys.eppclient.launchdaemon.plist

After this, let the issue reproduce a few times (wait for the computer to duplicate on the EPP UI a few more times). Once this happens, collect the logs with the following commands:

cp /private/var/log/eppclient_append.log ~/Desktop
cp /private/var/log/eppsslsplit.log ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/reprovision.db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/rights.s3db ~/Desktop
cp /etc/epp/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json ~/Desktop

Please archive the above log files after the issue is reproduced and send them to us along with a screenshot of the log from the Report and Analysis. We will then raise the issue internally with our development team for further investigation.

Hello Tai Ting,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00439655. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00439655
Ticket Subject: Download been classified as upload.
Ticket Details: When investigating EPP logs. We notice that browser downloads has two set of entries: first, a bunch of logs with 'xxxx.crdownload' as source and Chrome as destination, then when completed, it shows the downloaded file as source and Chrome as destination. Why does EPP incorrectly log downloads as potential browser uploads? This creates unnecessary noise in our security monitoring.

Thank you!

Hello Tai Ting,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00439655. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00439655
Ticket Subject: Download been classified as upload.
Ticket Details: When investigating EPP logs. We notice that browser downloads has two set of entries: first, a bunch of logs with 'xxxx.crdownload' as source and Chrome as destination, then when completed, it shows the downloaded file as source and Chrome as destination. Why does EPP incorrectly log downloads as potential browser uploads? This creates unnecessary noise in our security monitoring.

Thank you!
