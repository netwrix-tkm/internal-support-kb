We notice that browser downloads has two set of entries: first, a bunch of logs with 'xxxx.crdownload' as source and Chrome as destination, then when completed, it shows the downloaded file as source and Chrome as destination. Why does EPP incorrectly log downloads as potential browser uploads? This creates unnecessary noise in our security monitoring.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-21T16:48:13.000Z"
