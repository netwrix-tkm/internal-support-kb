I finally received feedback from the engineering team.
Turning Reporting V2 on from System Configuration -> System setting should fix the missing destination details:


Please note that for older logs, the destination will not be available anymore. You will see just the new ones, after you enable the feature.

Hi Bontond, 

 

 

After I enabled the feature, I could see the website URL but no files showing in the records.

Do you know why it is like this?

 



 


No file shadow either.

Hi Bontond, 

 

 

After I enabled the feature, I could see the website URL but no files showing in the records.

Do you know why it is like this?

Hi Kurt,

Does it show what type of file was uploaded to those websites?
Could you please check if file shadowing is enabled for that user?

Hi Bontond,


After I enabled the feature, I could see the website URL but no files showing in the records.
Do you know why it is like this?

No file shadow either.

If the download button still doesn't work, my colleagues suggested you try from another browser.
And if that doesn't work, collect the diagnostics again, and try to download them after 30 minutes - 1 hour.

Hi Kurt,

I opened a new case for this issue - 00428245, and escalated it internally so we can figure out why the logs cannot be downloaded.
I will keep you updated.
