We are wanting to clear out false positives, validate policies, essentially do a crash course for reviewing logs and validating policy. 

I would like one call to review policies in place, and validate things are working. We are still seeing policies not being applied.

I would like a secondary call that will work as a crash course for reviewing and going over results, clearing out bad data. 

Thank you,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-27T17:22:47.000Z"

the customer is relatively unhappy with the product as it lacks some features like giving a correct or incorrect ""feedback"" for report entries, because there are too many false positives and because it's a lot of manual work to set it all up","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-01-29T21:04:05.000Z"
