We are wanting to clear out false positives, validate policies, essentially do a crash course for reviewing logs and validating policy. 

I would like one call to review policies in place, and validate things are working. We are still seeing policies not being applied.

I would like a secondary call that will work as a crash course for reviewing and going over results, clearing out bad data. 

Thank you,","","created dictionaries for bank accounts and credit cards to mitigate the false positives
