I've made some tests and in my case destination details are detected and reported by the EPP client. Double checked your logs and it seems that you have no issues there, it's just that you did not enable LogsV2. Without LogsV2 you will not have the Destination Details column displayed in the EPP server. Also please note that for older logs, the destination will not be available anymore. You will see just the new ones, after you enable the feature.

Did you discuss this in the support team? That is probably a false positive. It is not mentioned, but I suppose they don't get all time Web upload. Am I right? Any logs with different scenarios tested?

There are no logs attached recently to this issue. I tried to use the Salesforce case number as well, but no logs there either.

Hi Botond,



I think there is a lot of back and forth and we don't get anywhere. We started this with Destination Details missing. That was because logsv2 was not enabled. I did not get any confirmation that after enabling logsV2 this was fixed, but I suppose it was. 




Moving further, a different issue was reported, the one related to Web Upload. That should probably get into a different ADO, but OK, we can continue on this one here. I already mentioned that the Web Upload part is probably a false positive. And this is something known. I asked more details, such as, do they get this all the time? I suppose they don't. 




Going forward, I just received a new set of logs, without any details. What did they test? When? The log file spans over 24 hours, it's a 15MB text file. Those details are usually important and help us to figure out more easily/rapidly what's happening. Anyway, I did investigate the logs and I can tell you there were a few clipboard threats that were detected and reported properly. Shadows as well. And yes, there were 3 threats that have as source Web Upload. I suppose that all of them are more or less false positives. I will try to explain. First of all, the customer monitors ""text/plain"" files. That's a really bad idea, when DPI is enabled. Not saying they should not monitor text files, but in that case they can expect to get multiple reports. Why is that? Well, because when the customer browses the internet, there is a lot of communication/requests that are not ""seen"" by the customer. Or because some apps, like OneDrive in this case is doing a lot of traffic in the background, even if the customer is not actually uploading a file at that moment. And in some cases, the EPP client can't make the different between a regular sync/communication and an actual file sync. In the 3 reports I mentioned above, one is from OneDrive and that might be covered by another issue that I already added a while ago and is targeted for 5950. Can't be sure yet. The other are requests made to atlassian.net, I tried to browse a little this destination but I did not manage to get reproduce the issue. Not sure what the customer was doing in that case. So, I think you can go just with explaining the customer that those were false positives. If they insist on a solution, we would need some scenarios to reproduce the issue and we will try to improve. That is pretty much what we are doing in these situations. If you need some more clarifications on what I explained above, feel free to contact me on Teams.

We did enable Reporting V2, but it didn’t help with the customer’s issue.

For the Web Upload issue I didn’t open a different ADO, because you mentioned it might be caused by false positives, and if that’s the case, it would be the same problem for both issues, as they don’t get this all the.

I can’t tell you what they tested, because they use the client on Hidden mode and that’s the reason the logs span over a larger period.

Thank you for the explanation, I will relay it to the customer, and I will ask for some scenarios for us to test and reproduce if they insist.

Thanks,
