Hi Andre, Cristi,
I know not what the cause of this behavior is. I propose to find a common time window and remotely connect to the customer together to look at the issue. If nothing else works I think we could take a default pam config file from latest package and overwrite the current one, then apply the updates and finally revert to our older one after the updates are successfully applied.

We did upgrade all packages on the system, keeping the altered-by-us pam config unmodified.
