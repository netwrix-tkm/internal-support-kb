Hi @Alin Anca ,

At the moment there are no updates on this as dev team is working on more urgent cases.

I will try to assign this as soon as possible.

Regards,
Cristi

@Alin Anca I suppose the issue is reproduced on this machine only. Did the customer tried other scenarios? Maybe CAP if they are using CAP also. Or some other file trace related scenarios maybe? According to what I see in the logs, none of the above is going to work. There is some problem related to the CAP driver that is not getting loaded. I recommend clearing the current installation and after that try again with a fresh install (best will be to use ZapEPP, clean everything (maybe run Zap twice), restart the machine and try after that a fresh install).
