You can check how many logs are stored in the server by accessing Reports and Analysis -> Logs report -> Sort the logs ascending based on the server/client time.
If you do not need to keep all the logs in the EPP Server, you can enable the Audit Log Backup, from System Maintenance, and it will backup and remove the logs older than a specific amount of time.

Regarding the possibility to select what logs you need to save, this can not be customized.

Best regards,
Emil

Thanks for you help!, 

But, if I wanted to proof or configure for how long I'd like to store logs, where should I do It? Or will the server store logs until the disk is full?, 

For PCI porpuses I'd Like to set the retention logs for one year, 

Is that possible?

It is possible to configure the Audit log backup in order to keep the logs in the database for 1 year and then to backup the logs older than 1 year and store them in csv files.

In order to set this up, you will have to access System Maintenance -> Audit Log backup -> Scroll to the scheduler backup -> Select All the log types -> Choose the frequency of the backup -> Do not set it to keep the backedup logs as this will not remove the logs from the database after the audit log backup is running -> Choose what logs to backup -> Do not include the fileshadows -> Schedule
Example below:


Best regards,
Emil
