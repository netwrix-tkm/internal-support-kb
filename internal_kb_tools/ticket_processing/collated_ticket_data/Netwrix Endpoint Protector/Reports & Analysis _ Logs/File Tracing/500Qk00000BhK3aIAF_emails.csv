If file Shadowing is enabled, it will generate a very small copy of the document on the server indeed.
But it is not an exact  1v1 copy of the document- the file should be reachable from Reports and Analysys- Content Aware Report-a Blue download bar should be present.
If you insist for a call, we can have one, but I am not sure what other information I could provide you with that is not already
in the manual. Have you checked that up?

Hi Vamshi,

If file Shadowing is enabled, it will generate a very small copy of the document on the server indeed.
But it is not an exact  1v1 copy of the document- the file should be reachable from Reports and Analysys- Content Aware Report-a Blue download bar should be present.
If you insist for a call, we can have one, but I am not sure what other information I could provide you with that is not already
in the manual. Have you checked that up?
