The shadows are missing from the server.

Please enable agent logging and attempt to replicate the issue to pinpoint whether the problem lies on the server side or the agent side.

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan could you please involve someone from the client team to have a look over the logs file?

Thanks.

@WaitingOnEngineer 


I think I know what is happening here, please ask the customer if Firefox was installed using Snap. If that's the case, ask them to test with another app as well, one that is not installed using Snap package manager. In that case, I expect shadowing to work. 


But please, keep in mind also that shadows should be generated only if the size of the file is less than ""Max file size for shadowing"". In the video you provided I saw some examples with missing shadows, but the file size was 140MB. Can't say what the actual max size set is because I don't have options.ini to check.

If we confirm this is a Snap related issue, you can inform the customer that this issue is already registered and targeted for 5.9.5.0, but that doesn't necessarily mean we will be able to fix it in this release.
