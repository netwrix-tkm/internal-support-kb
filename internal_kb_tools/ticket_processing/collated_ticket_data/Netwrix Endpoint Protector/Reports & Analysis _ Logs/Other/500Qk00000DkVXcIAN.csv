I am writing to request a copy of the MBSS (Minimum Baseline Security
Standard) document related to Endpoint Protector by cososys. This document is needed to
review and ensure our compliance with the security protocols and best
practices outlined by Cososys.

Could you please provide the MBSS document at your earliest

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
