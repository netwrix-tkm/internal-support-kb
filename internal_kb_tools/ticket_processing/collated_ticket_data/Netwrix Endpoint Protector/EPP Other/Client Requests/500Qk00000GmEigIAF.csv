"500Qk00000GmEigIAF","00423273","Support Ticket","Request to Disable DPI Bypassed Traffic Logs","Hi Team,

We are currently receiving logs related to DPI bypassed traffic in the endpoint protector system.
These logs seem to contain junk data, and they are defaulting to the ""Content Threat Detected"" logs category for analysis.

Could you please advise on how we can disable these DPI traffic logs in the portal, as they do not seem to provide useful information for our current setup?

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.","","","","Customer confirmed ticket can be closed as Solved:
