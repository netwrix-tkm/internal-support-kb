During the recent demo session for Netwrix EPP, the customer inquired about the following:

1.Does our EPP support Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati languages in the custom content deny list feature?
2.Are we compliant with the DPDP Act?
3.The customer is using the IceWarp email client with an on-premises email server. Does our solution support this setup?
4. Can we label a file as confidential, irrespective of its content, and restrict both its sharing and the ability to copy or paste the file?

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards.","","","","We do not support DPDP act","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Client Requests","","","23.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2024-09-03T08:27:46.000Z","2024-09-26T11:42:59.000Z"
