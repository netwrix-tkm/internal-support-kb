Shadows cannot be imported from one server to another. The best option would be to have Audit Log Backups with logs and shadows included and save them locally, or in a cloud environment.
Another option would be to use the older server powered off, and turn it on to another IP, if they need to check/investigate older shadows and logs.

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.
Would it be possible to download archives from the old server and then transfer them to the new EPP server via backend to the directory where the Audit Log Backups should be stored?
Customer cannot leave older server just powered off, they are planning to delete it after the migration.

That's right.
The logs can be moved, but only the logs. This would not be helpful in Privat Bank's case, because I was during our call today that they have a monthly Audit Log which deletes the logs that were archived, meaning only the last month's logs would be migrated.
Also, shadows cannot be migrated either.
This is why I recommended downloading the Audit Logs and keep them locally.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NJ6R6:ref

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.
Would it be possible to download archives from the old server and then transfer them to the new EPP server via backend to the directory where the Audit Log Backups should be stored?
Customer cannot leave older server just powered off, they are planning to delete it after the migration.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!

Shadows cannot be imported from one server to another. The best option would be to have Audit Log Backups with logs and shadows included and save them locally, or in a cloud environment.
Another option would be to use the older server powered off, and turn it on to another IP, if they need to check/investigate older shadows and logs.

Hi Danylo,

That's right.
The logs can be moved, but only the logs. This would not be helpful in Privat Bank's case, because I was during our call today that they have a monthly Audit Log which deletes the logs that were archived, meaning only the last month's logs would be migrated.
Also, shadows cannot be migrated either.
This is why I recommended downloading the Audit Logs and keep them locally.

I discussed this internally, and as we saw during the call, the Audit log cleared some of the shadows and the old logs.
Because of this, it seems that they have a huge amount of logs generated within the last 30 days. 
Therefore the best way to go would be, after the migration (so no new logs/shadows get created), to create an Audit Log Backup to contain all logs and shadows (select all at the Choose what logs to backup section) and download the audit logs.

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.

Would it be possible to download archives from the old server and then transfer them to the new EPP server via backend to the directory where the Audit Log Backups should be stored?

Customer cannot leave older server just powered off, they are planning to delete it after the migration.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!

Shadows cannot be imported from one server to another. The best option would be to have Audit Log Backups with logs and shadows included and save them locally, or in a cloud environment.
Another option would be to use the older server powered off, and turn it on to another IP, if they need to check/investigate older shadows and logs.

Hi Danylo,

I discussed this internally, and as we saw during the call, the Audit log cleared some of the shadows and the old logs.
Because of this, it seems that they have a huge amount of logs generated within the last 30 days.
Therefore the best way to go would be, after the migration (so no new logs/shadows get created), to create an Audit Log Backup to contain all logs and shadows (select all at the Choose what logs to backup section) and download the audit logs.

Hi Danylo,

That's right.
The logs can be moved, but only the logs. This would not be helpful in Privat Bank's case, because I was during our call today that they have a monthly Audit Log which deletes the logs that were archived, meaning only the last month's logs would be migrated.
Also, shadows cannot be migrated either.
This is why I recommended downloading the Audit Logs and keep them locally.

Hi Danylo,

Yes, we can leave it open.
Do you know what the target date for the migration is?

Hi Danylo,

I discussed this internally, and as we saw during the call, the Audit log cleared some of the shadows and the old logs.
Because of this, it seems that they have a huge amount of logs generated within the last 30 days.
Therefore the best way to go would be, after the migration (so no new logs/shadows get created), to create an Audit Log Backup to contain all logs and shadows (select all at the Choose what logs to backup section) and download the audit logs.

Hi Danylo,

That's right.
The logs can be moved, but only the logs. This would not be helpful in Privat Bank's case, because I was during our call today that they have a monthly Audit Log which deletes the logs that were archived, meaning only the last month's logs would be migrated.
Also, shadows cannot be migrated either.
This is why I recommended downloading the Audit Logs and keep them locally.

Hello,

So, the only way to store the old logs is to save the Audit Log Backup archives somewhere and there are no any possibilities to migrate the logs and shadows to new server?

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!

Shadows cannot be imported from one server to another. The best option would be to have Audit Log Backups with logs and shadows included and save them locally, or in a cloud environment.
Another option would be to use the older server powered off, and turn it on to another IP, if they need to check/investigate older shadows and logs.

Hi Danylo,

I discussed this internally, and as we saw during the call, the Audit log cleared some of the shadows and the old logs.
Because of this, it seems that they have a huge amount of logs generated within the last 30 days. 
Therefore the best way to go would be, after the migration (so no new logs/shadows get created), to create an Audit Log Backup to contain all logs and shadows (select all at the Choose what logs to backup section) and download the audit logs.

Hi Danylo,

That's right.
The logs can be moved, but only the logs. This would not be helpful in Privat Bank's case, because I was during our call today that they have a monthly Audit Log which deletes the logs that were archived, meaning only the last month's logs would be migrated.
Also, shadows cannot be migrated either.
This is why I recommended downloading the Audit Logs and keep them locally.

Hello,

Thank you for the information.

So, the only way to store the old logs is to save the Audit Log Backup archives somewhere and there are no any possibilities to migrate the logs and shadows to new server?

Hello,

Thank you for your answer.

Would it be possible to download archives from the old server and then transfer them to the new EPP server via backend to the directory where the Audit Log Backups should be stored?

Customer cannot leave older server just powered off, they are planning to delete it after the migration.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out!

Shadows cannot be imported from one server to another. The best option would be to have Audit Log Backups with logs and shadows included and save them locally, or in a cloud environment.
Another option would be to use the older server powered off, and turn it on to another IP, if they need to check/investigate older shadows and logs.

Hello!

Customer is planning to migrate in the near future, but does not know exactly the date.
I think we can close this ticket now, and if customer asks additional questions, I will make a follow-up.
Thank you for your assistance.
