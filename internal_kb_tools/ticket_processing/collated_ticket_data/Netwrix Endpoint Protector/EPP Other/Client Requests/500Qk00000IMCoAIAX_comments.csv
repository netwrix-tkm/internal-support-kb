Hello Andre, @WaitingOnEngineer

Happy New Year! 

The last time I checked I could not reproduce this issue as the number of threats was shown correctly on my server. I will do some more verifications and I will come back with a feedback as soon as possible. 

Thank you!

Hello @WaitingOnEngineer,

After trying to reproduce this case both on Mac OS and Windows, I was unsuccessful. I have prepared a test build with some additional logs in order to better understand what data we are sending to the server, and to compare the number displayed there with what is being sent. 

Please try to reproduce this again with the test build and provide the new set of logs. 

The test build is located at \192.168.14.5Publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_01_29EppMac_v3.0.4.0024

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan could you please provide a download link for this build?

""I have reproduced the issue with test build 3.0.4.0024 and see that CAP report still show wrong count as same as before. The test scenario is exactly same as before:
- policy is block and report - Ignore threshold is OFF - file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers - content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20) - Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries

After looking into the logs, I found what happens and managed to reproduce this issue on my machine, too. 

I am currently working on a fix for this. I will return with an update and a test build if the fix works right.

Hello @WaitingOnEngineer,

I prepared a test build with a fix for this issue. The problem was caused by an inconsistence between the threat count and the threats that were added to the threat list. Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.


Please use the test build to check if the problem is fixed. The test build is located here: \192.168.14.5publicgroups_daily_buildsCoSoSys2025-builds2025_03_13EppMac_v3.0.4.0039
