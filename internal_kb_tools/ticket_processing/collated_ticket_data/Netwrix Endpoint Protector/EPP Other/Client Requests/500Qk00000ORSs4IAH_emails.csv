Thank you for your email.
It would be benefic if you can start the logs before the issue happens, but as you mentioned that it occurs randomly, we will try to investigate it as it is.
Please see the steps below on how to collect log files from a Windows OS computer:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access an internet site (so that the issue is reproduced)
7. Restart the computer (as you mentioned that is the workaround)
8. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
9. Try to access an internet site (it should work as you mentioned that after the restart, internet browsing is possible)
10. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
11. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

The IP of the server is 3.6.9.100

Would it be possible to take the logs at a later time?
Does the affected computer use any antivirus or endpoit control apps, or proxy/VPN's?
In case of proxy/VPN can you confirm what port is used?

Can you please check in Device Control > Global Settings if the Deep Packet INspection  option is enabled?
If it is, please disable it, save the settign and updatethe policeis on the Epp client, then check if the issue remians.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
It would be benefic if you can start the logs before the issue happens, but as you mentioned that it occurs randomly, we will try to investigate it as it is.
Please see the steps below on how to collect log files from a Windows OS computer:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access an internet site (so that the issue is reproduced)
7. Restart the computer (as you mentioned that is the workaround)
8. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
9. Try to access an internet site (it should work as you mentioned that after the restart, internet browsing is possible)
10. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
11. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

The IP of the server is 3.6.9.100

Hello,

Would it be possible to take the logs at a later time?
Does the affected computer use any antivirus or endpoit control apps, or proxy/VPN's?
In case of proxy/VPN can you confirm what port is used?

Can you please check in Device Control > Global Settings if the Deep Packet INspection  option is enabled?
If it is, please disable it, save the settign and updatethe policeis on the Epp client, then check if the issue remians.

Kind regards

Recently I checked that the web browser does not pick certificates on Windows machines in which this issue persists. I could not collect the logs due to some important calls of user. Screenshot of the same is below :

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
It would be benefic if you can start the logs before the issue happens, but as you mentioned that it occurs randomly, we will try to investigate it as it is.
Please see the steps below on how to collect log files from a Windows OS computer:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access an internet site (so that the issue is reproduced)
7. Restart the computer (as you mentioned that is the workaround)
8. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
9. Try to access an internet site (it should work as you mentioned that after the restart, internet browsing is possible)
10. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
11. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

The IP of the server is 3.6.9.100

Hello,

Would it be possible to take the logs at a later time?
Does the affected computer use any antivirus or endpoit control apps, or proxy/VPN's?
In case of proxy/VPN can you confirm what port is used?

Can you please check in Device Control > Global Settings if the Deep Packet INspection  option is enabled?
If it is, please disable it, save the settign and updatethe policeis on the Epp client, then check if the issue remians.

Kind regards

Recently I checked that the web browser does not pick certificates on Windows machines in which this issue persists. I could not collect the logs due to some important calls of user. Screenshot of the same is below :

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
It would be benefic if you can start the logs before the issue happens, but as you mentioned that it occurs randomly, we will try to investigate it as it is.
Please see the steps below on how to collect log files from a Windows OS computer:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access an internet site (so that the issue is reproduced)
7. Restart the computer (as you mentioned that is the workaround)
8. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
9. Try to access an internet site (it should work as you mentioned that after the restart, internet browsing is possible)
10. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
11. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

The IP of the server is 3.6.9.100

Hello,
 
Thank you for your reply.

For the remote session you will need to have access to an affected computer as I would need to gather a set of logs.

Sure, 4:30.
This is happening because the DPI option is responsible to exclude sites.

Is it possible to connect 4:30 as after Disabling DPI , policy is getting applied on excluded sites as well.

Hello,

Would it be possible to take the logs at a later time?
Does the affected computer use any antivirus or endpoit control apps, or proxy/VPN's?
In case of proxy/VPN can you confirm what port is used?

Can you please check in Device Control > Global Settings if the Deep Packet INspection  option is enabled?
If it is, please disable it, save the settign and updatethe policeis on the Epp client, then check if the issue remians.

Kind regards

Recently I checked that the web browser does not pick certificates on Windows machines in which this issue persists. I could not collect the logs due to some important calls of user. Screenshot of the same is below :

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
It would be benefic if you can start the logs before the issue happens, but as you mentioned that it occurs randomly, we will try to investigate it as it is.
Please see the steps below on how to collect log files from a Windows OS computer:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Append Log Files"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Try to access an internet site (so that the issue is reproduced)
7. Restart the computer (as you mentioned that is the workaround)
8. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
9. Try to access an internet site (it should work as you mentioned that after the restart, internet browsing is possible)
10. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
11. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

The IP of the server is 3.6.9.100

Also please share the IP of the Server as well. So I can check whether port 443 and 80 are open for that IP or not.

Hello,
 
Thank you for your reply.
Could you please tell me your availability for today or Monday so that we can arrange a remote session to further investigate this matter? 
For the remote session you will need to have access to an affected computer as I would need to gather a set of logs.
 
Have a nice day,
