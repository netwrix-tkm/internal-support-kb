I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently working on implementing a regex for compliance with the LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) standards, but I am encountering issues with false positives. The current pattern is not as precise as needed, and I would like to request your assistance in refining it to ensure more accurate results.

Could you please provide guidance or a more effective regex solution that will help minimize false positives while ensuring compliance with LGPD requirements?

Regards,

Gabriel Jung","","we set up contextual detection for Brazilian ID, and we are waiting on the customer to test if it helps with the false positives","","we set up contextual detection for Brazilian ID, and we are waiting on the customer to test if it helps with the false positives","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Client Requests","","","27.4","Closed - Resolved","AIQON Servicos em Informatica LTDA - MSP","Gabriel Jung Gaia","2024-11-08T14:23:45.000Z","2024-12-05T23:02:24.000Z"
