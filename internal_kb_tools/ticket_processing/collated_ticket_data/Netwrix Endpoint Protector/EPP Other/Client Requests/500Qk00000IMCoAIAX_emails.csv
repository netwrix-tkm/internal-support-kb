I have received feedback from our R&D team and would like to relay to you their feedback.

Our R&D team prepared a test build with a fix for this issue. The problem was caused by an inconsistence between the threat count and the threats that were added to the threat list. Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

Please use the test build to check if the problem is fixed.  Please use the following link to download the test build: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp13032025/EPPMac3.0.4.0039.Notarized.tar

Important Note:
This test build is not meant for deployment in production environment.  It is meant to be tested on 2-3 endpoints only for the purpose to validate if the fix resolves the reported issue within your environment.

Hi Team,

 

I have reproduced the issue with test build 3.0.4.0024 and see that CAP report still show wrong count as same as before. The test scenario is exactly same as before:

- policy is block and report - Ignore threshold is OFF - file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers - content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20) - Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries

I also clicked the upload debug log from NEP agent.

 

Let me know if any

Linh

Hello Linh,

I hope you are well.

I would like to give you an update on this case.  We have tried to reproduce this issue on both Mac OS and Windows and could not successfully reproduce the issue.   Our R&D team have prepared a test build that will collect some additional logs in order to better understand what data we are sending to the server, and to compare the number displayed there with what is being sent. 

Can we please ask you to try and reproduce this again with the test build 3.0.4.0024 and provide us with a new set of logs?

Here is the download link for this build:

Hello Linh,

I trust you are well and Happy New Year to you.

There is a little bit of a delay on this case as most of the team is on winter holidays with the festive season. I have made a follow up on the internal case that is with our R&D team and they are currently investigating this case.  I will update you as soon as I have received internal feedback.

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file

Linh

Thank you!

Hello Linh,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Thank you for the follow up note.

Would you be able to take a recording of the entire CAP policy that you have created for the BLK_PHONE-VN_VN_SLACK into which you can show us all the exit points, all tabs for policy denylists, allowlists and also if you have created REGEXP or any Allowlists/Denylists that you've added, show us those as well and get back to us.

What I also recommend in the meantime, can you test with another file that has 20 different e-mail addreses and 20 different phone numbers?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Could you please show us the two regexp that you added so we can try to replicate exactly the issue?

Hello Linh,

Thank you for the follow up note.

Would you be able to take a recording of the entire CAP policy that you have created for the BLK_PHONE-VN_VN_SLACK into which you can show us all the exit points, all tabs for policy denylists, allowlists and also if you have created REGEXP or any Allowlists/Denylists that you've added, show us those as well and get back to us.

What I also recommend in the meantime, can you test with another file that has 20 different e-mail addreses and 20 different phone numbers?

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Hi Marian,

I think we already figured it out how the counting works here.
It only counts the unique matched data then ++1 for the rest duplicated.
For example, in the sample test file,
- there are 20 email records but all are one email -> unique 1 + 1 = 2
- there are 10 unique phone numbers -> unique 10 + 1 = 11
The problem is, look into the count number we do not know which data hit
the threshold, email or phone numbers.

Linh

First of all, I see that you have defined two Regex Denylists (one for phone numbers and one for email addresses).
That would definitely work, but I see that for Threat Threshold you let it 1, so that would block any mail address or phone number. For example, if you want to block 20 mails addresses or phone numbers, you should set the Threat Threshold: 20.

Secondly, please also note that EPP counts only unique threats (if the same phone number is found 4 times in the file, it will be counted only once).

In the attached screenshots, you can see that I tried to recreate your scenario with Threat Threshold: 2 and the threats (one phone number and one email address or just two phone numbers) were successfully blocked and counted.

Let us know if you have any additional questions.

Hi Marian,

 

I think we already figured it out how the counting works here. 

It only counts the unique matched data then ++1 for the rest duplicated. 

For example, in the sample test file, 

- there are 20 email records but all are one email -> unique 1 + 1 = 2

- there are 10 unique phone numbers -> unique 10 + 1 = 11

The problem is, look into the count number we do not know which data hit the threshold, email or phone numbers.

 

Regards

Linh

Hello Linh,

Thanks for getting back to me on this one.

I have reviewed the recording and it seems like you did not show the two REGEXP as per below:



Could you please show us the two regexp that you added so we can try to replicate exactly the issue?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for the follow up note.

Would you be able to take a recording of the entire CAP policy that you have created for the BLK_PHONE-VN_VN_SLACK into which you can show us all the exit points, all tabs for policy denylists, allowlists and also if you have created REGEXP or any Allowlists/Denylists that you've added, show us those as well and get back to us.

What I also recommend in the meantime, can you test with another file that has 20 different e-mail addreses and 20 different phone numbers?

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hi,

 

Ok, can you please explain how each pattern counted?

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Hi Oana,

First of all, the Global threat threshold supports up to 100 only while we
have use cases to use threshold up to 500 and more, that is the reason why
we use Individual threshold. In this ticket, I use an individual threshold
of 20
Individual threshold used in rule
[image: Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 09.10.08.png]
Global threshold support 1-100 only
[image: Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 09.11.08.png]
 for mail addresses or phone numbers. See screenshot below fyi
Second, I agree that EPP only counts unique threats, however it also plus 1
for the rest duplicated in the sum shown in CAP report. For example: in the
attached file, there are:
- 11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one, guess what, CAP
report showed 12 phone numbers counted.
- 4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated, guess what, CAP
report showed 5 mails counted.

In short, my test rule will detect and block if a file contains 20 phone
numbers or 20 email addresses. The test/sample file contains 17 phone
numbers (11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one) and 20
mail addresses (4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated). File
was hit by the rule and the content aware report showed 12 phone numbers
counted and 5 mails counted (see below).
[image: Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 09.30.49.png]
I have no problem with how EPP counts and shows on the content aware
report, I just don't understand how it works before.

Regards
Linh

Thank you for the clarification, that really helped us understand better this scenario.
I think that we can all agree that everything works as expected in this case (we have different ways to explain it, so from here a little confusion).
We have previously explained the rules and this is how the Threshold works as intended and as designed from the beginning.
Is there anything else that you would like to achieve?

Looking forward for your reply.

Hi Oana,

 

First of all, the Global threat threshold supports up to 100 only while we have use cases to use threshold up to 500 and more, that is the reason why we use Individual threshold. In this ticket, I use an individual threshold of 20

Individual threshold used in rule


 

Global threshold support 1-100 only

 for mail addresses or phone numbers. See screenshot below fyi

Second, I agree that EPP only counts unique threats, however it also plus 1 for the rest duplicated in the sum shown in CAP report. For example: in the attached file, there are:

- 11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one, guess what, CAP report showed 12 phone numbers counted.


- 4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated, guess what, CAP report showed 5 mails counted.

 

In short, my test rule will detect and block if a file contains 20 phone numbers or 20 email addresses. The test/sample file contains 17 phone numbers (11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one) and 20 mail addresses (4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated). File was hit by the rule and the content aware report showed 12 phone numbers counted and 5 mails counted (see below).



I have no problem with how EPP counts and shows on the content aware report, I just don't understand how it works before. 

 

Regards

Linh

Hello Linh,


First of all, I see that you have defined two Regex Denylists (one for phone numbers and one for email addresses).
That would definitely work, but I see that for Threat Threshold you let it 1, so that would block any mail address or phone number. For example, if you want to block 20 mails addresses or phone numbers, you should set the Threat Threshold: 20.

Secondly, please also note that EPP counts only unique threats (if the same phone number is found 4 times in the file, it will be counted only once).

In the attached screenshots, you can see that I tried to recreate your scenario with Threat Threshold: 2 and the threats (one phone number and one email address or just two phone numbers) were successfully blocked and counted.

Let us know if you have any additional questions.

Hi Marian,

 

I think we already figured it out how the counting works here. 

It only counts the unique matched data then ++1 for the rest duplicated. 

For example, in the sample test file, 

- there are 20 email records but all are one email -> unique 1 + 1 = 2

- there are 10 unique phone numbers -> unique 10 + 1 = 11

The problem is, look into the count number we do not know which data hit the threshold, email or phone numbers.

 

Regards

Linh

Hello Linh,

Thanks for getting back to me on this one.

I have reviewed the recording and it seems like you did not show the two REGEXP as per below:



Could you please show us the two regexp that you added so we can try to replicate exactly the issue?

Hello Linh,

Thank you for the follow up note.

Would you be able to take a recording of the entire CAP policy that you have created for the BLK_PHONE-VN_VN_SLACK into which you can show us all the exit points, all tabs for policy denylists, allowlists and also if you have created REGEXP or any Allowlists/Denylists that you've added, show us those as well and get back to us.

What I also recommend in the meantime, can you test with another file that has 20 different e-mail addreses and 20 different phone numbers?

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for getting back to me.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!

Hello Linh,

Thank you for the clarification, that really helped us understand better this scenario.
I think that we can all agree that everything works as expected in this case (we have different ways to explain it, so from here a little confusion).
We have previously explained the rules and this is how the Threshold works as intended and as designed from the beginning.
Is there anything else that you would like to achieve?

Looking forward for your reply.

Hi Oana,

 

First of all, the Global threat threshold supports up to 100 only while we have use cases to use threshold up to 500 and more, that is the reason why we use Individual threshold. In this ticket, I use an individual threshold of 20

Individual threshold used in rule


 

Global threshold support 1-100 only

 for mail addresses or phone numbers. See screenshot below fyi

Second, I agree that EPP only counts unique threats, however it also plus 1 for the rest duplicated in the sum shown in CAP report. For example: in the attached file, there are:

- 11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one, guess what, CAP report showed 12 phone numbers counted.


- 4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated, guess what, CAP report showed 5 mails counted.

 

In short, my test rule will detect and block if a file contains 20 phone numbers or 20 email addresses. The test/sample file contains 17 phone numbers (11 unique phone numbers and 5 of them are duplicated one) and 20 mail addresses (4 unique email addresses and 1 of them is duplicated). File was hit by the rule and the content aware report showed 12 phone numbers counted and 5 mails counted (see below).



I have no problem with how EPP counts and shows on the content aware report, I just don't understand how it works before. 

 

Regards

Linh

Hello Linh,


First of all, I see that you have defined two Regex Denylists (one for phone numbers and one for email addresses).
That would definitely work, but I see that for Threat Threshold you let it 1, so that would block any mail address or phone number. For example, if you want to block 20 mails addresses or phone numbers, you should set the Threat Threshold: 20.

Secondly, please also note that EPP counts only unique threats (if the same phone number is found 4 times in the file, it will be counted only once).

In the attached screenshots, you can see that I tried to recreate your scenario with Threat Threshold: 2 and the threats (one phone number and one email address or just two phone numbers) were successfully blocked and counted.

Let us know if you have any additional questions.

Hi Marian,

 

I think we already figured it out how the counting works here. 

It only counts the unique matched data then ++1 for the rest duplicated. 

For example, in the sample test file, 

- there are 20 email records but all are one email -> unique 1 + 1 = 2

- there are 10 unique phone numbers -> unique 10 + 1 = 11

The problem is, look into the count number we do not know which data hit the threshold, email or phone numbers.

 

Regards

Linh

Hello Linh,

Thank you for the follow up note.

Would you be able to take a recording of the entire CAP policy that you have created for the BLK_PHONE-VN_VN_SLACK into which you can show us all the exit points, all tabs for policy denylists, allowlists and also if you have created REGEXP or any Allowlists/Denylists that you've added, show us those as well and get back to us.

What I also recommend in the meantime, can you test with another file that has 20 different e-mail addreses and 20 different phone numbers?

Looking forward to your response.

Those two screenshots are not enough unfortunately as we need to check the CAP policy in it entirety  along with the denylists, allowlists and the rest of the settings, which is why I recommended the remote session for tomorrow.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for your patience in regards of this case.

I've took this internally to test out along with the test file that you have given us but we've got all sorts of different results and I believe this is due to the policies that we've tried.

I was wondering if it's ok to establish a quick remote session so we can take a look at your settings and understand better the case so we can test properly and come up with a better explanation.

Hello Linh,

Thank you for providing the testing document.

I've checked it and it seems like you have a lot of duplicate entries as it is shown below:



Not to mention the e-mail addresses, which makes sense for the EPP to detect so few entries.

If you recall what my colleague Andre mentioned in his mail where he provided the test build:

 Be aware that EPP counts only unique threats. This means that in order to have 20 threats reported, then 20 different threats should be in the test file.

 Therefore, please try to test again but make sure you have 20 different entries. If you have duplicate entries, they'll count only once.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I hope this message finds you well. I am following up in regards of the test built that was sent to you by my colleague Andre.

We would like to know if you had some time to test it out on 2-3 endpoints to see if the issue with the wrong count number is resolved.

As my colleague mentioned, this build is not meant for mass deployment, hence why we recommend to have it installed on 2-3 devices and then monitor the situation.

Looking forward to your response.

Hello Linh,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00427192. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00427192
Ticket Subject: CAP report shown the count number not correctly
Ticket Details: Hi team,

we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries.
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh

Thank you!
