They uses DPI and DPI Allowlist for the certain corporative webservers. The issue is: when customer try to open webpage (from DPI Allowlist), there are no any pop-ups for certificate choosing or something also. Now the web page uses Cososys Certificate that is not working. In result, a customer cannot access the web from the Allowlist. 
Now the customer has disabled the DPI feature, which affects to the security policy.
Note: Everything worked before, but at some point it stopped. There were no changes in the Netwrix EPP configuration.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-15T12:24:12.000Z"

As suggested to the customer, they will need to add the allowlist to at least one Content Aware Protection policy that also applies to the other users and let us know if the issue is resolved for all other users.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-20T14:13:06.000Z"

This case is now on awaiting client status, pending their feedback.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-20T14:14:03.000Z"
