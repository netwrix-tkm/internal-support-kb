I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently working on implementing a regex for compliance with the LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) standards, but I am encountering issues with false positives. The current pattern is not as precise as needed, and I would like to request your assistance in refining it to ensure more accurate results.

Could you please provide guidance or a more effective regex solution that will help minimize false positives while ensuring compliance with LGPD requirements?

Regards,

Gabriel Jung","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-08T14:23:46.000Z"
