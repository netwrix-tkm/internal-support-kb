The false positives are caused because REGEXes are not polished enough and unfortunately we can't offer support in their configuration.
I will check internally if we have any plans on improving detection of Brazilian PIIs and let you know next week.

It is possible to set up contextual detection, which will limit, but not get entirely rid of, false positives.
We can have a remote session to set this up if you're available.
