The PrivatBank customer is migrating to the new EPP instance, but with the migration via the SystemBackup v2 option, it does not transfer copies and logs.
The customer can allocate an S3 Bucket to temporary move logs and copies there.

Could you please schedule the remote session to migrate shadow copies and logs?

What would the best option here to not lose logs and shadow copies?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-25T13:58:09.000Z"
