Hello Simon,

For this situation, you can give an offline temporary password in order to allow the device in cause and the users will be able to access the devices without using encryption.
In order to create the offline temporary password you will have to access Offline Temporary Password -> Select the type of OTP -> Select the duration -> Select the device (or the device code) -> Select the computer (or user) -> Type a Justification and then click generate -> Once you generate the password you can send it to the user where the device should be allowed. Once the user enters the password in the EPP Client's notifier the device will be allowed for the specified amount of time.



Let me know if it helps.


Best regards,
Emil
