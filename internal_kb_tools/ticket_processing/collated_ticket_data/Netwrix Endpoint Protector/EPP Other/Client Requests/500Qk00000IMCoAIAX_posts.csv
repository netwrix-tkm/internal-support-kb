we have a CAP policy which is used Content detection rule threshold however the CAP report always shown wrong count number. For example:
- policy is block and report
- Ignore threshold is OFF
- file contains 20 emails and 16 phone numbers
- content detection rule threshold: email (20) OR phone (20)
- Sending file is blocked as expected however CAP report only shown count number is 18 and Matched Item shows 16 phone entries and 2 email entries
From my view, the count number must be 20 and matched item should be 20 email entries. 
Could you please explain the CAP report I reported here?
All relevant info in attached file
Regards
Linh","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-15T07:25:02.000Z"
