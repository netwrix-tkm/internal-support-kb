"500Qk00000KdjIAIAZ","00432215","Support Ticket","DPI Certificate","Hello! A customer reported the issue. They uses DPI and DPI Allowlist for the certain corporative webservers. The issue is: when customer try to open webpage (from DPI Allowlist), there are no any pop-ups for certificate choosing or something also. Now the web page uses Cososys Certificate that is not working. In result, a customer cannot access the web from the Allowlist. 
Now the customer has disabled the DPI feature, which affects to the security policy.
Note: Everything worked before, but at some point it stopped. There were no changes in the Netwrix EPP configuration.","","​​​​​​​In our remote session we noticed that the allowlist was not selected in any of the 24 Content Aware Protection policies which the customer are enforcing unto their endpoints.  After we added the DPI allowlist to one test CAP policy for the user in our call then the issue ""Certificate popup not appearing"" was resolved.  In our remote session we also upgraded one of the user's Windows EPP client from EPP version 6.2.3.1 to version 6.2.4.2.
As suggested to the customer, they will need to add the allowlist to at least one Content Aware Protection policy that also applies to the other users and let us know if the issue is resolved for all other users.","The customer will need to add the allowlist to at least one Content Aware Protection policy that also applies to the other users and let us know if the issue is resolved for all other users.
This case is now on awaiting client status, pending their feedback.","Hello!  The issue has been resolved. Thank you for the help! We can close the case.","","Andre Le Roux","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Client Requests","NONE","","12.0","Closed - Resolved","IPRO SIA","Elena Revzina","2025-01-15T12:24:12.000Z","2025-01-27T11:24:58.000Z"
