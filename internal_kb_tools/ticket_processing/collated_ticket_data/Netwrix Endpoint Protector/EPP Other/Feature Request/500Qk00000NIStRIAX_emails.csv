I was told that the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler.
We should try to install the latest EPP Client on a computer where Zscaler is installed and to investigate if the products will work together. If they will not work as expected, we should take a video of the issue and a set of logs in order to further investigate.
Please let me know if we can schedule a meeting for Wednesday or Thursday in order to investigate this.

Hi Emil,

Thanks for the update. When you say, ""the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler,"" does that mean ICAP integration is supported?

We are in a process of implementing the Zscaler CASB. EPP to Zscaler integration is in our road map for 2025. We are already having the latest version of the epp client. I will keep you posted when we are ready to test it.

Hi Emil,

 

Thanks for the update. When you say, ""the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler,"" does that mean ICAP integration is supported?

 

We are in a process of implementing the Zscaler CASB. EPP to Zscaler integration is in our road map for 2025. We are already having the latest version of the epp client. I will keep you posted when we are ready to test it.

 

 

 

Thanks

Arpitha

Hello Arpitha,

I was told that the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler.
We should try to install the latest EPP Client on a computer where Zscaler is installed and to investigate if the products will work together. If they will not work as expected, we should take a video of the issue and a set of logs in order to further investigate.
Please let me know if we can schedule a meeting for Wednesday or Thursday in order to investigate this.

Thank you,
Emil

Also, for DPI. I shall provide some dates later this week or early next week as we are in the change freeze window tiil 4th April.

Can you please let me know some more details regarding why do you need ICAP? This way, if it is really needed, I can open a feature request for it.

Hi Emil,

 

Thanks for the update. When you say, ""the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler,"" does that mean ICAP integration is supported?

 

We are in a process of implementing the Zscaler CASB. EPP to Zscaler integration is in our road map for 2025. We are already having the latest version of the epp client. I will keep you posted when we are ready to test it.

 

 

 

Thanks

Arpitha

Hello Arpitha,

I was told that the latest client from EPP Server v5941 should work with Zscaler.
We should try to install the latest EPP Client on a computer where Zscaler is installed and to investigate if the products will work together. If they will not work as expected, we should take a video of the issue and a set of logs in order to further investigate.
Please let me know if we can schedule a meeting for Wednesday or Thursday in order to investigate this.

Thank you,
Emil

Hi Emil,

ICAP integration is required between Zscaler CASB and CoSoSys Endpoint DLP to ensures the same DLP policies apply across endpoints and cloud traffic, preventing data leaks.

Hello Arpitha,

Regarding ICAP, we are not planning to implement ICAP support in the near future.
Can you please let me know some more details regarding why do you need ICAP? This way, if it is really needed, I can open a feature request for it.

Also, please let me know if we can have a remote session during the next week in order to test if Zscaler works well with the latest EPP Client.

Thank you,
Emil

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NIStR:ref

To summarise, ICAP integration is not supported today. Any idea, if it is part of the roadmap or any ETA?

Also, for DPI. I shall provide some dates later this week or early next week as we are in the change freeze window tiil 4th April.

Thanks
Arpitha

Hello Arpitha,

I asked again internally and I was told that it is not supported, but we should try DPI with the latest EPP client, as there have been improvements in our product as well as in the macOS operating system.
Please let me know when you have time for a remote session in order to test.

Thank you,
Emil
