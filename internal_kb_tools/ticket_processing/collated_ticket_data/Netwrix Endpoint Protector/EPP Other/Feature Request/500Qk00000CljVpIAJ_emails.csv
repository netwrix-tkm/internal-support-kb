Thank you for your email.
Can you please go to the EPP console, Dashboard-Live Update and click on ""View Applied EPP software Updates""and send a screenshot?
I think /hope that you applied the latest fix, hotfix 1.1 version.
If this is the case, I will check and send over the client download links as well.
You are correct, the clients were not included this time  on the UI to be able to update.
