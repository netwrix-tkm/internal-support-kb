I have received a reply to the ongoing feature request, but unfortunately I cannot reply back as the normal ticket has been closed for more than 30 days.
Please pass on the information:

Hello,

Thank you very much for your reply! 
If I understand correctly, this would probably involve renewing the self-signing certificate that is automatically generated by you.
I am really talking about a possibility that we can connect our own PKI there, e.g. through the ACME protocol interface to automatically update the SSL certificate valid for us internally every few years.
Nowadays people don't want to touch certificates and renew them manually.

It would be nice if it were possible to have our internal certificates (which I currently import manually into Endpoint Protector) renewed automatically

Many thanks and best regards
