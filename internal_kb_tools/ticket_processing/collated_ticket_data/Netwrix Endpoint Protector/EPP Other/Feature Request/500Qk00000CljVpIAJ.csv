"500Qk00000CljVpIAJ","00414254","Support Ticket","Seeking information related to the new update","Hello, this query is related to  ADV-2024-002. I have applied the newly released security patch/ hotfix on the EPP server but for the agents, it's showing the option to download the newly updated agents. Is there any way we can apply the new agent update from the dashboard as well as before from the 'Client Software Upgrade' option? For eg, the Agent version on the dashboard is 6.2.2.1 on windows, but on forum, it is 6.2.2.2005. Thanks","","","","Closing this case as Resolved  after confirming with the customer that the Hotfix  was applied successfully.
