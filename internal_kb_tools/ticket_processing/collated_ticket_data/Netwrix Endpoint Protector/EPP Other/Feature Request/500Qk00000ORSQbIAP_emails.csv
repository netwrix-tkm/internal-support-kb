I understand what you are trying to achieve.

As of right now I am investigating internally to see if there's a way to export the sub logs that you are requesting  under each CAP log.

I will get back to you and let you know what I found as soon as possible.

I am following up in regards of your inquiry related to the CAP reports.

I've checked the CAP reports options from under Reports and Analysis -> CAP Reports and in order for you to have the sub logs details(Items/Matched Items/Matched Types) and to not generate them for the entire list of computers, you can simply filter the logs first by using the below filter details:



After you filter the logs, please use the Create Export function->Select CSV or Excel:


Then click on View Export List. From there you will have the ability to download the logs.

Looking forward to your response.
