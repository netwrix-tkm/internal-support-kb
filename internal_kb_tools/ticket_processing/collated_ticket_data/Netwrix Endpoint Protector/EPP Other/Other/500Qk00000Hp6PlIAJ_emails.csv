Hi,
We do not have SSL termination as far as I know.
We created a rule that allows TCP communication on port 443 from the AVD machines to the server, with the destination being the server’s URL.
However the AVD machines are still not communicating with the server. Is it possible to somehow get oir hosted servers IP address and not URL?

Thanks

Hello,

The port used for communication between client and server is port 443.
Also, please make sure there is no ssl termination on the port in the AVD firewall.
You can also open the Epp client window, click on the settings tab, and press ctrl + alt + i to see if the IP is present and correct.

Kind regards

Hi,
I have an update on this.
I have opened the FW to allow communication between the AVD machines and the dlp server on 443.
I have also had the client software installed via intune.
However the AVD machines are not present within the serve – only endpoint I see is my own endpoint on which I have installed the agent myself.
How do I rectify this?

thanks

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Hp6Pl:ref


Hi,
We do not have SSL termination as far as I know.
We created a rule that allows TCP communication on port 443 from the AVD machines to the server, with the destination being the server’s URL.
However the AVD machines are still not communicating with the server. Is it possible to somehow get oir hosted servers IP address and not URL?

Thanks

Hello,

The port used for communication between client and server is port 443.
Also, please make sure there is no ssl termination on the port in the AVD firewall.
You can also open the Epp client window, click on the settings tab, and press ctrl + alt + i to see if the IP is present and correct.

Kind regards

Hi,

I have an update on this.

I have opened the FW to allow communication between the AVD machines and the dlp server on 443.

I have also had the client software installed via intune.

However the AVD machines are not present within the serve – only endpoint I see is my own endpoint on which I have installed the agent myself.

How do I rectify this?

 

thanks

We do not have SSL termination as far as I know.

We created a rule that allows TCP communication on port 443 from the AVD machines to the server, with the destination being the server’s URL.

However the AVD machines are still not communicating with the server. Is it possible to somehow get oir hosted servers IP address and not URL?

 

Thanks

Hello,

The port used for communication between client and server is port 443.
Also, please make sure there is no ssl termination on the port in the AVD firewall.
You can also open the Epp client window, click on the settings tab, and press ctrl + alt + i to see if the IP is present and correct.

Kind regards

When looking at the client,
The last server connection section is empty.
What do you mean by “checking the epp server window?”
I can try to install locally, but that means first to uninstall the client currently installed via intune – how do I go about doing this?
If possible, could we perhaps have a call in order to do all this?

Then checking the Epp seerver window does it show the domain?
Can you try to install the Epp client manually on a AVD machine to see if it communicates?

Hi,
I have an update on this.
I have opened the FW to allow communication between the AVD machines and the dlp server on 443.
I have also had the client software installed via intune.
However the AVD machines are not present within the serve – only endpoint I see is my own endpoint on which I have installed the agent myself.
How do I rectify this?

thanks
