@WaitingOnEngineer
Hello,
There seems to be an issue, DPI feature cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.
To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file needs to be created:
sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log

Then the issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log file collected and sent to us for investigation.

Thank you

Hello,
There seems to be a problem when initializing DPI. Could be a crash.

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in /etc/security/limits.conf: root soft core unlimited
A restart is required for this to take effect.
Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.
Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting j.log file): journalctl --system > j.log

Thank you

Hello,
There are installed and running on the system some packages that might interfere with EPP.
These are FortiClient, Wazuh and Scrut.
It would be helpful to know if EPP runs correctly if these packages are not installed.

A follow up on the last response.
They say that after upgrading DLP they faced this issue. But did they also upgrade any of the other clients?
Because Forticlient has SSL Inspection, it can clash with EPP.
Forticlient also has Application Access control which can kill our proxy process. Is there something like this in Forticlient's logs?

In addition to the previous questions the customer can try to run our proxy command that seems to be stopping.
It might be useful to run it multiple times if it stops quickly and see if it generates any error message.
The command is: sudo /opt/cososys/sbin/epp_sslsplit -D -i -u root -k /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/key.pem -c /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/cert.pem -N /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json http 127.0.0.1 27080 netfilter https 127.0.0.1 27443 netfilter ssl 127.0.0.1 27445 netfilter tcp 127.0.0.1 27444 netfilter

Please see the questions that we asked the customer and also their response below.
The result of the proxy command is in the screenshot located ion the attachments folder.


SUPPORT:
Also follow up on your previous response,  you said that after upgrading DLP you faced this issue. 
Did you also upgrade any of the other clients?  Because Forticlient has SSL Inspection, it can clash with EPP.  
Forticlient also has Application Access control which can kill our proxy process. Is there something like this in Forticlient's logs?
Did you also upgrade Forticlient in the upgrade process? Is there something in Forticlient's logs that suggests it's interfering with EPP?

We upgraded the DLP version for all users ( almost 100 users) and so far 10 users raised the same issue. We only upgraded DLP.","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-12-04T16:38:05.000Z","2024-12-04T16:38:05.000Z","false","false"

The build as discussed in the remote session is available at: //192.168.14.5/public/groups/_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2024-builds/2024_12_06/EPPLinux_v2.4.4.1002/EPPClient_ubuntu_20.04_v2.4.4.1002_x86_64.tar.gz

Also, the debug steps.
Stop the epp service: 

--- CODE ---
systemctl stop epp-client-daemon.timer && systemctl stop epp-client-daemon.service
--- CODE ---

Edit options.ini and add netdlp.debug=1 (with an editor of your choosing):

--- CODE ---
sudo vim /opt/cososys/share/apps/epp-client/options.ini
#add 'netdlp.debug=1' on a new line
--- CODE ---

Restart epp service:

--- CODE ---
systemctl restart epp-client-daemon.service
--- CODE ---

Wait for issue to reproduce.
In the epp logs there will be a line that shows how the epp_sslsplit proxy is started, something like:

--- CODE ---
13:00:19.804 77fff INFO   starting process: '""/opt/cososys/sbin/epp_sslsplit"" -D -i -u root -k /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/key.pem -c /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/cert.pem -N /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json http 127.0.0.1 27080 netfilter https 127.0.0.1 27443 netfilter ssl 127.0.0.1 27445 netfilter tcp 127.0.0.1 27444 netfilter' [base/NetdlpActivator.cpp:777 start_proxy_process]
--- CODE ---

And a line that shows that it was terminated, similar to the following:

--- CODE ---
13:00:20.980 767fc WARN   netdlp termination detected (9), activation: 1, deactivation: 0 [base/NetDlpEventQueue.cpp:231 netdlp_monitor]
--- CODE ---

Now start the proxy in a terminal and capture the output, also the exit code (with echo $?):

--- CODE ---
sudo /opt/cososys/sbin/epp_sslsplit -D -i -u root -k /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/key.pem -c /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/cert.pem -N /var/opt/cososys/epp-client/netdlp/netdlp_settings.json http 127.0.0.1 27080 netfilter https 127.0.0.1 27443 netfilter ssl 127.0.0.1 27445 netfilter tcp 127.0.0.1 27444 netfilter ; echo $?
--- CODE ---

If it doesn't terminate immediately that means that it's working as expected, use the computer as normal until the problem starts reproducing.


If it is terminates quickly that means that the problem is reproducing, run it a few more times (let's say 5-10 times) if it still terminates quickly, and then collect the logs.

Please provide epp_client_daemon.log, eppsslsplit.log, and the output of the commands.

To restore epp to normal, please reinstall.

Hello.
Unfortunately this video does not help us. We have no new information from the video.
Did they also try the new build?

The only thing I can think of to try next is to reproduce their environment on a virtual machine and hopefully reproduce the issue.
If they are willing to do this I will need some instructions on how to setup my machine similar to theirs.
