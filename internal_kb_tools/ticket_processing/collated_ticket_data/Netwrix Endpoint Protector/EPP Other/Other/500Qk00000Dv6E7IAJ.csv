We are encountering an issue in the DLP portal where password expired pop-ups are appearing. When we attempt to change the password in the DLP web portal, we receive the error message ""The password provided is different from the existing password,"" despite entering the correct password.

Could you please assist us in resolving this issue?

Thanks & Regards,
