for the SIEM integration, I enabled syslog-ng from the backend and now he customer will reach out to Wazuh support to see what changes are needed
also started the server upgrade process since they were on 5.8.1.0
the customer will let me know if there are any issues after the upgrades are installed.","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2024-06-26T15:54:44.000Z","2024-06-26T15:54:44.000Z","false","false"

check for duplicates
check the cron:
       cd /EPPServer/appliance/dashboardData/                ll
if all fails, there is an ADO opened for improvements to the dashboard 343733","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2024-07-01T20:34:07.000Z","2024-07-01T20:34:07.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007qVWkIAM","500Qk00000CH9rEIAT","the customer does not have a valid license and I cannot troubleshoot their issue.
they will reach out to their account manager and will get back once they resolve it.
I saw that they have Linux policies but no logs were ever present in the console.
need to enable DPI and check again if any logs are generated
Also, the SIEM might not be configured correctly","005Qk000001nViBIAU","2024-07-10T15:43:41.000Z","2024-07-12T15:27:52.000Z","false","false"
