We are currently attempting to apply backend updates but are encountering recurring issues. The updates fail to progress and remain stuck at the ""applying update"" stage.
This issue appears to be similar to a previous incident we reported under ticket ID 00420100.

Could you please assist us in resolving this matter?

Thank you,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-04T14:19:23.000Z"
