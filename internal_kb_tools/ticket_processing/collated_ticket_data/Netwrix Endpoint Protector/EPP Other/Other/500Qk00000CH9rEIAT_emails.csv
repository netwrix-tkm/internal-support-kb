Good morning

Cordial greetings, currently the DLP is presenting some inconsistencies 
in the report of the users where the agent is installed and in other 
equipment that is installed does not report and is not shown in the 
panel. In addition, the connection with the SIEM tool is not evident, 
since it is not reporting information either.

As proof, the following is attached

  * DLP no report




  * Connection with Wuazuh, which is the SIEM tool.




  * All options are activated and still not sending information to SIEM.




  * DLP listening configuration





  * No DLP report evidenced

I think it would be best to set up a remote session and check what is happening as I think it is just a configuration issue.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability and I will set it up?

Hi Juan,

I think it would be best to set up a remote session and check what is happening as I think it is just a configuration issue.
Can you please let me know your timezone and availability and I will set it up?
Also, I might need SSH access to the server so please make sure we are able to connect.

Thank you,

Hi Juan,

Could you please provide more details as to what logs are not present and what is wrong with the SIEM integration?
The attachments got lost along the way as they were not attached, so can you please re-add them?

Unfortunately, we currently do not have a Spanish-speaking support technician. We will manage using Google Translate if need be.
One thing I need before the meeting is for you to create a snapshot of the VM, and make sure we have SSH access in case it is needed.
The meting is set for today at 3 PM Bogota time. here is the link: https://endpointprotector.zoom.us/j/88661388497
