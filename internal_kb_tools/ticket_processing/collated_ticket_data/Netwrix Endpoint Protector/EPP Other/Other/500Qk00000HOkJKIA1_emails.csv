Hi Botond,

What is required for the firewall rule to allow the off-network machines to update policy? Do you have documentation on this process that you could share with me please?

Thanks,
Matt

Hi Matt, Thanks for reaching out! If your EPP server is online, the agents will communicate with it. If you have a rule in the firewall to only accept connections from the network in the U. S. , they won’t communicate, and a VPN is needed

I double checked, and the only way for those agents in Hong Kong to communicate with the server is for the server to be connected to the internet and to have an associated FQDN. The EPP clients need to be installed with that FQDN as the server address.
