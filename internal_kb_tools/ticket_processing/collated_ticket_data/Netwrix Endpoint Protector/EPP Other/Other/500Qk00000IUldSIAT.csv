We are requesting your assistance in providing answers to the following questions related to Bank Aladin's assessment:

1. Is there an RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for the Cloud-hosted EPP server specific to the Bank Aladin tenant? If so, could you please specify the duration for both RPO and RTO?

2. Could you confirm the details of the Database Management System currently in use, including the version number? We understand that mySQL is used and would appreciate the specific version information.

Thank you.
