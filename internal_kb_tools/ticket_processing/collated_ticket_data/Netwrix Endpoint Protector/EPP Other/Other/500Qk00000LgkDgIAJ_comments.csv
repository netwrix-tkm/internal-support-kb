Hi,

After investigation, we found that this is not a bug. Only on the Deep Packet Inspection Predefined Ports UI, the 587 port is set to HTTP instead of SMTP.

The functionality is not affected by this UI issue, and everything works as expected.

Also, a ticket will be raised to change the Deep Packet Inspection - Predefined Ports section, from HTTP 587 to SMTP.
