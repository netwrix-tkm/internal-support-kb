1.Printers content based not blocking ( Content Aware Policy)

Here printer is selected in policy and “Advanced Printer and MTP Scanning” setting is enabled. Also, we reboot the system, but result was same.


2.Content Aware Reports Logs suddenly stopped generating. Blocking is working and notification at client’s side is also working. Check attached image for reference.

Customer current version is 5.9.3.0. Please check attached image for applied updates.

3.Linux content aware policy is not working. Agent is showing online. Last connection is also available in client. But policy is not working for content aware protection.
We tested usb blocking and whitelisting a specific usb in Device control for Linux Machine and it worked successfully. But when tried any policy in Content Aware policy we didn’t succeed. Also , CAP policy is active and is applied to Linux Machine. it is selected on Include policy. Ubuntu version :- 22.04.Client installed 22.04. Please check below agent link.
