I have asked our colleagues from the devops team to grant us access on your EPP server and also reboot it.

Hi Jared,

Please try again now and let me know if it works, also if it still doesn't work, I can try a reboot of the server if that is okay with you.

Thank you,

Hey Jared,

They wouldn't let go of the best technician from their team :-)
Please try again and let me know if you can access the console.
There are still some logs to be deleted, which should be processed, but I will also ask internally to be sure.

Hello again, Eduard! I hope you are doing well. I’m glad to see that you are still on the support team even after the Netwrix acquisition! 

 

Of course you may have permission to access the server! Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

We are still looking into this issue with our colleagues from the devops team. It seems that initially there were a lot of deleted logs and files that were no longer needed and we deleted them. Currently we are looking into the performance and optimization of the EPP server.

Can you please let us know approximately how many computers you currently have connected to the EPP server?

Hi Jared,

Please try again now and let me know if it works, also if it still doesn't work, I can try a reboot of the server if that is okay with you.

Thank you,

Hey Jared,

They wouldn't let go of the best technician from their team :-)
Please try again and let me know if you can access the console.
There are still some logs to be deleted, which should be processed, but I will also ask internally to be sure.

Thank you,

Hello again, Eduard! I hope you are doing well. I’m glad to see that you are still on the support team even after the Netwrix acquisition! 

 

Of course you may have permission to access the server! Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Hi Jared,

Can you please allow me to request access to your server and log into it, in your absence, so that I can check out what is happening?
