Just it will not notify us until we refresh the page. I won't capture setting changes and will happen while actively navigating around. 

We have been migrating this by using Edge, which seems to hold the session open and be fine.

Any assistance for this would be great, thank you for your time and consideration.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-11T13:47:42.000Z"
