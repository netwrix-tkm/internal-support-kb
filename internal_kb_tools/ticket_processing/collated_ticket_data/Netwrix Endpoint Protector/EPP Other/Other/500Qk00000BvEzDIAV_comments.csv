I have a follow-up comment. The duplicated reported events (sharedstrings.xml related, from the first screenshot) were fixed and the fix will be in the upcoming 5940 patch.

I think there is an explanation for each of the two screenshots. 

For one of them, as one can see, the threat reported is probably the same (even though we can't see it entirely, since it is obfuscated), but it is reported from different files (sharedstrings.xml and sheet12.xml). We are aware of this limitation. There is at least another ADO entry related to this and probably we will try to handle it in the future. The explanation is simple. That information is kept in two different xmls (I was expecting not to have it in sheetXX.xml as long as it is in sharedStrings.xml, but it seems it is not always like this). So, in this case EPP could only try to ignore the info in one of the xmls, as long as it is in both. 

As for the second screenshot, I can see that the reported file is exactly the same. In that case, I suspect that the reported threat is not the same. We can’t say this exactly because the threat is obfuscated. If the customer has access to that file, this could be checked/tested. I think that’s pretty much all we can say from these screenshots.
