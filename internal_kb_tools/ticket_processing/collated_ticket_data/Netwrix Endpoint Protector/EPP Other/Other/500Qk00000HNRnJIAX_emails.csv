Hi Anil,

The allocation of the licenses is made automatically and the reason for this is in order not to use the licenses on more systems than the number of licenses.
If you want to allocate the licenses to a specific group - you first need to make sure that you have enough free licenses (400  in your case).
If licenses are not available you first need to uninstall the clients from the computers which you want to decommission, obtain the number of free licenses that you need and only then install the client on the group of computers where you want to redirect the available licenses.
