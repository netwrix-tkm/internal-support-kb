Thank you for your time today.
As discussed, please see the steps on how to generate log files below:

1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4. Select ""Create Log File"" and click ""Execute"" then select ""Create DPI Log File"" and click ""Execute"". This creates files in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Reproduce the scenario (please also let us know which were the scenarios you performed - example1: Screenshot-01 taken on the PDF file - attach the screenshot-01 to the ticket - and wanted to paste it in the Gmail Email Body - add the pop-up information message; example 2:  ... - pasted to a file upload site; example 3: etc. )
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

I'm not sure why my messages would not be reaching you, so here is another attempt. I also looped in @Mesut Gungor.

 

I repeated the requested steps for each example and attached the logs again to this email.

Hi Alin, 
 

I tried responding to your emails three times already with the requested logs attached.



 

I'm not sure why my messages would not be reaching you, so here is another attempt. I also looped in @Mesut Gungor.

 

I repeated the requested steps for each example and attached the logs again to this email. 

 

Best,

Kevin
