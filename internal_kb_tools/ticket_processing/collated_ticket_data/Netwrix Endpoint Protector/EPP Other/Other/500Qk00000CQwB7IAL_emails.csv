There is no known issue regarding the logs that might be caused by the vulnerability patch.
If they did not upgrade the agent to the fixed version, please ask them to do that and see if the logs are still not received on the server. If they did upgrade, then we need a set of logs, for which we can set up a remote session, or if you want, you can gather them and send them my way and I will involve engineering.
Just a regular trigger of a threat that does not have logs on the server, with a screenshot from reports and analysis.
Here are the links to the agents for Win and Mac, if you need them for Linux, let me know which version.

Can you please check with the customer and provide the following details?:
what is the server version?

Hi Lucas,

There is no known issue regarding the logs that might be caused by the vulnerability patch.
If they did not upgrade the agent to the fixed version, please ask them to do that and see if the logs are still not received on the server. If they did upgrade, then we need a set of logs, for which we can set up a remote session, or if you want, you can gather them and send them my way and I will involve engineering.
Just a regular trigger of a threat that does not have logs on the server, with a screenshot from reports and analysis.
Here are the links to the agents for Win and Mac, if you need them for Linux, let me know which version.

Hi Lucas,

There is no known issue regarding the logs that might be caused by the vulnerability patch.
If they did not upgrade the agent to the fixed version, please ask them to do that and see if the logs are still not received on the server. If they did upgrade, then we need a set of logs, for which we can set up a remote session, or if you want, you can gather them and send them my way and I will involve engineering.
Just a regular trigger of a threat that does not have logs on the server, with a screenshot from reports and analysis.
Here are the links to the agents for Win and Mac, if you need them for Linux, let me know which version.
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut

Hey Lucas,

Can you please check with the customer and provide the following details?:
what is the server version?
how is the environment hosted (onprem/AWS/GCP/AZURE)?
how was the patch applied?
which version of the client was used to reproduce the issue?
were clients rebooted after the install/upgrade?

Also if possible a set of logs triggering a policy that does not appear in the console.

Thank you,

Hi Lucas,

There is no known issue regarding the logs that might be caused by the vulnerability patch.
If they did not upgrade the agent to the fixed version, please ask them to do that and see if the logs are still not received on the server. If they did upgrade, then we need a set of logs, for which we can set up a remote session, or if you want, you can gather them and send them my way and I will involve engineering.
Just a regular trigger of a threat that does not have logs on the server, with a screenshot from reports and analysis.
Here are the links to the agents for Win and Mac, if you need them for Linux, let me know which version.
MacOS: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPMac3.0.2.2005.Notarized.tar
Windows: https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/EppClientVulnerability/EPPClient_v6.2.2.2005.zip

Let me know how you want to proceed.
