Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked the UI and backend settings after the Super admin account was re-created and they looked okay now. We also enabled 2FA for the account.

Hi Bryan,

Thank you for the remote session!

As we spoke we checked the UI and backend settings after the Super admin account was re-created and they looked okay now. We also enabled 2FA for the account.

We will leave this ticket open for about 1 week to make sure that the issue does not come back.
