We have configured the file blocking policy for the encrypted file type from uploading or sending from the computer machine. The policy is working but we found that it was not blocking the Encrypted PDF file which is unexpected behavior.

Kindly help us to resolve this issue as we are not able to identify the main cause of the problem.

Regards,
Shivendra","","","","The cust confirmed the closure","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","26.1","Closed - Resolved","Seamless Infotech Pvt. Ltd.","Amarpreet Singh","2024-08-14T07:19:24.000Z","2024-09-09T10:04:00.000Z"
