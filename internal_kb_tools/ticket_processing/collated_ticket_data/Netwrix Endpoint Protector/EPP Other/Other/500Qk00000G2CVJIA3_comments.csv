@WaitingOnEngineer this is probably a false positive detection from Microsoft Defender.

CVE-2012-2994 is the EPP appliance vulnerability that it comes by default with a hard-coded root password. The EPP agent does not have anything to do with this. The customer can report this false-positive detection to Microsoft.
