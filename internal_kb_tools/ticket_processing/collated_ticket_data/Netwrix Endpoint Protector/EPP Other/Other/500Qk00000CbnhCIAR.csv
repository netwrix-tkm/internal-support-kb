Treasury are planning to do our V2 Backup and Migration from an older model server to a newer one, and we are looking to get some support in train for the night of the Change, just in case anything goes wrong.

We will also be upgrading from 9.6.1 to 9.6.3 and applying the hotfix.

Upgrade/Change planned for the 10th or 11th July 2024, 1900 AEST.

Kind Regards,
Finn Ruth-Duffy","","","","Customer confirmed we can close the ticket.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","104.0","Closed - Resolved","Queensland Treasury","Finn Ruth-Duffy","2024-07-03T04:43:05.000Z","2024-10-15T04:49:08.000Z"
