Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Nothing is working. Installation got failed every time.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Dear Netwrix team,

We are only on the stage of deployment of EPP.

Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way.

As the Intune is a supported way of deployment via the endpoints. We would like to utilize this feature.

It is not an upgrade, it is a clean install on a new endpoints.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Daniel, hello.
Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.
Please find attached log from manual install.
As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.
[cid:b799c50c-849f-4311-928c-37ab7f720d2e]

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.
Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.
So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.

Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

 

Please find attached log from manual install.

As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.



 

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.

""Product: Endpoint Protector -- Error 1904. Module C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protectori386EPPMailChecker.dll failed to register.  HRESULT -1073741819.  Contact your support personnel.""

Can you please uninstall the client and then reinstall it with the below command line :

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Please share the EPP_inst.log file once the install is finished. 

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Dear Netwrix team,

We are only on the stage of deployment of EPP.

Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way.

As the Intune is a supported way of deployment via the endpoints. We would like to utilize this feature.

It is not an upgrade, it is a clean install on a new endpoints.

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Daniel, hello.

Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

 

Please find attached log from manual install.

As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.



 

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.

Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.

So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Daniel, hello.

Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

 

Please find attached log from manual install.

As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.



 

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.

Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.

So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Looking forward for your response.

Dear support team,

Yes, machine was restarted several times. Also tried on the fresh machine just imaged without previously installed EPP.

Each time after downloading the app from the Company Portal after installation it got failed.

Already tried several times, machines and even try to pack the app into IntuneWin format (intune compatible files)

Nothing is working. Installation got failed every time.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Dear Netwrix team,

We are only on the stage of deployment of EPP.

Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way.

As the Intune is a supported way of deployment via the endpoints. We would like to utilize this feature.

It is not an upgrade, it is a clean install on a new endpoints.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000OGQyP:ref

Daniel, hello.
Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

Please find attached log from manual install.
As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.
[cid:dbae712a-a5e2-435e-9ac5-433133dc6eb5@Image_0_]

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.
Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.
So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.
Best regards,
Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have installed the EPP client manually and when we tried it from the Intune solution we received the following error :

""Product: Endpoint Protector -- Error 1904. Module C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protectori386EPPMailChecker.dll failed to register.  HRESULT -1073741819.  Contact your support personnel.""

Can you please uninstall the client and then reinstall it with the below command line :

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Please share the EPP_inst.log file once the install is finished.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Daniel, hello.

Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

 

Please find attached log from manual install.

As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.



 

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.

Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.

So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have installed the EPP client manually and when we tried it from the Intune solution we received the following error :

""Product: Endpoint Protector -- Error 1904. Module C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protectori386EPPMailChecker.dll failed to register.  HRESULT -1073741819.  Contact your support personnel.""

Can you please uninstall the client and then reinstall it with the below command line :

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Please share the EPP_inst.log file once the install is finished. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Dear Netwrix team,

We are only on the stage of deployment of EPP.

Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way.

As the Intune is a supported way of deployment via the endpoints. We would like to utilize this feature.

It is not an upgrade, it is a clean install on a new endpoints.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Daniel, hello.
Hope you are doing well.
I have a great news for you.
It finally got installed with no issues!
Looks like the correct one for Intune is this one:

WSIP=""Server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" DEPARTMENT_CODE=""defdef"" INSTALL_NOTES_EXT=""0"" INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=""0"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress
The one that you send contains additional spaces that prevent proper installation for some reason.

Many thanks for your follow up and efforts and continuous support, truly appreciate it!
Best regards,
Evgeny

Dear Evgeny,

You mentioned that ""Previously it was installed manually on the machine, but this one is not the way."" - can you please confirm if you restarted the computer after uninstalling the agent and prior to pushing the eppclient install from Intune? If not, can you please try to reboot the machine and try again? Also can you try to push the client installation from Intune on a computer that did not had the agent installed before?

Looking forward for your reply.

Hello Evgeny,

Can you please let us know from what version of client you try to upgrade to which version and also if this is happening only for those 3 machines? Did others upgraded OK?
Also, would it be possible to connect to one of the affected systems in order to try a manual upgrade of the client by installing the newer version on top and see if any errors are encountered?

You can do this from the command line by running the following:

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Daniel, hello.

Hope you are doing well.

I have a great news for you.

It finally got installed with no issues!

Looks like the correct one for Intune is this one:

 

WSIP=""Server_IP"" WSPORT=""443"" DEPARTMENT_CODE=""defdef"" INSTALL_NOTES_EXT=""0"" INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=""0"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress

 

The one that you send contains additional spaces that prevent proper installation for some reason.

 

Many thanks for your follow up and efforts and continuous support, truly appreciate it!

Best regards,

Evgeny

Daniel, hello.

You want me to add this to Intune config?

WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" DEPARTMENT_CODE=""defdep""  INSTALL_NOTES_EXT=""0"" INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=""0"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress 

As the msiexec.exe looks like cmd installation, not an Intune based one.

I will check and update you accordingly.

Hello Evgeny,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have uninstalled the client and install an old version for which we received the error 1603. We have saved the install.log and repeat the step to install the latest client 6.2.4.2 .

Could you please uninstall the EPP using the attached zap tool, restart the endpoint and then please add the below expression as a parameter for the new install ? 
!!!Please note that this is an internal tool, provided to customers just in extraordinary situations. Please confirm that you will only use it as administrator and you will delete it from each machine after having used it and also that you will not share the tool with any third party.

msiexec.exe /i ""C:EPPClientSetup.5.7.0.3_x86_64.msi"" WSIP=""192.168.7.108"" WSPORT=""443"" DEPARTMENT_CODE=""defdep""  INSTALL_NOTES_EXT=""0"" INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=""0"" /q REBOOT=ReallySuppress 

Please let us know if the situation persist . 

Looking forward for your response.

Daniel, hello.

Manual installation goes well as always. The main thing is with Intune installation.

 

Please find attached log from manual install.

As per my understanding, it looks like Intune reads MSI file incorrectly, even if we put no addons while downloading MSI from the server. We get an error that you mentioned, that some MailChecker failed to register.



 

Intune while install for some reason see the adding's, which is not correct interpretation of MSI.

Meanwhile Windows is able to install without any errors.

So my guess will be incorrect MSI coding for Intune.

Best regards,

Evgeny

Hello Evgeny,

Thank you for your time in today's session. 

In the meeting we have installed the EPP client manually and when we tried it from the Intune solution we received the following error :

""Product: Endpoint Protector -- Error 1904. Module C:Program FilesCoSoSysEndpoint Protectori386EPPMailChecker.dll failed to register.  HRESULT -1073741819.  Contact your support personnel.""

Can you please uninstall the client and then reinstall it with the below command line :

msiexec.exe /i ""EPPClientSetup.5.6.1.1_x86_64.msi"" /qn /l*v ""c:tempEPP_inst.log"" WSIP=ip WSPORT=443

In the above, the msi path needs to be specified by you along with the name of the msi that you are using.

c:tempEPP_inst.log will show if there are any issues.

Please share the EPP_inst.log file once the install is finished. 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,
