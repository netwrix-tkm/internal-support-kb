Hi
It still doesn't appear that we have access to the DFAT EEP product to download new versions, etc and access license keys.  Is this a feature of the support portal?  When I go to the My Products tab nothing is listed.

Thanks

Hi
We would like to be able to download the latest versions and updates of EPP.  Our system is air-gapped so we require a means to save the software so that we can transfer it to our systems.
When I log on to the portal and click on ""My Products"" all I see is ""You are not enjoying the benefits of Netwrix products yet.""

Thanks

Hi
It still doesn't appear that we have access to the DFAT EEP product to download new versions, etc and access license keys.  Is this a feature of the support portal?  When I go to the My Products tab nothing is listed.

Thanks
Hugh

Hi

We would like to be able to download the latest versions and updates of EPP.  Our system is air-gapped so we require a means to save the software so that we can transfer it to our systems.  

When I log on to the portal and click on “My Products” all I see is “You are not enjoying the benefits of Netwrix products yet.”

 

Thanks

Hugh

Hi Andrei,

Yes that's correct on the old server I can see the licences.  But there doesn't appear to be a way to export the licence to put it on the new server.

Can you send some documentation how to do this or send the licence file to put on the new server.  Once the new server is licenced the old will be decommissioned.

Hi
We would like to be able to download the latest versions and updates of EPP.  Our system is air-gapped so we require a means to save the software so that we can transfer it to our systems.

To do this you can migrate the data from the old to the new one using System Backup v2.
You can try the steps below.
3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.



Kind regards

Hi Andrei,


Thank you for the instruction how to upgrade the server.

The version of the current Server is 5.4.0.  Can you please supply the offline patches to get the server up to version 5.8.

Hello,

To do this you can migrate the data from the old to the new one using System Backup v2.
You can try the steps below.
3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

Hi Andrei,

Yes that's correct on the old server I can see the licences.  But there doesn't appear to be a way to export the licence to put it on the new server.

Can you send some documentation how to do this or send the licence file to put on the new server.  Once the new server is licenced the old will be decommissioned.

Hi
We would like to be able to download the latest versions and updates of EPP.  Our system is air-gapped so we require a means to save the software so that we can transfer it to our systems.
When I log on to the portal and click on ""My Products"" all I see is ""You are not enjoying the benefits of Netwrix products yet.""

Thanks

Hi
It still doesn't appear that we have access to the DFAT EEP product to download new versions, etc and access license keys.  Is this a feature of the support portal?  When I go to the My Products tab nothing is listed.

Thanks

Hi

We would like to be able to download the latest versions and updates of EPP.  Our system is air-gapped so we require a means to save the software so that we can transfer it to our systems.  

When I log on to the portal and click on “My Products” all I see is “You are not enjoying the benefits of Netwrix products yet.”

 

Thanks

Hugh

Hello,

To be clear you needed the license file for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?

Kind regards

Hi

It still doesn’t appear that we have access to the DFAT EEP product to download new versions, etc and access license keys.  Is this a feature of the support portal?  When I go to the My Products tab nothing is listed.

 

Thanks

Hugh
