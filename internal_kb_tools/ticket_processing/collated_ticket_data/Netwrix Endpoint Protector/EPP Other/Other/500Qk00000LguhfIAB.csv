In your ticketing platform is missing latest Server Version. Ticketing is 5.9.4.0, server version is 5.9.4.1.

You should update this section.

Thanks","","Client reported to us that currently, on the netwrix support portal, we are still using 5.9.4.0 version instead of 5.9.4.1 and he is wondering when we will update the portal.","Will have to update the client that we are aware of it and our team is working on this update implementation.","Informed management about the missing the latest version.
They'll take a look further.","","Marian Ilies","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","14.0","Closed - Resolved","Regina Maria","Cristian Voicu","2025-02-10T12:59:28.000Z","2025-02-24T12:39:01.000Z"
