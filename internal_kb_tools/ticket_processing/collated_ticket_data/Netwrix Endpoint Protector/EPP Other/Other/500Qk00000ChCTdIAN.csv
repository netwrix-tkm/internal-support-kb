"500Qk00000ChCTdIAN","00414153","Support Ticket","Licensing","Hi.  We are trying to get our licensing renewed for 1 year.  Our reseller BCN (<a href='https://shaun.fielding@bcn.co.uk' target='_blank'>shaun.fielding@bcn.co.uk</a>) has been trying to get a quote but apparently cannot get a response.  Our current license has expired already and we only have 18 days to renew before we lose functionality.  Please can someone contact Shaun and get our license quote sorted?

Thanks
James","","","","Oana confirmed that the renewal was performed and that the ticket can be closed.","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","97.1","Closed - Resolved","Iris Worldwide","James Grant","2024-07-05T11:44:08.000Z","2024-10-10T15:03:36.000Z"
