Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

I want to mention the following.

The Exit Points dashboard appears for the following device types:

--- CODE ---
Card Reader Device (MTD)                          
Card Reader Device (SCSI)                        
FireWire Bus                                      
Internal Card Reader                              
Internal Floppy Drive                            
Network Share                                    
Thunderbolt                                      
Unknown Device                                    
USB Storage Device                                
Windows Portable Device (Media Transfer Protocol)
ZIP Drive        
--- CODE ---

For these devices, we need to have the following events:

--- CODE ---
File Write
File Read-Write
File Copy  

--- CODE ---

As I see in the attached files jaime - dashboard issue2.png the customer has only the connected and disconnected events for the local row printer device.
These types of events are not showing in the dashboard.

Also in the Screenshot 2024-08-01 230447.png starting with 2024-07-30 and 2024-07-31, some logs appear in the dashboard.

My suggestion is to check if you have logs between the dates 2024-07-21 and 2024-07-30 that need to appear in the dashboard and don't appear or if the customer doesn't have proper logs for this period.
To check the logs, please navigate to Reports and Analysis, then select Log Report and filter by the specific Event or Device Type (mentioned above).

I do not understand what you mean. The case is about the Dashboard not showing the logs that are received.
Attached screenshots are here: https://nwxcorp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSupportFiles/Data/00412808

I will break down the screenshots:

Dashboard 1.png
Dashboard 2.png
Both show the Dashboard not having a graphical representation of the logs.

Siem 1,2,3,4 - Shows the SIEM enabled, the settings of the SIEM, and the fact that the logs did not reach the SIEM. I put this here to show the logs did not leave the EPP server as they did not arrive on the end users SIEM.

Please advise, the issue is that the Dashboard does not show the logs coming in.

Thank you!
