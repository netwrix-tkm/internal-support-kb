We are currently in a POC engagement with Netwrix and our licenses expired on January 31, 2025.  We requested an extension with Chris Roney, our account contact but have been unsuccessful.  The platform still reflects that our licenses have not been extended. 

We request that they be re-instated so that we may continue testing in order to move forward with the purchase of the Netwrix product. 

Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

Dena Thomas

She had requested that their license be extended thru 07March. The order was in Salesforce but the request had no yet been processed. I reached out to Sara Hall for assistance as she is more familiar with licensing issues. I contacted Vlad in order management who processed the POC license extension for me. Sara provided the license key to the customer and copied the account manager (Chris Roney) on the email for reference.","","","","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2025-02-07T19:16:20.000Z"
