Thanks Andrei!

I have just logged our change for 11/07/2024 1900 AEST, it has not been approved yet but I believe it will be and the date/time should not change.

I am following this online guide for the rough steps / pre-migration information, if there is anything else you think I should know, please reach out ðŸ˜Š

Hi Andrei,

Please let me know if you'd like me to log a new ticket for this. But as this is required for next weeks work I thought I would include it here first.

I have finally booted up our newly built server, logged in with root, created some Admin accounts for myself and Marcus and gone through the basics of the setup, so that I can get to the point of updating the server version.

Sadly, we are at the point you and I got to last time again. New server is not showing the library of Uploaded Patches. Could it perhaps be due to us using a Trial Licence in this time period?

New Server:

Thanks Andrei,

Do you know what Port it will need access by? What IP address it needs to connect to, to get to that next version before we can see the Offline Patch Library part?

I was hoping to get this new server ready to go before the night of the change, so less time is spent on it, or that there is less risk of it not working on the night.

Kind regards,

Thanks Andrei,

 

Do you know what Port it will need access by? What IP address it needs to connect to, to get to that next version before we can see the Offline Patch Library part?

I was hoping to get this new server ready to go before the night of the change, so less time is spent on it, or that there is less risk of it not working on the night.

 


Kind regards,

Hello,

For that page to be available the server needs internet access for the server to receive a server ID.
We can update the server in the remote connection.

Hi Andrei,

 

Please let me know if youâ€™d like me to log a new ticket for this. But as this is required for next weeks work I thought I would include it here first.

 

I have finally booted up our newly built server, logged in with root, created some Admin accounts for myself and Marcus and gone through the basics of the setup, so that I can get to the point of updating the server version.

 

Sadly, we are at the point you and I got to last time again. New server is not showing the library of Uploaded Patches. Could it perhaps be due to us using a Trial Licence in this time period?

 

New Server:



 

Old Server:



 


Kind regards,

Thank you,

Just to make sure we are not getting confused between the request.

We are not wanting to do Live Update, we are happy to do Offline Patches.
However we do not see the Table/field for available EPP software updates

But if you are saying, that in order to see that table/field, you must do at least one Live Update first, in order to see it, then we will try that ðŸ˜Š

Thanks again, sorry if Iâ€™m confusing the situation.

Kind regards,
