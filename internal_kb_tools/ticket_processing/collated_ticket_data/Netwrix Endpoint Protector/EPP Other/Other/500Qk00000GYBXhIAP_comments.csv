@WaitingOnEngineer
A few improvements were made related to Easylock deployments and read only functionality:

	 - 	how the deployment is made
	 - 	how the errors are threat, because a stange strange Apple was discovered when the device was disconnected when the Easylock app was still opened.
A test build was created which contains these fixes. This test build can be downloaded from:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp14102024/EPPMac3.0.4.0012.Notarized.tar

!!!! DULY NOTE: this is just a test built, please install it only on few computers.
