After investigating this along with our Developers it seems that problem of  the slow UI might be generated by the fact that the clients are communicating with the server at a very low interval - every 20 seconds




As per this we would like to ask you if we can modify this refresh interval from 20 seconds to the default value of 300 seconds or even at a higher one - 500 seconds.

Hi Himanshu,

After investigating this along with our Developers it seems that problem of  the slow UI might be generated by the fact that the clients are communicating with the server at a very low interval - every 20 seconds

[cid:image005.png@01DAC250.20D43000]


As per this we would like to ask you if we can modify this refresh interval from 20 seconds to the default value of 300 seconds or even at a higher one - 500 seconds.

After changing the refresh time interval from Global Settings it seems that the load on the appliance is much lower.
As per this the appliance should work much better. Please check and confirm.

Hi Himanshu,

After investigating this along with our Developers it seems that problem of  the slow UI might be generated by the fact that the clients are communicating with the server at a very low interval - every 20 seconds

[cid:a55580d8-0af0-4d1e-82ff-72fef9f4aef9@Image_5_]


As per this we would like to ask you if we can modify this refresh interval from 20 seconds to the default value of 300 seconds or even at a higher one - 500 seconds.

Dear Himanshu,

After changing the refresh time interval from Global Settings it seems that the load on the appliance is much lower.
As per this the appliance should work much better. Please check and confirm.

Dear Himanshu,

After changing the refresh time interval from Global Settings it seems that the load on the appliance is much lower.
As per this the appliance should work much better. Please check and confirm.

Hi Himanshu,

After investigating this along with our Developers it seems that problem of  the slow UI might be generated by the fact that the clients are communicating with the server at a very low interval - every 20 seconds

[cid:image006.png@01DAC34E.376D5B30]


As per this we would like to ask you if we can modify this refresh interval from 20 seconds to the default value of 300 seconds or even at a higher one - 500 seconds.
