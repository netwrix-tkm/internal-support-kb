After several trials he was able to attach it. Content aware policies thresholds and actions are as below in order, 1-Threshold :100 Action:Block&Remediate , 2- Threshold:50 Action:Report Only, 3-Threshold:10 Action:Report Only","","","","When the user tries to send an image the EPP client has two options. The first one is to use the extracted text content of the image saved in the local database. In this particular case obviously there will be no extracted content since we are dealing with a new image. In this case, the EPP client will have to perform OCR on the spot. This can take between a few seconds and even minutes sometimes. In this time, the transfer is not allowed. When OCR is done, if the file has no threats, the next attempt to upload the file will be allowed.
If the EPP client does not finish with OCR in the max waiting time (set to 9 seconds) and the file is automatically blocked.
This happens mostly for new files and if you wait a little bit, the file will be finally transferred","","Alin Anca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","56.3","Closed - Resolved","Tradebyte Software GmbH","Kevin Sturm","2024-10-21T07:23:43.000Z","2024-12-16T14:31:39.000Z"
