So we need an API for the EPP that we can integrate with the SIEM to get the data to investigate the incident. Please share the API and its documentation.","","","","Info provided.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","HSC","maneesh garg","2025-02-20T10:36:46.000Z","2025-02-27T12:39:17.000Z"
