"500Qk00000LKC91IAH","00434330","Support Ticket","Trial Linux Licenses, please?","we're again trying to evaluate using EPP on Linux. Our goal is to install the EPP client on Ubuntu 24.04 server. Our new VDI replacement is KASM, we know we can't run the EPP agent on a container but want to test to see if we can run it on the container host to catch the kernel calls the containers would make. so I'm hoping for a few linux trial licenses and an installer link for the latest epp client software for Ubuntu, preferably 24.04. Thanks!","","We provided the download link for the Ubuntu 24.04 epp client software and asked Sara Hall to help with the licensing part.

We have included Julia Greene in the ticket to handle the licensing part.

Julia helped with the order request for the new licenses.

The licenses have been sent to the customer.","We are waiting for a response from CS regarding the customer's request for the trial license.

We are waiting for the licensing to be provided and if everything is ok we will close this ticket.

We are waiting for the Orders team to provide the new license key.

We are waiting for the customer to confirm he managed to upload the new license file to the server.","We provided the download link for the Ubuntu 24.04 epp client.
