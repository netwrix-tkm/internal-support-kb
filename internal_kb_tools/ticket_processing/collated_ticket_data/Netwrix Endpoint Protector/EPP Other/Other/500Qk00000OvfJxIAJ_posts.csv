We are planning to decommission our on-prem ESXi hosts so wish to use EPP on Hyper-V or potentially on Azure.

We initially tried a migration but the new VM is not connecting to the network.

The ESXi deployment was from your appliance so we wondered if there was a similar VHD deployment we could use to deploy new to Hyper-V?

- the customer asked about deployment on Hyper-V and Azure
- sent them the deployment guides for both, and the download link for the EPP server image","","","","005Qk000001nVi2IAE","2025-05-08T12:48:46.000Z"
