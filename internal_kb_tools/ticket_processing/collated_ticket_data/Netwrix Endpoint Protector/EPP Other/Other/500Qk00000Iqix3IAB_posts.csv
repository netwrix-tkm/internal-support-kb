We have discussed this topic more than once in our previous remote sessions, customer confirmed in email that the endpoints show as ""Trusted"" after the conditions are met with the proper configurations outlined in the guide ""How to ensure prerequisites for macOS endpoints are in place2.pdf"" we consider this subject solved.","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-01-21T06:28:48.000Z"
