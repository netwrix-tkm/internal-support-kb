"500Qk00000BXkvOIAT","00411294","Support Ticket","Super Admin Password Error","When I logged into the EPP Portal with my admin account, I was automatically directed to a page to change my password.  It wouldn't recognize my current password and kept saying it was incorrect.  I verified multiple times I was typing in the correct password.  I couldn't navigate away from the password reset page, so I had another admin reset my EPP password.  After he did so, I wasn't able to log in with the new password.  However, my old password still worked and I was no longer being directed to the password reset page.  We decided to completely delete and recreate my EPP account.  Again, I was set up with a temporary password.  This password didn't work, but my old, original password did.  I do not wish to change my password from the original, but I need someone to diagnose why this occurred and what we can do to prevent further issues.","","","","Made adjustments in the database for the Super Admins.","","Flaviu Moldovan","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","12.1","Closed - Resolved","SingleSource Property Solutions / V300 DC+CAP","Bryan Lantz","2024-06-06T20:23:27.000Z","2024-06-18T23:01:10.000Z"
