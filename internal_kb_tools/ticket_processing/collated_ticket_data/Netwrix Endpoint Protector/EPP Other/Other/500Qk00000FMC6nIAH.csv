we receive notifications, Security Advisory emails, from <a href='https://security-notifications@netwrix.com' target='_blank'>security-notifications@netwrix.com</a>
Can you add another email to receive these kind of notifications:
<a href='https://itsupport@hqla-x.com' target='_blank'>itsupport@hqla-x.com</a>

Or is there a way to manage the list of users by ourselves ?

thanks,
