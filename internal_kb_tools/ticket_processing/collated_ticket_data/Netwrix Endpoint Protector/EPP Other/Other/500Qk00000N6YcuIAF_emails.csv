We have arranged the meeting for tomorrow at 11:00, as during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom
Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Daniel! Hello! Unfortunately, i don’t have the possibilities to carry
out the preparatory work as snapshots. But the customer administrator won’t
be available this week either. Maybe we can arrange it for next week?

We will have a meeting with Netwrix Support Engineer (with the same
customer)  on Monday at 11:00 related to another case (#434541). Maybe we
can organize them sequentially?

Hello Elena,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

We can schedule the remote session on Monday from 12:00 if that is okay with you, since the remote for the 11:00 is for a different issue.

Please check with the customer and let us know if we can proceed.

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Daniel! Hello! Unfortunately, i don’t have the possibilities to carry out the preparatory work as snapshots. But the customer administrator won’t be available this week either. Maybe we can arrange it for next week?

We will have a meeting with Netwrix Support Engineer (with the same customer)  on Monday at 11:00 related to another case (#434541). Maybe we can organize them sequentially?

Hello Elena,

We have arranged the meeting for tomorrow at 11:00, as during the remote we will need access to SSH, we would like to ask you to have prepared prior to our session, a snapshot of your Endpoint Protector appliance from the virtualisation environment (VMWare, HyperV, AWS,Azure, GoogleCloud).
This would represent a double safety measure and also a quick way we can revert to the initial settings in the case where any modifications inadvertently affect the server or environment.

Without having a snapshot prepared and confirmed in written, we will not proceed further with troubleshooting the backend.

Also, for better control during the remote session, we will please ask you to have the following apps installed:

-Putty

-Zoom
Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
