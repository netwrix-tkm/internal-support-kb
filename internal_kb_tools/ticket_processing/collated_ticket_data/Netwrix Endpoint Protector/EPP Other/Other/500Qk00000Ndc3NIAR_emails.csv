Hello,

Please let me know your availability or preferred time for a remote connection.
Before the remote connection, please import a new Epp VM to VMware.
Following the steps below you can try to migrate the server if it does not work we can do it together.

Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.


Kind regards

Thank you for your time.
As discussed, it is not possible to cleanly move the logs from the old server to the new one.
That is why it is recommended to use Backup V2 to migrate the server. This option does not take the old logs to avoid any issues on the new server.
You can either keep the old server to browse the older logs or export them to a .csv file.

Kind regards

Migration [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Ndc3N:ref ]

 

Hello,

Thank you for your time.
As discussed, it is not possible to cleanly move the logs from the old
server to the new one.
That is why it is recommended to use Backup V2 to migrate the server. This
option does not take the old logs to avoid any issues on the new server.
You can either keep the old server to browse the older logs or export them
to a .csv file.

Kind regards

Hello Anderi,

 

Hope you are doing well.

 

The upgraded Console is working fine—thank you for your support. Additionally, we would like to request the service name and installation directory of the EPP client. This information is required to integrate with our NAC (Network Access Control) solution to validate whether the application is installed on user endpoints.

Your assistance in providing these details at your earliest convenience would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks & Regards
