"500Qk00000G9mVgIAJ","00421852","Support Ticket","What happens when our license expires?","I looked for documentation regarding what happens when the license expires on our you-hosted Endpoint Protector environment, but couldn't find anything. 
We ARE in the process of renewal, but fear that we won't get it done before the license expires (9/26) and wanted to know definitively what will happen to the environment and the clients. 

Is there a grace period? 
Will we just not be able to enroll new hosts?
Will we completely lose access to the server?
Will the clients stop using/enforcing their policy?
Will the clients uninstall?

Thank you for any information!
