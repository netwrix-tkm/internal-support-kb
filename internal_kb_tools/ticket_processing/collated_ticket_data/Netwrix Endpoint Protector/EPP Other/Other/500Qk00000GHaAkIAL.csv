In order to validate annualy our configuration, we would like to export the computer list in our Endpoint to compare on our active directory. Our problem is, from the computer menu, if I select all entry and do a csv export it doesn't export all the computer (I beleive it seems limited to 200 computers). How can I export all the computer in CSV ?","","","","Case closed, proposed actioned meets the needs of the customer.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","19.0","Closed - Resolved","QUALITY ASSISTANCE S.A.","Guillaume Mainil","2024-09-26T08:48:08.000Z","2024-10-15T07:41:38.000Z"
