Hi Zachary, that's correct yes. We updated them two maybe three weeks ago. I assumed they'd update with a force policy like you say but that didn't seem to be the case. I've had a laptop on my desk all day that hadn't updated. I've just been to lunch and come back and it has now updated. Seems to be taking quite a while but that's fine. As long as we've done it correctly.
Thanks

Thank you for the update and feedback.  The details should be updated immediately when the EPP client checks in to the server for a policy update.  If this change is not effective immediately after connecting to the EPP Server that we will need to collect logs and investigate.   Would you still like us to proceed and close this case?


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

Huge apologies for the delay in replying, things have been crazy here but starting to catch up.

No, thank you for your help previously. It didn’t seem like the change was immediate for us, some machines took over 4 hours but all seem to have updated now.

You can close the call, thank you

KR
John
