Hi Team, 
I´m asking about server's backend access if it exist and if there is any chance you would give it to us, since we got troubles to use it.

Thanks a lot

SSH access to the EPP server is not provided to customers by the policy company. Can you let us know more exactly the reason you would need it?

Thank you!

The SSH access to the EPP server is restricted to the EPP Support team only.
 
We do not provide SSH access to customers both to protect Netwrix's intellectual property and to avoid changes being made to the backend that would affect the server's functionality.
 
In order to administrate the product, SSH access is not needed, everything the admin needs can be performed in the User Interface.
 
In case a problem that requires SSH access appears, customers need to open a support ticket and our Support Team will take over and troubleshoot.

Hi Team, 

we are just checking the possibility to have access to EPP logs in our new SIEM (including any root action).
Any suggestion how to do it?

Thanks

We do offer the option to forward logs to a SIEM solution. Please follow these steps:


	Navigate to Appliance -> SIEM Integration.
	Click on the Add New button.
	Fill in the server details and select the log types(including ""Admin Actions"" - root actions) you want to forward.


If you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for the update.

I recommend opening a new ticket and including all the details that are missing or altered in the logs forwarded to the SIEM. This will help us address the issue more effectively.
