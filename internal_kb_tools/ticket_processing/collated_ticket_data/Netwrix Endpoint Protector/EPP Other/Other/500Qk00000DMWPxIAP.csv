"500Qk00000DMWPxIAP","00415574","Support Ticket","Please make the client licenses of macOS decrease from 350 to 250.","Hi Support Team,


The unit of Kakao Enterprise has 350 clients of macOS but the customer wants to decrease the client licenses to 250.

So, could you give us the two schedules of Zoom session for removing 100 client licenses of this unit? The customer will pick one of the dates you send. 4 PM KST (10 AM Romania time) is a good time for us and this customer.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.


Best Regards,
Jack Jung","","","","License was reduced in a remote session","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","23.3","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Korea","Support Netwrix","2024-07-22T00:51:28.000Z","2024-08-14T09:08:14.000Z"
