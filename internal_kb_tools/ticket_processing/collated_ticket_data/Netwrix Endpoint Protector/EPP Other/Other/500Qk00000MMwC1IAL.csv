I would like to double-check our situation.
Does EPP (in our case) have any other root access besides the GUI?

Thanks

Kamil B","","The customer requested an SSH account. We asked for more details regarding this request.

We answered the customer that we do not provide SSH access to customers both to protect Netwrix's intellectual property and to avoid changes being made to the backend that would affect the server's functionality and in order to administrate the product, SSH access is not needed, everything the admin needs can be performed in the User Interface.

We provided the steps to activate and use this.","Waiting for the customer's reply.","Closing this ticket as we do not provide SSH access to customers both to protect Netwrix's intellectual property and to avoid changes being made to the backend that would affect the server's functionality and in order to administrate the product, SSH access is not needed, everything the admin needs can be performed in the User Interface.","","Iosif Muntean","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","29.1","Closed - Resolved","Fio Banka","kamil Bednar","2025-02-27T12:08:22.000Z","2025-03-28T15:39:08.000Z"
