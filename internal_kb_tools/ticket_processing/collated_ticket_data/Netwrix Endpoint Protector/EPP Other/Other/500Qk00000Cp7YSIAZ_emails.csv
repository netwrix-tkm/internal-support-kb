Hi Andre,

 

 

First, thank you for your support.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide remote support tomorrow, but we can provide it next week.

 

Please kindly provide two available schedules for next week when you are coinvent. 

The preferred time is 4 PM Korea Standard Time (10 AM Romania Time) if you are O.K.

 

I look forward to your reply.

Have a nice day!

 

 







Best Regards,

Jack Jung

Hi Jack,

I would like to check some details relating to the audit log backup via the back-end of the client's EPP Server appliance.

Can we arrange a remote session with the end customer for Thursday please?


Kind regards
