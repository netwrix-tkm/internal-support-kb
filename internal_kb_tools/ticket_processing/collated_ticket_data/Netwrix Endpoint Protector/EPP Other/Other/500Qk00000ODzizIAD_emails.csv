Hi Umesh, 

 

Thank you for your reply. 

 

Please allow us to check this internally and get back to you. 

 

Meanwhile, can you please confirm if the customer signed up in the Customer Portal <https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_products.html> ?

We have 2 different types of Portals: Customer Portal and Partner Portal and we just want to make sure the customer signed up to corresponding portal in order for them to get access to the product trainings available.

 

Thank you! Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alexandra Bolfa
