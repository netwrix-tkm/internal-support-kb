We have deployed EPP in our on-premises instance. While we are able to ping the IP address, we are unable to connect to the console via the web. Although the frontend screen displays options 1 through 5 can be seen

If I restart the VM i can see an error ""failed to start A high <a href='https://per....er' target='_blank'>per....er</a> and a reverse proxy server.""

Unfortunately I cannot see attachment section here so if you email me on
<a href='https://dipesh.ramesh@pwc.com' target='_blank'>dipesh.ramesh@pwc.com</a> I can attach the error message

We do have support purchase for this application so happy to provide proof if require. Thanks","","We asked the customer to check if they attached 2 NIC's to the EPP VM","Waiting for the customer's confirmation.","The server was initially configured with only one Network Adapter. We informed the customer about the necessity to add a second one and this solved the reported issue.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","PwC","DFI SUPPORT","2025-04-02T14:47:59.000Z","2025-04-02T15:43:01.000Z"
