I made an error when cleaning up the old clients. All clients were deleted from the PROD console because I selected the wrong checkmark.

Can you please import a backup of the clients/client settings.
The accidental deletion took place on 2025-02-11 08:44:39

If you have any questions or problems, please let me know. 

Regards
