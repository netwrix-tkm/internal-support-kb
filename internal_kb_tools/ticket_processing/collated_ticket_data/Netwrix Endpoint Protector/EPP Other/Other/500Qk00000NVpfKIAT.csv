Also, the password they were referring to in the description was the uninstall password.
We went on and gave them the zap tool as it was only for one device and then deleted the tool through shift+delete.
After the restart, Lokesh confirmed the EPP was removed successfully.
Closing ticket as resolved.","Will have to remote in to assist maybe with changing the password.","Issue solved after uninstalling the client through the ZAP tool.","","Marian Ilies","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Shakta Technologies Pvt Ltd","Lokesh N","2025-03-31T10:44:46.000Z","2025-04-01T08:17:45.000Z"
