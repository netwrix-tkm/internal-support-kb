Connected remote to the SSH, they also made a snapshot first.
Went on and applied the procedure 4 from the backend and changed the password for the root admin.
Then we tested the login and he could get in without a problem and also he could change it too.
Agreed to close the case.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-09T11:28:39.000Z"
