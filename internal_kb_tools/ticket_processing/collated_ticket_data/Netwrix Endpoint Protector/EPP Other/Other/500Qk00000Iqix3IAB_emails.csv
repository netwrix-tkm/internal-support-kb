Dear Andre,

As per call with customer, still the devices are showing up as NA even after certificates are installed for MAC devices.

Also, after installing the agent on MAC device it is capturing user details multiple times in users tab.

Please find the attached screenshot for reference.

Kindly schedule remote session to resolve the certificate trusted issue.

Thank you
