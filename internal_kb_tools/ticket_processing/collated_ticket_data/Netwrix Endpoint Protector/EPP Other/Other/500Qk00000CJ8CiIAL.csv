I'm opening a support case on behalf of the customer Easebuzz as they are experiencing the below issue described by the customer:

""DLP agents are making excessive cache in systems, and because of that, our systems are getting slow. We uninstalled the agent from a couple of systems and monitored it for a week, and no excessive cache file was there. Once we install the agent, we get the cache files in surplus.

Kindly please help us with that. We need a reason for that and a way to stop that from happening.""

Thank you!","","","","Custoemr confirmed to close.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","156.3","Closed - Resolved","Easebuzz Pvt Ltd","Aman Shekhar","2024-06-26T05:57:10.000Z","2024-11-29T12:47:13.000Z"
