"500Qk00000OZZgEIAX","00443487","Support Ticket","|| CAP POLICY ISSUE - POLICY BAZAR-29042025TUE ||","Unable to block the custom content & SSN numbers.","","29/04/2025
Client is unable to block custom content and SSN numbers.

30/04/2025

Connected remote with assisting the client on the CAP policy.
Seems like he had the Global Threshold misconfigured so I advised for more granular control to use content rule detection and set up the threshold invididually.
Also, he wanted to see if there's  a way to block but allow clients to bypass the cap policy and I showed him the block and remediate option.

Asked to tweak the policy and keep testing it as he wanted and we will connect remote on Friday for further troubleshooting if needed.

Connected remote with the client to assist with other CAP policies.
He wanted to create a CAP policy to restrict the desired PII/CreditCard content regardless of the file.
Went on and assisted with creating the policy and tested. It was working accordingly.

Also tested with files that did not contained any sensitive info and they went through without a problem.

He wanted to try also the OCR function as they had pictures with sensitive info to block but also screenshots with non sensitive things to share.

Went on and adjusted the OCR and tested again. Client was able to block only the images with the sensitive data.
Agreed to close the ticket.","30/04/2025
Will schedule a remote for Friday.","Issue sorted after creating and sorting out the CAP policy.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","3.0","Closed - Resolved","Satcom Infotech","Thanu shree","2025-04-29T10:22:19.000Z","2025-05-02T10:53:12.000Z"
