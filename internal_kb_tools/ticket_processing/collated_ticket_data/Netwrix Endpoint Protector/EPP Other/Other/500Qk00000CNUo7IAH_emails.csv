Let me know if we can schedule a remote session in order to apply the offline patches in order to update the EPP Server to the latest version, including the patch which fixes the vulnerability on the EPP Server.
Also I will give you the download links for the latest EPP Agents for both Windows and MacOS which are addressing this vulnerability.

Best regards,

Hello,

I've done an offline patch before unless the process has changed, I'm not sure we need to do a remote session unless you feel that we need to.

I would prefer to apply the fix during a remote session, in order to make sure that it applies successfully. If it fails to apply, then we will have to make some changes in the database in order to apply it again.
Let me know if you will have time for a short 15 min meeting in order to apply the patch today.

Thank you,
Emil
