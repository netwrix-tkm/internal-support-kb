In the 5.9.0.0 update, I saw a new feature that ""Introduces a Command-line switch (environment variable in Linux) during EPP client installation to deactivate the CAP driver, streamlining installation when CAP functionality is not needed.""

I am using RHEL 8. I am unsure how to use the feature mentioned above. Could you guide me on how to use it? Or if there is any documentation available, I would appreciate it if you could share it with me.

Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-13T07:32:10.000Z"
