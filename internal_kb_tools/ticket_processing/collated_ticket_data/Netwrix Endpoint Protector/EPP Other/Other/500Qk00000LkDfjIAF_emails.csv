At the current moment this has seemed to have resolved for everyone. None of the active user accounts seem to exhibit the issues currently.

Should be safe to close this currently. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hello Lawrence,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00435420. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00435420
Ticket Subject: Web portal, Chrome, Instant Session Ending
Ticket Details: The webportal with all of our team members here has been having consistent issue where the sessions in end chrome. Just it will not notify us until we refresh the page. I won't capture setting changes and will happen while actively navigating around.

We have been migrating this by using Edge, which seems to hold the session open and be fine.

Any assistance for this would be great, thank you for your time and consideration.

Thank you!

Iosif Muntean
Technical Support Engineer Tier 1
