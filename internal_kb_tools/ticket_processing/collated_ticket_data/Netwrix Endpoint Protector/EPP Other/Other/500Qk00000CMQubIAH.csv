Today, I got information about ""ADV-2024-002-Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in CoSoSys Endpoint Protector and CoSoSys Unify"". The details are yet to be released on a Netwirx portal as I know.  

Could you provide any patches or guildlines to fix it when they are ready?

We need to infrom our customers and distributors about the schedule and details for addressing this vulnerability in Korean market. 

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.
