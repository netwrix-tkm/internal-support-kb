Could you please request access to the server to do more investigations?

We will need to check the following:

	 - 	iNodes,
	 - 	the server resources 
	 - 	the number of logs that are stored in the quicklogs / workers
	 - 	to check if there is a way to decrease the iNdods

Based on the above results, maybe other checks are needed.


Let me know when you have access.

Regards,
Augustina

If you have access to the server let's sync and have a call to do all the checks again.
Thanks
