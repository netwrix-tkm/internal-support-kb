Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz

I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

 

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?

I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.

Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

 

Thank You.

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?

Hello,

I see it is missing from the UI as well.
If you wish we can schedule a remote connection to check in the back but if it is not present I'm not sure we can find out why.

Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-43faa4dcec305189&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.endpointprotector.com%2Foffline_patches%2FEPP500665941.tar.gz>


I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-9b6a9b9f2172b695&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.endpointprotector.com%2Fepp%2Fvirtual-app-email>

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?
I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.
Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

Thank You.

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

If you wish we can schedule a remote connection to check in the back but if it is not present I'm not sure we can find out why.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz

I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

You can try to delete them from the actions column.

Hi Andrei,

 

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?

I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.

Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

 

Thank You.

Stephen Grace

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-43faa4dcec305189&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.endpointprotector.com%2Foffline_patches%2FEPP500665941.tar.gz>


I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-9b6a9b9f2172b695&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.endpointprotector.com%2Fepp%2Fvirtual-app-email>

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hello,

You can try to delete them from the actions column.
If that does not work we can schedule a remote connection for tomorrow. Do you have a preferred time?

Hi Andrei,

Thank You.

Hi Andrei,

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?
I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.
Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

Thank You.

If that is on the audit will not be removed from the list, also the shadows will remain on the server.
Please turn off the ""Keep copy on Epp Server"" option and create anther audit to test.

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

If you wish we can schedule a remote connection to check in the back but if it is not present I'm not sure we can find out why.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-43faa4dcec305189&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.endpointprotector.com%2Foffline_patches%2FEPP500665941.tar.gz>


I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-9b6a9b9f2172b695&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.endpointprotector.com%2Fepp%2Fvirtual-app-email>

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hello,

You can try to delete them from the actions column.
If that does not work we can schedule a remote connection for tomorrow. Do you have a preferred time?

Hi Andrei,

Yes, we can do zoom meeting to delete it from system and I think it already backup to external storage.
Maybe we can do it by tomorrow and for the next, is there a way to delete it by us?

Thank You.

Would you like to schedule another meeting to remove them manually?

Example this capture, does it mean that number 1 and 2 log files is kept in the system?

Thank You.

Hi Andrei,

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?
I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.
Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

Thank You.

Please turn off the ""Keep copy on Epp Server"" option and create anther audit to test.

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

If you wish we can schedule a remote connection to check in the back but if it is not present I'm not sure we can find out why.

Backup is running now.

Is it because of no data, so the backup didn’t run?

 

Thank You.

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz

I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

 

I’m referring to System Maintenance – Audit Log Backup.

[Inline image name : image017.png]

Example this capture, does it mean that number 1 and 2 log files is kept in the system?

 

Thank You.

 

Regards,

Stephen Grace

Hi Andrei,

 

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?

I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.

Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

 

Thank You.

 

Regards,

Stephen Grace

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

Is it because of no data, so the backup didn't run?

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
As we talked about, please create a VM snapshot and update the server to 5.9.4.1.
You can use the offline patch below to update the server.
Epp 5.9.4.0 to Epp 5.9.4.1
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500665941.tar.gz<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-43faa4dcec305189&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.endpointprotector.com%2Foffline_patches%2FEPP500665941.tar.gz>


I will also include the steps for migration if needed.
Hello,

To update please follow the steps below.

1. Download the new VM from the link below.
https://www.endpointprotector.com/epp/virtual-app-email<https://protect2.fireeye.com/v1/url?k=31323334-501cfaeb-313521f5-454455535732-9b6a9b9f2172b695&q=1&e=6c03a3ac-bf79-4a49-94d1-2eca47107983&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.endpointprotector.com%2Fepp%2Fvirtual-app-email>

2. Import it into the environment, and check the version on the browser in the lower right corner.

3. Update both Epp servers up to the version of the new server using the Live Update or offline patches. If offline patches are needed please let me know the current version and I will send you the patches.
- Before updating please create a snapshot of the VM to have a restore point in case anything goes wrong.

4. Once both servers are at the same version, please go to the old server in ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Create"",
- name the backup and add a description.
- click ""Save""
- copy the ""System Backup Key"" to a notepad.
- click ""Yes, I saved the System Backup Key"".
- wait for the Backup to finish.
- download the backup

5. In the new server please go to ""System Maintenance > System backup V2"".
Here, please
- click ""Import and Restore (Migrate)""
- click ""Choose File""
- select the backup created in the old server
- add the ""System Backup Key""
- click ""Import'
- wait for the import to finish.

6. Once the backup is imported refresh the page and log in using your old credentials. Also, check the license page to make sure they are present.

7. Once the import is finished you can turn off the old vm and change the IP of the new vm to the old one. Please do this from the vm console.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei,

Actually, how is the process of the audit log behavior?
I tried with 2 condition last night, with and without Keep on Server. But with these 2 condition, the files is still shown in the list.
Is it just a list in EPP dashboard or it has the file that kept in the system?

Thank You.

Hello,

When creating the audit you can keep the logs on the server.
I was referring to the option in External Storage.

Hello,

Regarding the external storage.
can you please save the setting with the option to keep copies on the server turned on, then save it again with the option to keep copies on the server turned off?
Then create a new onetime backup to confirm if the file is sent and removed from the server?
Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your time during the remote connection.
The backup was not generated because there were no logs to take.
As discussed in the meeting, please let me know if the backup is removed from the server after saving it on the external storage.

Hello,

I see it is missing from the UI as well.
If you wish we can schedule a remote connection to check in the back but if it is not present I'm not sure we can find out why.
