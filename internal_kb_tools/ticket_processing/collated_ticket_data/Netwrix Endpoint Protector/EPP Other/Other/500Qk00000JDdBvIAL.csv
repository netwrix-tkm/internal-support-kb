our HyperV-Admin is not able to deploy the new VHD-Image as this seems to be only compatible with HyperV-2022. Do you have an image also for HyperV-2019?
Many thanks and kind Regards,
Gerrit Beyken","","","","The new Image that were provided was according to my „HyperV-Collegue“ also not importable on our HyperV-Systems.
He worked around with importing the Image on a HyperV-2022-Testsystem he had set up and exported the VM. With this Image he was able to setup the new EPP-Server-VM on our HyperV-2019-Cluster.","","Andrei Pop","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","8.6","Closed - Resolved","Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Nordrhein","Gerrit Beyken","2024-12-07T14:36:45.000Z","2024-12-16T05:44:32.000Z"
