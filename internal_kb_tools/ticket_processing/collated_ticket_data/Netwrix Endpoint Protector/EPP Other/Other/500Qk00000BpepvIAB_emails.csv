PLease colect a set of log using the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access Gmail.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Hi Andrei Pop,

 

I opened the policy deny lists and enabled all deny list policies. Some systems are blocking Gmail, while others can still access it. Please help resolve this issue. Please take a look at the screenshot below.

Hello,

PLease colect a set of log using the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access Gmail.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.

Hi Andrei Pop,

Yes, DPI is enabled, and I also added https://mail.google.com/* to the deny list. Even after that, Gmail is still accessible on some laptops.

Thank you,

Hi Andrei Pop,

I opened the policy deny lists and enabled all deny list policies. Some systems are blocking Gmail, while others can still access it. Please help resolve this issue. Please take a look at the screenshot below.

Hello,

PLease colect a set of log using the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access Gmail.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hello,

PLease colect a set of log using the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access Gmail.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hello,

PLease colect a set of log using the steps below.
1. Download the archive to an empty folder at the following link:
 https://download.endpointprotector.com/Support_files/support_tool/SupportTool_win.zip
2. Unzip the sub-archive that corresponds to the operating system of the client computer concerned.
3. Double-click the EPPSupportTool_64 or _32.exe file. This opens a dialog box.
4.a. Select Create Log file and click Execute.
4.b. Select Create DPI Log file and click Execute.
This creates a file called eppclient.log and sslsplit.log in the root directory of the C: drive.
5. Right-click the EPP client and click ""Update Policies Now"".
6. Access Gmail.
7. Open EPPSupportTool and click Export Files. This will copy files to the current folder.
8. Send me the created files (archived) so that we can investigate them further.

Kind regards

Hi Andrei Pop,

 

Yes, DPI is enabled, and I also added  https://mail.google.com/* to the deny list. Even after that, Gmail is still accessible on some laptops.

 

Thank you,

Mohammad Azam.

Hi Andrei Pop,

 

I opened the policy deny lists and enabled all deny list policies. Some systems are blocking Gmail, while others can still access it. Please help resolve this issue. Please take a look at the screenshot below.
