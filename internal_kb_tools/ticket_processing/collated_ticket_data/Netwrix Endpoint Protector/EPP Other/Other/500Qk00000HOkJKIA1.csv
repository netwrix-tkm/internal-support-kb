We have an office in Hong Kong that use laptops that are not part of the company network. They use the laptops to get to our Citrix environment. The laptops get shipped to them with our security stack pre-installed. Is there a way to update the EPP policy on these machines over the internet considering they don't report to the management console because they aren't on the Ropesgray network?","","","","the requested information was provided to the customer. they confirmed ticket closure","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","61.8","Closed - Resolved","Ropes and Gray LLC","Matt Joyce","2024-10-23T20:20:52.000Z","2024-12-24T15:39:43.000Z"
