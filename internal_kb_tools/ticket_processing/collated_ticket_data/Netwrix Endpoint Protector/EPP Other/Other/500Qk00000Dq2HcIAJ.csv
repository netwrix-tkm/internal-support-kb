"500Qk00000Dq2HcIAJ","00416738","Support Ticket","License Renewal","We received a new license from our vendor for renewing Endpoint Protector. The issue is that the license is one file for 300 endpoints. We have 7 isolated domains where the 300 licenses are distributed to. 

Can I please get one license file for each of the following lines?

Intel_Dev_Offline - 50 endpoints
Intel_Dev_Online - 40 endpoints
Intel_DR_Offline - 50 endpoints
Intel_DR_Online - 20 endpoints
Intel_PROD_Offline - 50 endpoints
Intel_PROD_Online - 20 endpoints
Intel_QA_Local - 50 endpoints
Intel_QA_Remote - 20 endpoints

Here is the new license we received:
