Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Ram,

Our remote session is scheduled for 4PM IST not 3PM, unfortunately I have another call scheduled during 6 PM IST.  The first slot that I have open after is at 6:30 PM IST.

Should I move our remote session to 6:30 PM IST?

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Also PFA of attached Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf.

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. 

Thank you,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:

	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Our remote session is scheduled for 4PM IST not 3PM, unfortunately I have another call scheduled during 6 PM IST.  The first slot that I have open after is at 6:30 PM IST.

Should I move our remote session to 6:30 PM IST?

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Also PFA of attached Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf.

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. 

Thank you,

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Andre,

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too
large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide
the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been
waiting for a solution for the past 8 days.
Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them
a solution, so please provide us with a final solution.

PFA.

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution. 

 

PFA.

 

 




Thanks,

Ram Singh

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution. 

 

PFA.

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?



Kind regards

Hi Team,
 

As suggested we ran both the commands :- 

 

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

 

Also PFA of attached Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf.

 

Please check and provide us with the solution on a priority basis .

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. 

Thank you,

Yes, there were no files before restart . The Folder was empty but after
restart the j.log file was there. And i already shared the j.log file with
you.

Yes, there were no files before restart . The Folder was empty but after restart the j.log file was there. And i already shared the j.log file with you.

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution. 

 

PFA.

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Team,
 

As suggested we ran both the commands :- 

 

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

 

Also PFA of attached Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf.

 

Please check and provide us with the solution on a priority basis .

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. 

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution. 

 

PFA.

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Our remote session is scheduled for 4PM IST not 3PM, unfortunately I have another call scheduled during 6 PM IST.  The first slot that I have open after is at 6:30 PM IST.

Should I move our remote session to 6:30 PM IST?


Kind regards

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Also PFA of attached Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf.

 

Please check and provide us with the solution on a priority basis .

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".


Kind regards

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you. 

Thank you,

Thank you for getting back to me.  Unfortunately the Romanian team will be off on Monday and Tuesday (2nd and 3rd December) next week due to national holidays in Romania.  Can we schedule a remote session for the 4th December, Wednesday?

The reason for the remote connection is that we need remote control to debug the issue.  Endpoint Protector works okay on a clean Linux Ubuntu system, the issue seems to be something specific to the setup of the affected Ubuntu endpoint machine and we won't be able to identify the root cause of the issue without looking at the system in a remote session.

Please let me know if we can schedule the remote session for next week Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

This week  I will not be available, So please try to reschedule this call for Monday. 

 

Note:- It will be greatly helpful if you will provide me with a solution without taking the system remotely.

Yes, there were no files before restart . The Folder was empty but after restart the j.log file was there. And i already shared the j.log file with you.

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution. 

 

PFA.

Ram Singh

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you.

I have received the below feedback from our Dev team.

""There are installed and running on the system some packages that might interfere with EPP.  These are FortiClient, Wazuh and Scrut.  It would be helpful to know if EPP runs correctly if these packages are not installed.""

Could you please confirm if this is the case? That if these applications are removed then the issue also disappears?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for getting back to me.  Unfortunately the Romanian team will be off on Monday and Tuesday (2nd and 3rd December) next week due to national holidays in Romania.  Can we schedule a remote session for the 4th December, Wednesday?

The reason for the remote connection is that we need remote control to debug the issue.  Endpoint Protector works okay on a clean Linux Ubuntu system, the issue seems to be something specific to the setup of the affected Ubuntu endpoint machine and we won't be able to identify the root cause of the issue without looking at the system in a remote session.

Please let me know if we can schedule the remote session for next week Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution.

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Our remote session is scheduled for 4PM IST not 3PM, unfortunately I have another call scheduled during 6 PM IST.  The first slot that I have open after is at 6:30 PM IST.

Should I move our remote session to 6:30 PM IST?

Hi Ram,

The case is with our R&D team.  I noticed that the ""epp_client_daemon.log"" and ""eppsslsplit.log"" log files are empty.  These log files are important in order for us to do a proper analysis.  Can we have one affected user join in on a remote session today so that I can try and collect these logs files please?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".

Hello Ram,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. Could you take a screenshot of the network error that occurs? Also, have you tried the DPI stealthy driver? While you are checking on those, I am reassigning this ticket to someone in your time zone to better assist you.

Hi Andre,

Yes,  these three applications ( Forticlient , Wazuh , Scrut) are installed
and we can not remove them even for testing because these applications are
important. Also earlier it was working properly only after upgrading the
DLP packages in the user's machine we are facing issues.

Previous DLP version :- 2.4.2.1006
Upgraded / Current DLP version :- 2.4.3.1007 Affected OS :- Ubuntu 20.04

Note :- Now I am available for the remote session so please provide us with
a proper solution on the priority .

Thanks,
Ram Singh

Hi Andre,

 

Yes,  these three applications ( Forticlient , Wazuh , Scrut) are installed and we can not remove them even for testing because these applications are important. Also earlier it was working properly only after upgrading the DLP packages in the user's machine we are facing issues. 

 

Previous DLP version :- 2.4.2.1006

Upgraded / Current DLP version :- 2.4.3.1007 Affected OS :- Ubuntu 20.04

 

Note :- Now I am available for the remote session so please provide us with a proper solution on the priority . 

 




Thanks,

Ram Singh
System Administrator, Chronus

Hi Ram,

I have received the below feedback from our Dev team.

""There are installed and running on the system some packages that might interfere with EPP.  These are FortiClient, Wazuh and Scrut.  It would be helpful to know if EPP runs correctly if these packages are not installed.""

Could you please confirm if this is the case? That if these applications are removed then the issue also disappears?

Hi Ram,

Thank you for getting back to me.  Unfortunately the Romanian team will be off on Monday and Tuesday (2nd and 3rd December) next week due to national holidays in Romania.  Can we schedule a remote session for the 4th December, Wednesday?

The reason for the remote connection is that we need remote control to debug the issue.  Endpoint Protector works okay on a clean Linux Ubuntu system, the issue seems to be something specific to the setup of the affected Ubuntu endpoint machine and we won't be able to identify the root cause of the issue without looking at the system in a remote session.

Please let me know if we can schedule the remote session for next week Wednesday.


Kind regards

Hi Andre,

 

I followed all the recommended procedures. Since the file size is too large, I attached it to my ticket. I hope these logs are enough to provide the final solution. Also, this is a high priority ticket, and we have been waiting for a solution for the past 8 days. 

Also, daily users are complaining, and it's very difficult to provide them a solution, so please provide us with a final solution.

Hi Ram,

There seems to be a problem when initializing Deep Packet Inspection, it could be a crash.  We would need additional logs to further our investigation.

Can we ask you to enable the crash core collection please?

To enable crash core collection a line needs to be added in the ""limits.conf"" configuration file.

Please run the following commands on the Linux endpoint machine:

	""vim /etc/security/limits.conf""
	Then press ""i"" and add the following line ""root soft core unlimited""  (see below screenshot).
	After adding the line press ""ESC"" then press "" : "" and type "" wq! "" and hit "" Enter "", this will save the configuration file.
	A restart is required for this to take effect, please restart the system.
	Crash dumps should be available at /var/lib/apport/coredump/.  Please send us the crash dumps located in this location.
	Also please provide the system journal logs (collect the resulting "" j.log "" file): please run command "" journalctl --system > j.log ""
	In the same directory you will find the file "" j.log "", please send us this file.









Create the j.log log file by running ""journalctl --system > j.log"".



Please also send us a new set of epp client logs, you can use the Endpoint Protector client to upload the log files, under the tab ""Troubleshooting"" click on ""Upload Logs"".
For a guide on how to collect logs using this method please follow the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf""

Hi Ram,

The feedback that I received is that there seems to be an issue with DPI feature which cannot successfully initialize and is restarting in a loop.  To help debug this we need another log file.

The log file ""eppnetdlp.log"" needs to be created, please run the below commands:


	$ sudo su
	$ cd /var/log/epp-client/
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log
	$ touch /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log
	$ sudo touch /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log
	$ sudo service epp-client-daemon restart
	Reproduce the scenario described in the support ticket.
	Open the EPP client and click on ""Update Policies Now""
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/epp_client_daemon.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppsslsplit.log /home/user/Desktop/
	$ cp /var/log/epp-client/eppnetdlp.log /home/user/Desktop/


The issue needs to be reproduced, and then the log files collected and sent to us for investigation. Please note that this time there will be three log files, namely;

	epp_client_daemon.log
	eppsslsplit.log
	eppnetdlp.log

The most important file that we need here is eppnetdlp.log

Hi Ram,

Thank you for the video recording and the detail of the Linux distribution version.

Can I ask you to upgrade your Linux repositories please?, you would need to run these two commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

We would also need the log files to review, the log files will give us more insight of what happens when the browsing stops when Deep Packet Inspection is enabled.

You can enable the debug logging remotely from the EPP Server.  When logging is active it will create records on the endpoint while the issue is reproduced.  You will then need to initiate the uploading of the logs files (artifact) to the EPP Server, then download them from the UI and send it to us.

You can use the attached step by step guide ""How to enable and collect Debug Logs from Endpoint Protector Client v1.3.pdf"" on how to collect the logs (artifact). This method is done manually from the endpoint machine.

You can also collect the logs (artifact) remotely without having to access the endpoint machine, please refer to the attached guide ""Collect logs Remotely v1.2.pdf"".
