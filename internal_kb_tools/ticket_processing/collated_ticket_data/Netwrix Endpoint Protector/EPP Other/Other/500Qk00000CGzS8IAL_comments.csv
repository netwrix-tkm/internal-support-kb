"00aQk000007YCvZIAW","500Qk00000CGzS8IAL","Matt called in needing immediate assistance, and picked an option in the phone tree.
Mgmt is freaking out about this.
Advised that the team is not part of the phone tree, and they will need to work with Emil.
Matt wants me to forward the call to Emil's # to talk to Emil directly & immediately.
I advised that I do not know Emil's #, nor if Emil even has a #.

M. Purdin provided Ext. 8502 to leave a voicemail, and a person from the team will call back ASAP.

Matt doesn't want a voicemail, and asks to speak to someone on the team.

I advised that there is no one immediately available, but if he leaves a VM someone will call back as soon as they're free.

Matt accepted this, and I transferred the call to 8502","0054u000008AYNaAAO","2024-06-25T17:50:39.000Z","2024-06-25T17:50:39.000Z","false","false"
