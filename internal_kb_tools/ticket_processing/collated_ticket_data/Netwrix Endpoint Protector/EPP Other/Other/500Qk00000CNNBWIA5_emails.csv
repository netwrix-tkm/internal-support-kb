			A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the application configuration component of the Endpoint Protector and Unify agent which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to manipulate the configuration of either their own or another client endpoint resulting in the bypass of certain configuration options. Manipulation of the application configuration can result in local policy bypass and in some scenarios remote code execution.
		
	


 
In order to fix this, there is a hotfix available in Dashboard > Live update > Check Now, you can select it and press below ""Apply Updates"" to be applied in your system. Please note this Hotfix is strongly recommended to be applied to the version 5.9.3.0. If you do not wish to update the version to 5.9.3.0, there is a offline patch that I can share with you, if requested, so that you can apply it for older server versions (5.6.0.0 to 5.9.3.0).
