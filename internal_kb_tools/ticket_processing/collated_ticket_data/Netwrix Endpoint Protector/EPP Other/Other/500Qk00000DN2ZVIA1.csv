We are currently conducting a POC for a customer and have encountered an issue with log visibility. After applying the Content-Aware Policy, we receive notifications that files have been blocked by EPP. However, we are unable to view the corresponding logs for these actions.

Please investigate this matter.

Thank you.","","","","Issue was fixed by cust","","Adrian Stanca","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","45.1","Closed - Resolved","RoundRobin Tech Services","Nayan Rajore","2024-07-22T08:51:19.000Z","2024-09-05T10:34:16.000Z"
