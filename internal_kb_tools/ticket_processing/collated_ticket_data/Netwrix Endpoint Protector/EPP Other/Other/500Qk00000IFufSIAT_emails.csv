To stop the launch of the Brave Browser, create an Application denylist under Denylists and Allowlists >> Denylists >> Applications. From there create a new denylist, fill in what you want the name and description to be, then in the Application & CLI Command field type ""brave*"" without the quotations. Then, click Add to Content. On the right under List of Application & CLI Command, you will now see brave*, click the checkbox next to it so it is checked, then click Generate. Next, create a new custom Content Aware Protection Policy and after setting your Policy Name, Description, and OS, go to Policy Denylists and the Application tab, and from the dropdown select your Application Denylist you just made. Then apply this policy to your test machines and confirm it is working after closing any current Brave browser sessions. 

In the meantime, I am reassigning this case to someone in your time zone to better assist you if you have follow up questions.

Thank you,
Zachary Roy

Hi Zacharya Roy,

Yes, I understand your suggestion. However, in your scenario, Brave is
completely blocked, but what I need is to block file transfers and restrict
certain websites, similar to how restrictions are applied to other browsers.

Regards,
Naveen Kumar.

Thank you for reaching out!

For the moment we do not have the Brave browser added as an exit point for Linux OS . 

We can submit this ticket as a Feature Request to our Management team, to be implemented in one of our future release. 

Could you please let us know if we can continue ? 

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
