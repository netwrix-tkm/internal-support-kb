When we perform a manual update on one endpoint, it appears in the console, but the other disappears. This behavior keeps alternating between the two machines.

It seems that the agent registration is not consistent, and we suspect a possible conflict in identification or configuration.

Kindly investigate and do the needful to resolve this issue at the earliest.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-07T06:02:37.000Z"

Also, when they perform a manual update, the updated endpoint shows up and the other one disappears.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-04-07T09:19:02.000Z"
