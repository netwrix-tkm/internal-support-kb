Customer is: Turknet

Our client is going to renew his license and has some questions. Can you help?

The customer is using the On-prem version. If he wants to switch to SaaS version, how will the migration process take place? Should the configurations be rewritten? How much of the data will be kept in the cloud?

How does the traffic flow on the user computer? How does DPI behave when there is a proxy and VPN? Which traffic is prioritized? How should the certificate be distributed? The customer is using Symantec Broadcom Proxy WSS product. How is the relationship with this product? To which agent should the certificate be distributed? Does the traffic pass through the DLP agent encrypted or decrypted and encrypted again?

Best regards","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-11T11:55:46.000Z"
