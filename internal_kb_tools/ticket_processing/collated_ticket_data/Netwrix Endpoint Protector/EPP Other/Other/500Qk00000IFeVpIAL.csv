We tried before, but ran into some issues with the 2Checkout team. They made some requirements that we could not provide due to our mode of online payment; we are a fintech company, so we use virtual cards that are generated on a use-case basis. This means that we cannot supply the required information (payment/billing records, or authorization code from bank since there is no bank) to authenticate this payment. This has stalled the transaction and the payment attempt has expired. We wish to start anew.

I will be happy to jump on a call (Zoom or Google meet) to resolve this matter.
Please treat as very urgent.","","","","Case handed over to Sales for commercial proceedings.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","14.0","Closed - Resolved","Paystack","OSAYANDE OSAGHAE","2024-11-13T11:30:59.000Z","2024-11-27T11:22:04.000Z"
