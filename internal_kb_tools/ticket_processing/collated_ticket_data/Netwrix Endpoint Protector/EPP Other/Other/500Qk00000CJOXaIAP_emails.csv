Please test the scenario using the latest MacOS epp agent version 3.0.2.1007 available from 5.9.3.0 server UI. I recommend to test both with DPI disabled and enabled.
If the issue reproduces, I am providing the steps required to collect a set of epp debug logs while reproducing the issue on a MacOS client machine with DPI enabled:

1. Enable Debug logging option from server UI > Device Control > Computer Settings page :



2. Follow these troubleshooting steps :
 

3. Wait some time for the logs to be uploaded to the server, depending on your upload speed.
4. Go to server UI > Reports and Analysis - Logs Report, and filter for 'Artifact Received' event for that particular test machine.
    Download the latest logs and provide them for further investigation.
    If you do not see the logs yet, then it means the upload process has not finished yet, in which case please allow more time for the logs upload to finalize.

Thank you and Best regards,

After further analysis we have determined that this probably happens because you have enabled DPI on that MacOS machine without enabling also ""Intercept VPN traffic"" option.
Both of this approaches should resolve the issue :
1. DPI enabled + ""Intercept VPN traffic"" enabled

2. DPI disabled

Afterwards you may need to disable and enable again MacOS Stealth Mode in order for the change to take effect.

It looks like only on my machine Intercept VPN has been turned OFF. That sorted the issue on my end but I still do have a question. Is there a way to find all users which had this settings turned OFF into our environment? A report in this way would be very helpful for us.

Hi Alex,

You may go to Device Control - Computers and check which computers have 'Settings' column set to value 'Custom' (instead of default Global).
If you click on the column name it will order by values, so you can quickly find the entries with Custom settings.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Alin, 

 

It looks like only on my machine Intercept VPN has been turned OFF. That sorted the issue on my end but I still do have a question. Is there a way to find all users which had this settings turned OFF into our environment? A report in this way would be very helpful for us.

 

Thanks,

Alex

Hi Alexandru,

After further analysis we have determined that this probably happens because you have enabled DPI on that MacOS machine without enabling also ""Intercept VPN traffic"" option.
Both of this approaches should resolve the issue :
1. DPI enabled + ""Intercept VPN traffic"" enabled
or
2. DPI disabled

Afterwards you may need to disable and enable again MacOS Stealth Mode in order for the change to take effect.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Alexandru,

Please test the scenario using the latest MacOS epp agent version 3.0.2.1007 available from 5.9.3.0 server UI. I recommend to test both with DPI disabled and enabled.
If the issue reproduces, I am providing the steps required to collect a set of epp debug logs while reproducing the issue on a MacOS client machine with DPI enabled:

1. Enable Debug logging option from server UI > Device Control > Computer Settings page :



2. Follow these troubleshooting steps :
 

3. Wait some time for the logs to be uploaded to the server, depending on your upload speed.
4. Go to server UI > Reports and Analysis - Logs Report, and filter for 'Artifact Received' event for that particular test machine.
    Download the latest logs and provide them for further investigation.
    If you do not see the logs yet, then it means the upload process has not finished yet, in which case please allow more time for the logs upload to finalize.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin
