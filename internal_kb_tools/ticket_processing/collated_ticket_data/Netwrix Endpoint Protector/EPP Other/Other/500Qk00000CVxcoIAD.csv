We have noticed that no logs have been generated by the system since 27th of June. The policies work but nothing is being generated in CAP or via the File Transfer module.

Any idea what caused this? Please treat this as high priority as the logs being generated are critical to the business.

Kind regards,
Denis","","","","The logs are being sent to the server after the hotfix was applied.","","Emil Podar","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","36.3","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Denis Pasca","2024-07-01T12:19:48.000Z","2024-08-06T18:54:54.000Z"
