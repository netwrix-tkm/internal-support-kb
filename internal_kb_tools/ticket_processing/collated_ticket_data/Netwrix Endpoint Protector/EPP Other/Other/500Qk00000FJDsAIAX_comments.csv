This customer uses the Chrome browser from a different location than ""/Applications"". The logs show that we don't monitor it:


--- CODE ---com.cososys.eppclient: (Foundation) netext: New TCP flow: 105553122307456 - TCP com.google.Chrome.helper[{length = 20, bytes = 0xd06eb2fefaa16abbdc1a8b2ea9ebb31f19d78dd4}] remote: 142.251.175.94:443 interface en0

com.cososys.eppclient: (Foundation) netext: NOT MONITORED TCP app: , com.google.Chrome.helper
com.cososys.eppclient: (NetworkExtension) [com.apple.networkextension:] [Extension com.cososys.eppclient]: provider rejected new flow TCP com.google.Chrome.helper[{length = 20, bytes = 0xd06eb2fefaa16abbdc1a8b2ea9ebb31f19d78dd4}] remote: 142.251.175.94:443 interface en0
--- CODE ---

 This can be easily fixed by someone from the server team by adding the following process name for Chrome in the back-end:

--- CODE ---INSERT INTO cf_application_grouped (cf_application_id, name, code, channel, use_data_exchange_host_process, use_dpi) VALUES (*XXXX*, 'Google Chrome', 'com.google.Chrome.helper', 3, 0, 1);--- CODE ---


where *XXXX* should be replaced with the value returned by this query:


--- CODE ---
SELECT id FROM cf_application WHERE os_type=2 AND name='Chrome' AND code='Google Chrome';
--- CODE ---

@WaitingOnEngineer @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan this can be assigned to the server team and a new development task should be filed.
