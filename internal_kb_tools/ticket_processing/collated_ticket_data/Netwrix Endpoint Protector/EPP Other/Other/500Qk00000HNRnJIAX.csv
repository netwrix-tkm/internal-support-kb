I want to reassign the DLP license to new prepared set of 400 users, but when I remove one user, another automatically gets assigned. Kindly help me with this. So that assign license to specific users only.

Also, how can we provide license with the hostname excel sheet, instead going one by one.","","","","The customer confirmed that we can close the ticket after explaining him how the licenses are being assigned.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","-","14.1","Closed - Resolved","Renewbuy","Anil Kumar","2024-10-23T11:57:19.000Z","2024-11-06T13:19:09.000Z"
