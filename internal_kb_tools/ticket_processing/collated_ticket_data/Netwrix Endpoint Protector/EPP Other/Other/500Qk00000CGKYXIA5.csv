We have installed an Endpoint Protector (EPP) on several users via the Intune application remotely using an Intune policy. However, a few devices are not showing up on the EPP dashboard. When we checked manually on the user's device, the application was installed successfully.","","","","If the SetServerIP tool did not help to re-establish the connection between the clients and server then you will need to uninstall the EPP clients from those machines as they were deployed with incorrect configurations in Intune.  After uninstalling them you can re-deploy the clients, this time with the correct configurations in the Intune deployment tool.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","110.8","Closed - Resolved","Catchpoint India","Indu Shekhar","2024-06-25T11:08:08.000Z","2024-10-14T05:21:35.000Z"
