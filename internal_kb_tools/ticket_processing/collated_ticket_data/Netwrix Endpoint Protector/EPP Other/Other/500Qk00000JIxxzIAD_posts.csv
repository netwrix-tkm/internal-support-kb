So, This what they need a clarifications from your end.

We tried to explain the details but customer need some more information from EPP support team regarding this Quey/Issue.

Please connect over the remote session with client and clarify /resolve this issue/query.

Also, they are installed EPP client on some other machines but machines are not reflected on the EPP dashboard. So, we asked them to provide a remote access of the users machine.
