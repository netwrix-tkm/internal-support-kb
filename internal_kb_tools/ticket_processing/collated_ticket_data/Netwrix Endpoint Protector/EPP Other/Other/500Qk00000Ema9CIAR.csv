Just want to ask follow up question.
I am looking for the option to push install the new agent version but cannot find.
Will you able to help me on this? IF NOT possible and we need to go to each pc,  kindly share epp “uninstaller” for me to prepare gpo deployment.

Also i try to use same installer that use last night but still the icon is not appearing.

Appreciate your earliest reply.","","","","Customer confirmed it can be closed.","","Andrei Pop","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","MJB International / Al Masood Gas Turbine","Ojie Dayoc","2024-08-22T05:52:21.000Z","2024-08-22T11:12:27.000Z"
