Hi Alin, 

I hope you are well.

Can you please confirm with the customer if they could use the mount functionality available on server UI?

If not, then please raise this as a feature request on the product board.

Thank you,
Cristi

They have tried to mount it via the web UI of the EPP appliance.  They provided a screenshot showing that is not able to be mounted as a shared point / folder.  The device is recognized as a device and not as a shared folder.  Would it be possible to mount this via the backend of the EPP Appliance? can we give this a try in a remote session?","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2024-10-15T17:28:19.000Z","2024-10-15T17:28:19.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer

We are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)

No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server. 

If new format need to be supported it should be raised by Feature Request in Product Board, but in advance I need to admit, such request will be not processed. I recommend to adjust storage format to supported one. 

Request refused.
