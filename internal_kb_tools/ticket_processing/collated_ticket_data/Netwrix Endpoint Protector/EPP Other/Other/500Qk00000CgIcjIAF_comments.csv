What the development can do without logs?

After you will receive the logs please try to found the problem in logs or please try to search after some keywords to see where can be the problem.

Hi @Alex Puskas ,
I uploaded them to the escalated case in Salesforce, apparently they don't get transferred to ADO...
I uploaded them here as well.
Thanks,

hi @Alex Puskas 
We collected the logs, the end user could only join via phone call so I activated debugging from the server.
The eppsplitlog is not empty this time, but please let me know if it captured everything.
Thanks,
Boti

If you will open the mentioned eppsslsplit.log file (which is NOT empty) and you will search for:
-> 'error' -> NO found
-> 'fail' -> 203 founds (all the found entries in logs are:

Certificate verification failed, code: x80092013 (2148081683) (WinCrypt)


Certificate validation failed is happening when:

	 - 	other software is installed in computer (I hope you asked the customer about VPN, other DLP solutions, proxies?)
	 - 	something is bad in our code (if something is wrong in our code, probably all customers should have the same problem) - it is not the case


In 593 A LOT of cases were reported with certificate validation problem (the setting send from server side was wrong). A workaround for 593 patch was described in which you must to CHECK all the checkboxes and enable certificate validation

(please see the attached image)


This WORKAROUND was NOT applied. Why?
From received logs if you will open the netdlp_setting.json file and you will search for disable_peer_cert_validation, you will observe ONLY
""ignore Hostname"" was checked.

""disable_peer_cert_validation"" : ""hostname""



Please try to check all the checkboxes to DISABLE the certificate validation (mentioned image), because probably the epp agent cannot verify the fortinet client certificate (or other third party solution used by the customer).

Can you please try to install the latest agent from patch 594 and collect again logs?

This is happening only on few URLs or the customer had problems with entire browser?

After the mentioned fix, you mentioned the problem was solved? What they changed?

@WaitingOnEngineer

I don’t see anything wrong in logs.

Last time I put some questions related to this ticket:
1. this is happening only on the mentioned website (you tried to allowlist/whitelist?)
2. if they upgraded the server to 594, please be aware to “uncheck” the certificate validation
(as I mentioned before the problem was reported on server 593, in patch 594 it was fixed so the workaround should be back ported)
3. the epp client receives data from other applications and seems to work as expected

They uses any other third party solution? (vpn/proxy/antivirus: Kasperski...)
Please try to disable the applications (if there are) to see if will work as expected.
