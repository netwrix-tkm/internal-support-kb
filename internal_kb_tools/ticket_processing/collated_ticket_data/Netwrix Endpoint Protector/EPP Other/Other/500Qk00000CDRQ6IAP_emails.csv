Hi Team,

Thanks for reaching.

The issue is increased the license count not yet reflected in the admin
portal. Also, some of the system licensing has been repeated.
I would prefer a remote session for a better solution.

My time zone is UTC+05:30 (am located in India)
11 am to 6 pm am available for call.
