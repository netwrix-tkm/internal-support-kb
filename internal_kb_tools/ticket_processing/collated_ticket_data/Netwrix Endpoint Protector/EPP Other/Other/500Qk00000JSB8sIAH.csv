In the 5.9.0.0 update, I saw a new feature that ""Introduces a Command-line switch (environment variable in Linux) during EPP client installation to deactivate the CAP driver, streamlining installation when CAP functionality is not needed.""

I am using RHEL 8. I am unsure how to use the feature mentioned above. Could you guide me on how to use it? Or if there is any documentation available, I would appreciate it if you could share it with me.

Thank you!","","","","fixed","","Daniel Anton","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","10.0","Closed - Resolved","CoSoSys Korea","daehee kim","2024-12-13T07:32:09.000Z","2024-12-23T07:39:29.000Z"
