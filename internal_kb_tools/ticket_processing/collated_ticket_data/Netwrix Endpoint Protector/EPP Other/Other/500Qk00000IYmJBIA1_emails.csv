We have got another issue where memory sticks won’t encrypt even though the latest EPP (Netwrix) client is installed.

Any chance you could assist Mark on Friday? I have copied him in on this email as I’m off on Friday.

Hi Andrei,

We have got another issue where memory sticks won’t encrypt even though the latest EPP (Netwrix) client is installed.

Any chance you could assist Mark on Friday? I have copied him in on this email as I’m off on Friday.

Hi Mark,

If you could please stay on this call too, as Andrei from Netwrix support will need to remote onto your machine and check the EPP logs etc.

I’ve copied John and Abdul in on this email, if free then either Abdul or John can jump on the call too. I will give them an update.

Thanks,
Rijay

Hi Rijay. Just thinking about this. can you ask if Abdul or John is free at 10 to drop onto this call? Just from EPP portal point of view they may be in better position to answer any questions on this for example on policies etc.

Cheers

Hi Rijay. Just thinking about this. can you ask if Abdul or John is free at 10 to drop onto this call? Just from EPP portal point of view they may be in better position to answer any questions on this for example on policies etc.

Hi Andrei,



We have got another issue where memory sticks won’t encrypt even though the latest EPP (Netwrix) client is installed.



Any chance you could assist Mark on Friday? I have copied him in on this email as I’m off on Friday.

Hi Rijay. Just thinking about this. can you ask if Abdul or John is free at 10 to drop onto this call? Just from EPP portal point of view they may be in better position to answer any questions on this for example on policies etc.

Hi Andrei,



We have got another issue where memory sticks won’t encrypt even though the latest EPP (Netwrix) client is installed.



Any chance you could assist Mark on Friday? I have copied him in on this email as I’m off on Friday.



Thanks,

Hi Mark,

 

If you could please stay on this call too, as Andrei from Netwrix support will need to remote onto your machine and check the EPP logs etc. 

 

I’ve copied John and Abdul in on this email, if free then either Abdul or John can jump on the call too. I will give them an update. 

 

Thanks,
Rijay

Hi Andrei,

 

We have got another issue where memory sticks won’t encrypt even though the latest EPP (Netwrix) client is installed. 

 

Any chance you could assist Mark on Friday? I have copied him in on this email as I’m off on Friday.

 

Thanks,

Rijay

Apologies maybe I did not clarify. I did mean on top of myself being on the call. If one is free that would be great.  Cheers,

Hi Mark,

 

If you could please stay on this call too, as Andrei from Netwrix support will need to remote onto your machine and check the EPP logs etc. 

 

I’ve copied John and Abdul in on this email, if free then either Abdul or John can jump on the call too. I will give them an update. 

 

Thanks,
Rijay

Hi Rijay. Just thinking about this. can you ask if Abdul or John is free at 10 to drop onto this call? Just from EPP portal point of view they may be in better position to answer any questions on this for example on policies etc. 



 



Cheers

Hi All.

 

Yes, we are still seeing mixed results in the Edinburgh office when using a standard Kingston USB Traveller Device. I have updated Call ref 1201497 (sat in IS- IRT) with notes stating some customers are getting green and others are receiving orange when using the same USB. 

 

Kind regards
