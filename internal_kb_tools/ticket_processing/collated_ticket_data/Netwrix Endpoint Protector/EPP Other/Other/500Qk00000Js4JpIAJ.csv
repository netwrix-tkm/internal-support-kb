"500Qk00000Js4JpIAJ","00430672","Support Ticket","Mobileconfig file for macOS deployment needed","Prospect SEON (contact Richard Leonard Kirner - richard.kirner@seon.io) is running a POC of Endpoint Protector, and they need to test the agent deployment on macOS through JumpCloud. For that, they need a mobileconfig file for our solution that they had tried putting together but were unsuccessful (see attached).
They have about 300 macOS computers in production.
Can we please assist them by having one of our developers review the file, and check if it contains everything for providing the necessary permissions for EPP centrally, in order to not have their users grant permissions manually?","","","","Information provided.","","Andrei Pop","Request","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","63.9","Closed - Resolved","SEON","","2024-12-24T12:17:18.000Z","2025-02-26T10:58:29.000Z"
