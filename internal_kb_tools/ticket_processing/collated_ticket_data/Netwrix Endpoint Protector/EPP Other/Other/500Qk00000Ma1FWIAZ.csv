How are you doing?

When talking about hybrid work companies, where people are not in the office 100% of the time. Outside the company, the DLP would be incommunicado with the server, making it impossible to adjust some policies.

What would we do in this case? Is there a SaaS platform?","","","","If the employees that work at the office(on the company network) have no issue, but the employees that work at home have issues with the EPP client communicating with the EPP server, the issue may be that the EPP server IP is set to be an internal IP, which makes it reachable inside the company network(employees working at the office), but unreachable by employees that work from home. If they have VPN they should be able to reach the EPP server.","","Flaviu Moldovan","Question","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","AIQON Servicos em Informatica LTDA - MSP","Lucas Feitosa","2025-03-05T13:02:35.000Z","2025-03-12T13:08:33.000Z"
