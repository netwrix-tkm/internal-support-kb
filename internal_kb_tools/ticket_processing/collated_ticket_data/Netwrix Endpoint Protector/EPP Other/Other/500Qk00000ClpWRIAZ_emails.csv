Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Team,

We already set up the server based on your recommendation disk space; however, can you please explain why now again we increase the disk space?

When we increase the disk sapce how much GB of disk you recommend?

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:

	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Thank you for your email.
How many licenses do you have active?
As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:


	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hi Adrian,

We have the 200 licenses.
For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.
But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.
FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

We will have the call after the disk space was increased, as I will need to assign the extra space to the server.
Then, we will take a look on the server as well to see if we can do/clear some more space perhaps.
Do let me know after the space was increased, and we will sync and sort it out.

Hi Adrian,

 

We have the 200 licenses.

For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

 

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.

But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.

FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.

As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:


	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Team,

We already set up the server based on your recommendation disk space; however, can you please explain why now again we increase the disk space?

When we increase the disk sapce how much GB of disk you recommend?

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

 

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.

But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
How many licenses do you have active?
As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:


	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
How many licenses do you have active?
As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.

The steps are:

  1.  You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:


[X]



  1.  If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:

[X]



  1.  Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.


[X]



The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
We will have the call after the disk space was increased, as I will need to assign the extra space to the server.
Then, we will take a look on the server as well to see if we can do/clear some more space perhaps.
Do let me know after the space was increased, and we will sync and sort it out.

Hi Adrian,

 

We have the 200 licenses.

For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

 

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.

But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.

FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
We will have the call after the disk space was increased, as I will need to assign the extra space to the server.
Then, we will take a look on the server as well to see if we can do/clear some more space perhaps.
Do let me know after the space was increased, and we will sync and sort it out.

Hi Adrian,

We have the 200 licenses.
For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.
But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.
FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
How many licenses do you have active?
As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.

The steps are:

  1.  You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:


[X]



  1.  If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:

[X]



  1.  Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.


[X]



The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Thank you for your email.
Of course.
We have cleared up some shadow files from the server, in total of about 4 Gb in size, thu freeing space for you to set up the Audit Log Backup and for it
to properly run.
As mentioned, for the Audit Log backup to run you will need to have free space on the server available as at least the File Shadowing is.
So for 15 Gb of Shadows, for the Bacup to run, you need minimum 15 gb of free space.

But as mentioned, since you have about 200 users, I would set up an External Storage server and forward all logs there and you will never have space issues again,considering you only have a total of 41 Gb in size
which is quite low.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
We will have the call after the disk space was increased, as I will need to assign the extra space to the server.
Then, we will take a look on the server as well to see if we can do/clear some more space perhaps.
Do let me know after the space was increased, and we will sync and sort it out.

Hi Adrian,

 

We have the 200 licenses.

For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

 

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.

But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.

FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:


	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear

We already set up the server based on your recommendation disk space; however, can you please explain why now again we increase the disk space?

 

When we increase the disk sapce how much GB of disk you recommend?

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,
Alin

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
Of course.
We have cleared up some shadow files from the server, in total of about 4 Gb in size, thu freeing space for you to set up the Audit Log Backup and for it
to properly run.
As mentioned, for the Audit Log backup to run you will need to have free space on the server available as at least the File Shadowing is.
So for 15 Gb of Shadows, for the Bacup to run, you need minimum 15 gb of free space.

But as mentioned, since you have about 200 users, I would set up an External Storage server and forward all logs there and you will never have space issues again,considering you only have a total of 41 Gb in size
which is quite low.

Hi Team,

We already set up the server based on your recommendation disk space; however, can you please explain why now again we increase the disk space?

When we increase the disk sapce how much GB of disk you recommend?

Hello,

Our recommendation is to increase the hard disk space for the epp server, as based on your screenshot the main disk partition has only 41 GB.
Afterwards one of my colleagues who works on your timezone will get back to you in order to extend the disk partition so the server can benefit from the extra space.

Thank you and Best regards,

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
Of course.
We have cleared up some shadow files from the server, in total of about 4 Gb in size, thu freeing space for you to set up the Audit Log Backup and for it
to properly run.
As mentioned, for the Audit Log backup to run you will need to have free space on the server available as at least the File Shadowing is.
So for 15 Gb of Shadows, for the Bacup to run, you need minimum 15 gb of free space.

But as mentioned, since you have about 200 users, I would set up an External Storage server and forward all logs there and you will never have space issues again,considering you only have a total of 41 Gb in size
which is quite low.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
We will have the call after the disk space was increased, as I will need to assign the extra space to the server.
Then, we will take a look on the server as well to see if we can do/clear some more space perhaps.
Do let me know after the space was increased, and we will sync and sort it out.

Hi Adrian,

 

We have the 200 licenses.

For the Disk space increase I will check with my internal team and let you know ASAP.

 

As per your recommendation, We download and delete the old audit log backups.

But still that popup message is showing on the UI console.

FYR, I have attached the screenshot.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
How many licenses do you have active?
As a space increase, I would go with an  extra 50-100 GB for now.
The space can be increased from Cloud/VM, depending where is the server hosted.
After the extra space was assigned,we will need to have a call to allocate that space on the server side.
For the exact procedure of increasing the space, you will need to check internally.

Hi Dinakaran,

Thank you for your email.
It seems that you are making use of the Shadow files, which in time can get quite large.
So we need to set up an Audit Backup in place- but for that to happen, we need free space available at least as much as the Shadow files- which are 14 GB in this case.
So, to summarize:
1.We need more soace- either we remove files form the server, or we increase the disk space
2.You set up- and I will show you below how, and Audit Log Backup and after you have the files archived you can download and delete them straight from the UI

The System Maintenance-Audit Log Backup menu contains 2 important sections:
1)Make Backup – which represents the possibility to perform a One time backup
2)Scheduler in the 2nd part of the Audit Log Backup menu, which represents the possibility to recreate exactly as for the One Time Backup an Audit that will run periodically, at a frequency chosen by you.
 
The steps are:


	You will have to select what kind of logs you want to backup:

 

 
 


	If  you intend to delete the logs and backup them, in order not to fill up the server, you will have to leave the following unchecked:


 
 


	Select how old logs to backup (in the following screenshot I chose 1 month old – this means that all the logs older then 1 month will be removed from Server and transformed into backups).

Select the number of logs in one package (you can leave the default 1 mil, or go even higher);
Select format;
Choose if you would prefer to delete and backup Shadows too. We encourage to include them as the shadows occupy more space then the logs and are main cause for server space fill up.
 
 

 
 
 
The Scheduler  is very important and should be set from the beginning, in order to avoid situations where  the Server gets filled with logs. The Audit backup packages will be available for download in the list from the bottom of the screen.
After you download them, you can simply delete them from the interface, as they still occupy space on the server.
The period for finishing an Audit log Backup depends on the number of logs and on the database size. When the One time backup  is done, the message from the top of the section,“Currently an audit log backup is running” will disappear
