We hope you are doing well.

If the employees that work at the office(on the company network) have no issue, but the employees that work at home have issues with the EPP client communicating with the EPP server, the issue may be that the EPP server IP is set to be an internal IP, which makes it reachable inside the company network(employees working at the office), but unreachable by employees that work from home. If they have VPN they should be able to reach the EPP server.

Please let me know if the IP of the EPP server is a private one, or a public one.

Hi, there!

I'm sorry.
I did read your email and it makes totally sense.

You can close the ticket.

Sorry for the delay!
