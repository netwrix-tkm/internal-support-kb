Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your swift response.

For an audit we need to show a screenshot that we have a policy in EPP that ensures that encryption at rest is forced, and I am not sure where I can locate this evidence or proof.

So, I just need assistance locating proof of a setting or something showing that this is indeed evident.

Kind Regards

Checking our records, I noticed that your organisation is licensing the Enforced Encryption that is designed to encrypt data (using 256 bit AES CBC-mode encryption) stored on USB storage devices.

Full documentation on this functionality targeting data copied from computers to USB storage devices can be consulted using below link:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/EnforcedEncryption/Module.htm

 

The setup of the Enforced Encryption functionality can be checked inside the Endpoint Protector web interface under the Enforce Encryption > EasyLock

While the automatic deployment of the encryption application on USB Storage Devices connected to protected computers can be confirmed by checking the rights set for USB Storage Devices (Allow Access if Device is Trusted Device Level 1+):

Hi Daniel, 

 

Where can I see that data is data is encrypted using 256 bit AES CBC-mode encryption on the EPP web interface.

 

This is what I need to prove for the audit.

 

Kind Regards

 

Jovan Salsone

Hello Jovan,

Thank you for getting back to us.
 

Checking our records, I noticed that your organisation is licensing the Enforced Encryption that is designed to encrypt data (using 256 bit AES CBC-mode encryption) stored on USB storage devices.

Full documentation on this functionality targeting data copied from computers to USB storage devices can be consulted using below link:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/EnforcedEncryption/Module.htm

 

The setup of the Enforced Encryption functionality can be checked inside the Endpoint Protector web interface under the Enforce Encryption > EasyLock

While the automatic deployment of the encryption application on USB Storage Devices connected to protected computers can be confirmed by checking the rights set for USB Storage Devices (Allow Access if Device is Trusted Device Level 1+):


	at the global level: Device Control > Global Rights
	granular: Device Control > Groups/ Computers/ Users > right click on the entity > manage Rights 


Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,

Hi Daniel, 

 

Sorry for the late reply.

 

We currently do not have eDiscovery as part of suite. Is there any other way to find proof of encryption at rest?

 

Kind Regards

Hello Jovan,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

From your description, you are referring to the eDiscovery module, which can be found in the EPP UI, on the left side. 

More details about it can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EndpointProtector_5.9.4/page/Content/EndpointProtector/Admin/eDiscovery/Module.htm

Have a nice day ahead!

Hi Daniel,

 

Thanks for your swift response. 

 

For an audit we need to show a screenshot that we have a policy in EPP that ensures that encryption at rest is forced, and I am not sure where I can locate this evidence or proof.

 

So, I just need assistance locating proof of a setting or something showing that this is indeed evident.

 

Kind Regards
