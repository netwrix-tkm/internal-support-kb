"500Qk00000FfFH1IAN","00420788","Support Ticket","Auto Remove old USB devices","Good morning,

I was just wondering if there is a way to have USB devices that have not been connected for X amount of time to be removed automatically from Endpoint Protector ?

Reason being we recently had some issues with the performance of Endpoint and after working with your support teams it was because we had over 10K USB devices some that had not been connected in 3 years I went through and removed everything apart from anything that had been used in the last 3 months and we no longer have any issues, so if that could be automated that would be a big help.

Thanks
