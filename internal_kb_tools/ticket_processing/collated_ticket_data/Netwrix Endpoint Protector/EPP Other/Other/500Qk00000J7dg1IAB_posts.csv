In this support portal, when I select ""Report and Analysis Logs"" in Collector Code, the next option ""Feature"" is the required field. But I'm unable to select an option, when I click something, it does not list anything and is just highlighted in red.

Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-05T06:19:05.000Z"
