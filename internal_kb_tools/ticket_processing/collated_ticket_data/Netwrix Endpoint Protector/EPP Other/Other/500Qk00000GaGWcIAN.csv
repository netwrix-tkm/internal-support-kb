Our customer's request is as follows;

We need to update the External Storage Setting field on EPP.
We need to mount it by running “mount -t nfs -o ‘vers=3,nolock,rsize=524288,wsize=524288’ <a href='https://a1ecsnfsvh01p.igairport.aero' target='_blank'>a1ecsnfsvh01p.igairport.aero</a>:/ecs_nfsshare/EPP/ /path” on the server but we could not do it because it is an Appliance.
