Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?
Yes, we do.

Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?
In our company, we try to automate as many routine tasks as possible. Using Certbot will help automate periodic TLS certificate renewal.

What are you trying to achieve with this access?
Automating routine tasks makes it easier to maintain information systems and helps minimize the impact of human error. Timely replacement of TLS certificates will help prevent data loss from agents.

Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?
We want to install Certbot and the Certbot plugin for AWS Route 53 on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server (an EC2 instance in our AWS account). This tool should connect to AWS Route 53 to create a new TLS certificate and replace the old one. A cron job (the system daemon for scheduling tasks on Linux operating systems) will be used to run the utility periodically. More details about the installation and usage of these utilities are described in this article - https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557","","","","005Qk000001nViCIAU","2025-03-05T12:14:24.000Z"
