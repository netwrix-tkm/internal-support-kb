As requested we have updated the password for your username to: epp2011

Please let us know if it works now.

I believe the main issue here is that you have overwritten the root user with your account. I would recommend creating instead a separate account for yourself and renaming the current one to root(it can be disabled so no one can access/use it). The root account has certain exceptions for login that may cause issues if overwritten with user other admin accounts.

If you would like we can schedule a remote session next week and we can do these steps together.
