Our customer, Techtaka, has an EPP server set up on AWS with a T3.xlarge option and 500GB of storage. In the ‘Appliance > Server Information > Disk Space’ section, Disk Space System is currently set to 20GB, and Disk Space EPP Server is set to 71GB, both configured at a low capacity. The Disk Space System is using 15GB out of 20GB, resulting in a ‘Your appliance is running low on disk space’ message. The customer wishes for this message to be resolved. Please kindly refer to the attachment.

Therefore, we request remote support to expand Disk Space System to 50GB and Disk Space EPP Server to 450GB. 

If possible, could remote support be scheduled for Monday, October 28, and Tuesday, October 29? If these dates are inconvenient for you, we kindly request remote support in November (excluding Tuesday, November 5). The preferred time is 4:00 PM KST (10:00 AM Romania time).

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.



Best Regards,
Jack Jung","","","","Disk space expanded.
