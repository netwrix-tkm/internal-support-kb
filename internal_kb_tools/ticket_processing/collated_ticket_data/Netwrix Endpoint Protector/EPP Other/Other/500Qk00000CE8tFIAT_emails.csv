We hope you are doing well.

Please let me know if you have availability this week for a remote session and we will take a look together. Please let me know some days, time intervals and also your time zone.

We would also need access to one of the affected end users computers to take a look at the EPP client and maybe generate some logs.

Please also let me know the below:
1. Is the EPP server hosted on your end?
2. Is it hosted on a VM, Azure, AWS, GCP platform?
3. What types of logs does your SIEM solution support? Example: rsyslog, syslog-ng, etc.
