Eduard - thank you for the information.

I believe I have a problem related to this update. After applying the update on 7-1-2024 at 19:51EST, we now longer see detailed logs for ANY clients. See the example I provided for EVENT = CONNECTED, logs stop after the update.

The only log entraies for the past 8 days is: ""Policies Received""

Should I open new ticket, or can you help? I believe the update broke something (or the engineer forget to enable something, after update was applied).

I can help with this, no problem.
All logs that were not processed are stuck on the server and once the hotfix is installed, they will resume being processed.
Before we do this, I would be more comfortable if we create a snapshot before we apply that hotfix during a remote session.
Can you please see that a snapshot is created? Also let me know your timezone and availability and I will set the meeting up.

Wow, fast response. Thank you.

I will get a snapshot of the server. Does this hotfix require a reboot? (i.e., after hours + change management)

If YES, I will need to schedule for tomorrow evening, at the earliest.","Netwrix Support Ticket #414326 - RopesGray - Security Advisory Confusion? Do we need to update?","richard.michlik@ropesgray.com","Richard Michlik","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-07-09T20:51:21.000Z","true"
