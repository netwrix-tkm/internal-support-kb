We have deployed EPP in our on-premises instance. While we are able to ping the IP address, we are unable to connect to the console via the web. Although the frontend screen displays options 1 through 5 can be seen

If I restart the VM i can see an error ""failed to start A high <a href='https://per....er' target='_blank'>per....er</a> and a reverse proxy server.""

Unfortunately I cannot see attachment section here so if you email me on
<a href='https://dipesh.ramesh@pwc.com' target='_blank'>dipesh.ramesh@pwc.com</a> I can attach the error message

We do have support purchase for this application so happy to provide proof if require. Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-02T14:48:00.000Z"
