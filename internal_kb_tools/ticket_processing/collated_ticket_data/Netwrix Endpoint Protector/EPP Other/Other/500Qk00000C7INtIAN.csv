"500Qk00000C7INtIAN","00412555","Support Ticket","New Teams Not working","Hi,

We have observed that on some systems new teams is not working. Once the DLP is uninstalled from that system the Team application is running and when DLP is installed again the Microsoft Teams app won't run.

There is no such policy enabled to block Teams or any other application. Policies are only in Monitoring mode.

Kindly provide a fix for this issue. If you require any more details, you can connect me over this email id: <a href='https://akshay.amin@mobileum.com' target='_blank'>akshay.amin@mobileum.com</a>

Regards,
Akshay Amin","","","","no response","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","110.2","Closed - Resolved","Mobileum Technologies Pvt. Ltd","IT Team IT Team","2024-06-21T07:27:58.000Z","2024-10-09T11:57:19.000Z"
