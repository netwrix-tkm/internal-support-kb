"500Qk00000ECF9jIAH","00417624","Support Ticket","Remove an OHSU contact from your contact list","Hello,
You have ""<a href='https://service@ohsu.edu' target='_blank'>service@ohsu.edu</a>"" as a contact, so any support or change emails end up going to that mailbox. That is a mailbox we use for generating Jira tickets, so Netwrix emails to it aren't appropriate. Can we please get ""<a href='https://service@ohsu.edu' target='_blank'>service@ohsu.edu</a>"" removed from your lists?
Thanks,
Jacques","","","","account was removed","","Eduard Nut","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","84.1","Closed - Resolved","OHSU - Oregon Health & Science University","Jacques Perrolle","2024-08-08T20:08:11.000Z","2024-10-31T23:05:55.000Z"
