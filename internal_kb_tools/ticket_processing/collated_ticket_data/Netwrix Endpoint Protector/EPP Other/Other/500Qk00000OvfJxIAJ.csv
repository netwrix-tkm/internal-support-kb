"500Qk00000OvfJxIAJ","00444505","Support Ticket","Migration of appliance fro ESXi to Hyper-V","Hello,
We are planning to decommission our on-prem ESXi hosts so wish to use EPP on Hyper-V or potentially on Azure.

We initially tried a migration but the new VM is not connecting to the network.

The ESXi deployment was from your appliance so we wondered if there was a similar VHD deployment we could use to deploy new to Hyper-V?
