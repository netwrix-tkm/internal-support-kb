Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hey Aaron, I am not entirely sure as I haven't spoken directly to the end customer.

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hey Aaron, I am not entirely sure as I haven’t spoken directly to the end customer.

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Yes you can reference this ticket number in the new ticket, but please also add all the information that is needed in order for us to create the EPP UI login account for the admin: admin name, username, email, company, etc. We need this information in order to create the admin account for the user. We can also schedule a remote session with the admin and create and test the admin login account together.

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.

Hi Flaviu and Sara,

We got mixed answer from the previous MSP MCC.

Can you confirm if the account is transferred to Venture? And if MCC still have access.

It looks our customer doesn't know about this transfer and asked me to reach out to MCC first.

Thanks,
Aaron

Hi Aaron and Sara,

Please ask the customer to raise a separate request/ticket to create the EPP UI access account.

We would need some information like: Username, email, company, etc so we know exactly for who we create the access account.

We can also schedule a remote session so we can make sure everything is working okay for them.

Please let me know if I can close this ticket.

Hi Sam,

I believe Sara(here in CC) is waiting for the new company's details. Could you or someone from the new company reach out and provide those details?
In an earlier email, Sara mentioned she needs the contact for the new partner and their company information.

This was initially raised in ticket: 00428438 and the discussion around this was on the 12th of December 2024.
