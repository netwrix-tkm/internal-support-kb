I am getting back to you with the feedback received from R&D. 
We tested this exact scenario with a Microsoft Teams connecting over a web-proxy to the internet and DPI enabled, but no matter on how many systems we tried having different configurations, we could not replicate this issue.
As per this we would like to ask if it would be possible to get logs using a 6.2.2.1006 EPP agent where it worked correctly so we can compare it with the logs that were generated with the 6.2.4.0003 EPP agent. (if this is OK for you we can schedule a session for tomorrow).

Also we can recommend one more change which you can try to see if it makes a difference. You should change the custom port configuration for port 8077 from ""Proxy"" to ""HTTPS"" like in the following screenshot:
This can be achieved under Content Aware Protection > Deep Packet Inspection menu.



If the settings change doesn't fix the issue, and if based on the 6.2.2.1006 logs we can't determine the issues them we might need to schedule a remote connection where we will use Wireshark to capture network traffic.

Hi Adrian,

The problem happens with every client version.
When I said it worked earlier I meant before the server upgrade to the latest version.
Also changing the port to https doesn’t make any difference.

I would like to propose you a remote session for tomorrow, for which our Senior Engineer Manager of the Client team will participate so that we can try to help you with this scenario.
For the session we would require access to the User Interface of the EPP but also to a system where we can reproduce the problem and activate debugging logs + we will require to download and run Wireshark.

Would it be suitable for you to have the session from 2:00 PM Germany time?

Dear Benjamin,

I would like to propose you a remote session for tomorrow, for which our Senior Engineer Manager of the Client team will participate so that we can try to help you with this scenario.
For the session we would require access to the User Interface of the EPP but also to a system where we can reproduce the problem and activate debugging logs + we will require to download and run Wireshark.

Would it be suitable for you to have the session from 2:00 PM Germany time?

Hi Adrian,

 

The problem happens with every client version.

When I said it worked earlier I meant before the server upgrade to the latest version.

Also changing the port to https doesn’t make any difference.

 

Best regards

Benjamin

Dear Benjamin,

I am getting back to you with the feedback received from R&D. 
We tested this exact scenario with a Microsoft Teams connecting over a web-proxy to the internet and DPI enabled, but no matter on how many systems we tried having different configurations, we could not replicate this issue.
As per this we would like to ask if it would be possible to get logs using a 6.2.2.1006 EPP agent where it worked correctly so we can compare it with the logs that were generated with the 6.2.4.0003 EPP agent. (if this is OK for you we can schedule a session for tomorrow).

Also we can recommend one more change which you can try to see if it makes a difference. You should change the custom port configuration for port 8077 from ""Proxy"" to ""HTTPS"" like in the following screenshot:
This can be achieved under Content Aware Protection > Deep Packet Inspection menu.



If the settings change doesn't fix the issue, and if based on the 6.2.2.1006 logs we can't determine the issues them we might need to schedule a remote connection where we will use Wireshark to capture network traffic.

HI Adrian,

So far testing this for two days now and I don’t have any problems with Teams yet.
But by adding that to the DPI allow list we will not see files uploaded to Teams in the logs anymore right ?
