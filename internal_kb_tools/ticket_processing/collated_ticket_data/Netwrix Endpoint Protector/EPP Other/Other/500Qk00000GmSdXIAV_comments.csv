@WaitingOnEngineer

On how many machines does this issue reproduce? Since it is a macOS machine and DPI involved, you should check if the DPI certificate is properly installed and trusted. I found this in the logs:

""Integrity check failure: Certificate info: Â Certificate is in Keychain, but it is NOT trusted""

This should appear in the server side events also. Mark the certificates trusted and test again. If you still encounter issues, gather a new set of logs.
