Hi Anderi,


Could you kindly expedite the AMI upload process for SK D&D if it is possible?
We would greatly appreciate your support.
(As the year-end approaches, it seems our client's schedule is getting quite tight.)

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.

Hi Andrei,



Our partner, Datasecure, has checked the AMI shared by Filip, and SK D&D is ready for remote support.

Please kindly provide two schedules for remote support next week at 4 PM KST, Korean standard time (9 AM Romanian time).
Then, I will inform the customer, let them choose one, and get back to you.
(From now on, I will request AMI sharing directly from Filip and will only reach out to you for remote support.)

The remote support will be the same as usual, like below:


  1.  Licensing needs to be changed to “Legacy”
  2.  Internal HDD size of EPP AMI needs to be resized to the side of customer’s AWS resource where EPP AMI is on.
  3.  Optimize EPP internal variables to reflect the client numbers of the EPP AMI


I am looking forward to your two schedules.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.


Best Regards,
Jack Jung

Hi Andrei,



Our partner, Datasecure, has checked the AMI shared by Filip, and SK D&D is ready for remote support.

Please kindly provide two schedules for remote support next week at 4 PM KST, Korean standard time (9 AM Romanian time).
Then, I will inform the customer, let them choose one, and get back to you.
(From now on, I will request AMI sharing directly from Filip and will only reach out to you for remote support.)

The remote support will be the same as usual, like below:


  1.  Licensing needs to be changed to “Legacy”
  2.  Internal HDD size of EPP AMI needs to be resized to the side of customer’s AWS resource where EPP AMI is on.
  3.  Optimize EPP internal variables to reflect the client numbers of the EPP AMI


I am looking forward to your two schedules.

Have a nice day!
Thank you for your support.


Best Regards,
Jack Jung

Hi Anderi,


Could you kindly expedite the AMI upload process for SK D&D if it is possible?
We would greatly appreciate your support.

Have a nice day!

Hi Andrei,



I am sending you this email due to a specific request during today’s remote support.
Please kindly adjust the optimization for #3 to meet the A1000 standards: they use 350 clients, and this adjustment is to ensure sufficient buffer capacity.
1. Licensing needs to be changed to “Legacy”
2. Internal HDD size of EPP AMI needs to be resized to the side of customer’s AWS resource where EPP AMI is on.
3. Optimize EPP internal variables to reflect the client numbers of the EPP AMI

Kindly see you in Zoom!
Thank you for your support

Jack Jung
