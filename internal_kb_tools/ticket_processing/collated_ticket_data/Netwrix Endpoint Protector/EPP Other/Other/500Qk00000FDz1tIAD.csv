"500Qk00000FDz1tIAD","00419757","Support Ticket","EPP - Git commands delay","Hello,

A user has reported that they experience issues whenever they initiate Git commands. The user mentioned that the problem started arising since the new EPP update. Commands take a while to execute and it impairs them doing their daily job.

Here is the original message from the user: ""The endpoint protector has started to interfere a command line work with git after it's updated and the tray icon has been changed and it has started to be ""Netwrix endpoint protector""

Once per minute several git commands hang to 5-10 seconds which makes a regular work with git almost impossible. It blocks my work.

a log snipped is attached with 'git diff' command.

Other executables also hang, but this is a very frequent example.""

I will attach to the ticket the logs collected from their computer and also some logs from Git that the user generated.

Please investigate the matter and let us know of your findings.

Thank you.","","When git is enabled on the CAP it slows the users when they are using git.","The customer told us that the EPP Client causes slowness when users are using git commands.
Waiting for the customers to let us know the commands used by the users or to collect some logs if the issue will occur again.
The issue does not seem to reproduce, so I'm trying to close the ticket and ask the customer to reopen it if needed","Issue could not be reproduced with the latest epp client","Root Cause Unknown","Emil Podar","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","247.9","Closed - Resolved","The Stars Group Interactive Services / Flutter International","Denis Pasca","2024-09-02T11:40:54.000Z","2025-05-08T10:07:08.000Z"
