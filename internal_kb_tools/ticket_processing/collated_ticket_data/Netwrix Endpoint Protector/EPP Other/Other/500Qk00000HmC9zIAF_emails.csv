Thanks for the explanation.

However, the issue is that when we look at the console, we are only seeing
200 computers, when we have closer to 280+ online. See attached screenshot.

I understood now. This is caused by the assigned maximum records to be shown.
To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting the ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

Let me know after changing the value if you are seeing the correct number of computers.

Hi Johnathan,

As seen you have 350 total licenses and all 350 licenses are assigned. The online refers to how many computers are now online and licensed.
If you go to Device Control -> Computers you have a list of all computers that were at some point connected to the epp server, and there are also computers that are Licensed and offline, which do not appear on the System Licensing page, those also count towards the Total number of licenses and can be computers that are turned off right now but were online earlier.
Once a license is assigned to a computer, and if the computer is permanently disconnected from your network but the agent was not uninstalled from the console, the license needs to be released.
This can be done manually or you can set up the automatic license release which will remove the licenses assigned from computers that were last seen online longer than a certain period that you set.
You can set the automatic license release by going to System Configuration -> System Licensing and press View licenses

On the next page press Automatic release license from the bottom of the page.

Enable the automatic release, set the last online period, and press schedule.

After this, all computers that were offline for longer than the period will have their license released.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,

Hi Iman,

I understood now. This is caused by the assigned maximum records to be shown.
To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting the ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

Let me know after changing the value if you are seeing the correct number of computers.

However, the issue is that when we look at the console, we are only seeing 200 computers, when we have closer to 280+ online. See attached screenshot.

Hi Johnathan,

As seen you have 350 total licenses and all 350 licenses are assigned. The online refers to how many computers are now online and licensed.
If you go to Device Control -> Computers you have a list of all computers that were at some point connected to the epp server, and there are also computers that are Licensed and offline, which do not appear on the System Licensing page, those also count towards the Total number of licenses and can be computers that are turned off right now but were online earlier.
Once a license is assigned to a computer, and if the computer is permanently disconnected from your network but the agent was not uninstalled from the console, the license needs to be released.

Hi Johnathan,

As seen you have 350 total licenses and all 350 licenses are assigned. The online refers to how many computers are now online and licensed.

Hi Iman,

I understood now. This is caused by the assigned maximum records to be shown.
To increase the number of displayed items, please open the console and navigate to Device Control -> Global Settings


Scroll to the bottom of the page and set ""Maximum no. of records returned in a report search"" to the needed value. We recommend setting the ""No. of records per report page"" to 50 or lower to reduce the loading time. 

Let me know after changing the value if you are seeing the correct number of computers.

Thanks for the explanation. 
 

However, the issue is that when we look at the console, we are only seeing 200 computers, when we have closer to 280+ online. See attached screenshot.

Hi Johnathan,

As seen you have 350 total licenses and all 350 licenses are assigned. The online refers to how many computers are now online and licensed.
If you go to Device Control -> Computers you have a list of all computers that were at some point connected to the epp server, and there are also computers that are Licensed and offline, which do not appear on the System Licensing page, those also count towards the Total number of licenses and can be computers that are turned off right now but were online earlier.
Once a license is assigned to a computer, and if the computer is permanently disconnected from your network but the agent was not uninstalled from the console, the license needs to be released.
This can be done manually or you can set up the automatic license release which will remove the licenses assigned from computers that were last seen online longer than a certain period that you set.
You can set the automatic license release by going to System Configuration -> System Licensing and press View licenses

On the next page press Automatic release license from the bottom of the page.

Enable the automatic release, set the last online period, and press schedule.

After this, all computers that were offline for longer than the period will have their license released.
Let me know if you have follow-up questions.

Thank you,
Eduard Nut
