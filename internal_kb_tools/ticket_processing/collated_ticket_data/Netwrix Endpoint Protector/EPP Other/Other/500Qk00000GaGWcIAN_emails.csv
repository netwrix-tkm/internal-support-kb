Hello Yunus,

Would you be able to help us understand what do you mean by ""Another option is to give the space through Unity ... The settings we tried for Unity:""?
Can we confirm that indeed, the user and password of the Network Share input into Endpoint Protector Web interface are indeed, correct? Have you tried saving these for a second tim?

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Yunus,

I would like to provide you with an update we received from our R&D team.

Unfortunately we are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)   No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server.   We recommend to adjust storage format to supported one.


Kind regards

Hi,



Our customer provided the following response;



The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Another option is to give the space through Unity. But again we get an error when mounting. Can you ask about this?

Hi Yunus,

I would like to provide you with an update we received from our R&D team.

Unfortunately we are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)   No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server.   We recommend to adjust storage format to supported one.


Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I opened an internal ticket towards the engineering team regarding the compatibility of EPP with DELL ECS and I'll get back to you after that.

Hi,



Our customer provided the following response;



The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Best regards,
Alin Anca

Thank you for getting back to me.
Can you please let us know what Unity is more exactly in this example that you presented? I googled it but I'm getting multiple results: from servers to cloud.

Can we confirm that indeed, the user and password of the Network Share input into Endpoint Protector Web interface are indeed, correct? Have you tried saving these for a second tim?

Another option is to give the space through Unity. But again we get an error when mounting. Can you ask about this?

Hi Yunus,

I would like to provide you with an update we received from our R&D team.

Unfortunately we are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)   No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server.   We recommend to adjust storage format to supported one.


Kind regards

Hi,



Our customer provided the following response;



The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Thank you for your response.  The only change that I noticed is that the IP address is different in the second screenshot in the section ""Mount Point"".  This is pointing to a different location.
Also please see the email which I sent you on the 18th October regarding custom mounts. 

I do see that Dell Unity supports SMB you may need to modify the configuration on Dell Unity, are you able to authenticate with the same credentials from a Windows machine to that mount point?

Please also see Dell's article regarding the setup for Unity:

Can we confirm that indeed, the user and password of the Network Share input into Endpoint Protector Web interface are indeed, correct? Have you tried saving these for a second tim?

Hi,

 

Our customer asks;

 

Another option is to give the space through Unity. But again we get an error when mounting. Can you ask about this?

Hi Yunus,

I would like to provide you with an update we received from our R&D team.

Unfortunately we are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)   No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server.   We recommend to adjust storage format to supported one. 


Kind regards

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I opened an internal ticket towards the engineering team regarding the compatibility of EPP with DELL ECS and I'll get back to you after that.

Hi,

 

Our customer provided the following response;

 

The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

 

Best regards.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Best regards,

Hi Yunus,

Thank you for your response.  The only change that I noticed is that the IP address is different in the second screenshot in the section ""Mount Point"".  This is pointing to a different location.
Also please see the email which I sent you on the 18th October regarding custom mounts.

I do see that Dell Unity supports SMB you may need to modify the configuration on Dell Unity, are you able to authenticate with the same credentials from a Windows machine to that mount point?

Please also see Dell's article regarding the setup for Unity:

Setting up a host for SMB storage

Hi,



Our customer asks;



Another option is to give the space through Unity. But again we get an error when mounting. Can you ask about this?

Hi Yunus,

I would like to provide you with an update we received from our R&D team.

Unfortunately we are not supporting custom mounts. We only support WebUI integration with standard/format compatible targets (SMBv1/v2, FTP etc.)   No possibility to mount external storage through backend, as it will be not supported by further File processing by EPP Server.   We recommend to adjust storage format to supported one.

Hi,



Our customer provided the following response;



The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Hi Yunus,

Thank you for your response.  The only change that I noticed is that the IP address is different in the second screenshot in the section ""Mount Point"".  This is pointing to a different location.
Also please see the email which I sent you on the 18th October regarding custom mounts. 

I do see that Dell Unity supports SMB you may need to modify the configuration on Dell Unity, are you able to authenticate with the same credentials from a Windows machine to that mount point?

Please also see Dell's article regarding the setup for Unity:

Setting up a host for SMB storage

Can we confirm that indeed, the user and password of the Network Share input into Endpoint Protector Web interface are indeed, correct? Have you tried saving these for a second tim?

The storage we are using now is end of support. We are using DELL ECS as new storage. In order to use this space, we need to mount it to the server first with the command I sent you

As a use case scenario, we want the backups to be taken to this new area.

 

Best regards.

Hello,

Thank you for your email.
I would need to forward this request towards our engineering team to see if this is possible to be applied on the server side without disrupting some other internal process.
Can you please describe the use-case that you want to achieve? Why does the customer want to use this, for security concerns or just the fact that it's a NFS?
Is this for the files to get uploaded from the EPP server towards the External Storage, or is this meant to be from EPP client directly pushed towards the NFS?

Best regards,
Alin Anca
