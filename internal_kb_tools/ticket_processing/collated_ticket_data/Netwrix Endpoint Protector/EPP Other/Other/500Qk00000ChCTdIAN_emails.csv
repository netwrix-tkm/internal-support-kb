Thank you for reaching out to us.
I will add our colleague Oana to assist you with the renewal.
Oana, FYI

We are trying to get our licensing renewed for 1 year. Our reseller BCN (<a href='https://shaun.fielding@bcn.co.uk' target='_blank'>shaun.fielding@bcn.co.uk</a>) has been trying to get a quote but apparently cannot get a response. Our current license has expired already and we only have 18 days to renew before we lose functionality. Please can someone contact Shaun and get our license quote sorted?
