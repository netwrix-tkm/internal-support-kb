@WaitingOnEngineer

According to the logs, the EPP client manages to communicate with the EPP server. Settings/rights are received multiple times (maybe too many times). This should be checked by someone from the server team, the machine should be visible there as well, as long as it communicates with the server.

Hi,


1. Is it possible to change the computer's name so that it is not the same?

2. If not, Enable Virtual Desktop Clones Support:

	 - 	Go to the System Configuration settings page.
	 - 	Enable the ""Virtual Desktop Clones Support"" setting.
	 - 	Test the system behavior.


3. If the above doesn't work, collect logs from the registration process:

	 - 	Enable debugging logs on the server:

	 - 	Edit the file /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php using a text editor (e.g., vim).
	 - 	Set the following values:

	 - 	set DEBUG_VERBOSITY to 1017
	 - 	set DEBUG to true


4. Re-register the affected macOS machines.

	 - 	Collect the logs from the following location:

	 - 	/EPPServer/sieratool/log/WebServiceFree.log
	 - 	Disable logging once logs are collected:


5. Revert the changes made to /EPPServer/sieratool/webservicefree/webservice.php to disable debugging.


6.Â Provide the collected logs for further analysis.


Regards,
Augustina
