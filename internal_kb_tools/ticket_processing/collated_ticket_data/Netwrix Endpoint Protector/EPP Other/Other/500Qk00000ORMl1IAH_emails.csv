I am following up in regards of your inquiry.

First, in order to allow custom notifications, please go(just as a test currently) to the computer where you are testing on->Device Control->Computers ->Select the computer->Computer settings and enable Custom client notifications and then save:



After that, go to System Parameters->Device Types and Notifications -> Select  out of the default Device Control notifications one, in my example, I used the first (USB Storage Device - make sure it's enabled):



Then click on ''Enable Custom Notifications''.

Below that, you will notice a List of Default Notifications in different languages. 

Pay attention in what language your EPP server is adjusted from the top right where it says Welcome->Language-> check what language you have. It is important because depending on the language adjusted there, that's where you need to set up the custom notifications on.



In my example, it was in english, so I created a test custom DC notification and saved it:



This is for Denied USB Devices, so the result was the following:




Let me know if you have difficulties or if you require further assistance.
