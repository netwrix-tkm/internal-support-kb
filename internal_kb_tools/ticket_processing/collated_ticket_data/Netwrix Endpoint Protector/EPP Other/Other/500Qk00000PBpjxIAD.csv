Client is having difficulties with the way the logs are being sent through their SIEM.


Need to get access to their SSH as they re hosted by us.

16/05/2025
Checked the client's appliance as they're hosted by us and found some discrepancies with the syslogs.
Asked on the engineers chat about this as we saw errors in the syslog and Aaron Dunn said we need to look elsewhere to see the failure and asked if this has stopped working or if it ever worked.","15/05/2025
Will need more details.

Waiting for the approval.

Following up with the client to gather more details.","Client confirmed that the issue has been sorted out.","Backend Server Fix","Marian Ilies","Error","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","1.3","Closed - Resolved","Tata Consultancy Services","Chirasmita Patra","2025-05-15T06:47:55.000Z","2025-05-16T13:22:06.000Z"
