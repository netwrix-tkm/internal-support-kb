So does the EPP have SSH enabled?

Hi @WaitingOnEngineer,

I would appreciate it if you could confirm the Ubuntu version that the customer is currently using.

To address the OpenSSH vulnerability, the most recent patch should be applied if the customer is using Ubuntu version 22.
Find more details here https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6859-1.

Steps to apply:


--- CODE ---
sudo apt update
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends openssh-server openssh-client
--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
sudo systemctl restart ssh

--- CODE ---

If the customer has Ubuntu 18, there are no vulnerabilities, so there is no need to run any commands.
