Connected to the backend and removed the mailer file which had a couple of GB along with some older back up files and freed from 90 something % to 72.

Client had a syslog file which had around 12GB that they use to send to their SIEM but they did not want to delete it as they said the issue is on the SIEM side and they want to keep it.

Informed that since the file is too large, it will keep growing if they do not sort the connectivity out.

Client said they will try to sort it out and agreed to keep the ticket opened for another couple of days and they will let us know how it goes.","","","","005Qk000003xRAXIA2","2025-02-26T13:18:05.000Z"
