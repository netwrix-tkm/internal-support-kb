The engineers asked if you can let us know the exact git commands for which the problem appeared.
Would it be possible to send us the git commands which were causing these issues?

Hi Emil,

Don't have the command, will have to check if the user can provide it although he mentioned that he hasn't experienced the same issue since then.

Kind regards,
Denis
