I will ask internally about this vulnerability, ADV-2025-010 - Insufficient Computational Complexity in Key Derivation.

Please let me know your current EPP Server's version. This can be found in the bottom right corner of the EPP UI.

Here is the download link for the offline patch:
https://download.endpointprotector.com/offline_patches/EPP500675942.tar.gz

You can apply the patch accessing Dashboard -> Live Update -> Offline Patch Uploader -> select the patch (in the same format .tar.gz) -> Apply Update -> wait until you see the notification regarding the Offline patch being applied -> Click again on Dashboard -> Live Update -> And you can see the update process -> Once the patch is applied refresh the EPP UI and check if the server version is updated.

I will recommend you to take a snapshot of the EPP Server before you will apply the patch.

Best regards,
Emil
