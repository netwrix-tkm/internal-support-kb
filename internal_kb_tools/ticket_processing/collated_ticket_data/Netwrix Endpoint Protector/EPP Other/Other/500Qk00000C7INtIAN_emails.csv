Thank you for contacting our Support Department.

Could you please provide us more details regarding the issue encountered? 

When you are referring that the New Teams is not running , is the application stuck ? If you double click it is not opening anything ? 

What is the Operating System that you are using?  What EPP server / client are you using ?

Also, can you please share with us a short video with the issue?

Looking forward for your response. 

Best regards,
