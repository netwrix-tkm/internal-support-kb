We hope you are doing well.

The Vulnerabilities are usually patched from the following section:

1. Please go  to Dashboard -> Live Update
2. On the bottom of this page you should have Backend Security Updates:

3. Select either All Updates or Security.
4. Select Check Backend Updates and wait for the Search to finish.
5. Once it is finished Select Apply Backend Updates.
6. Wait for them to apply.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Good morning Flaviu,

I downloaded and applied all the backend updates as per your email, but the
issue is still there (CVE-1999-0524). Please advise what else can be done.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,
Bal
