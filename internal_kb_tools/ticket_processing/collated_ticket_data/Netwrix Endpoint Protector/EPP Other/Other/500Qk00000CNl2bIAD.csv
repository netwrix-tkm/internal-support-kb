"500Qk00000CNl2bIAD","00413295","Support Ticket","ADV-2024-002","We have updated our on-prem platform to the latest version and hotfix. To remediate that vulnerability, do we also have to update all the agents in our environment? The last time we chatted about the portal agent upgrade process, it was stated that the windows add-ons were no longer needed and were being retired. I still see those options in the portal. Since we are not electing to install those add-ons in our environment, are those still being included in what the Client Software Upgrades are pushing?","","","","server was upgraded to the latest version in ticket no. 419985","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","74.3","Closed - Resolved","Wolfspeed, Inc.","Tim Page","2024-06-27T15:49:15.000Z","2024-09-09T21:57:12.000Z"
