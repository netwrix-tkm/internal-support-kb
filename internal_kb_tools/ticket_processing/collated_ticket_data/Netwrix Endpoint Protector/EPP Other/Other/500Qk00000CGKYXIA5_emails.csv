Thank you for contacting our Support Department.

Are you able to connect on those endpoints and perform the following commands: 
ping IP of the EPP server
telnet IP of the EPP server

What messages do you receive after you run the commands? 

What is the client version that you installed on the machines ? 

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

I executed the commands but failed to connect to the EPP server IP .  
Installed agent version: 6.2.2.1.006

However, after manually reinstalling the EPP agent, it is now functioning correctly. Our Intune policy is designed to deploy the EPP agent, yet it seems to be ineffective when distributed through Intune. 

Please review the following information. Should you desire a call, kindly arrange a time between 10 AM and 8 PM IST.

Could you please provide us the error that you receive while you tried to run the commands? 

If there is a communication issue, most likely this will affect the INTUNE deployment.

The connection time out means that there was no answer from the server. 

Could you please use also this command telnet IP of the EPP server 443 ?

Let us know the outcome.

Thank you for getting back to us. 

In that case, it seems that there is a misconfiguration when that EPP client was deployed, or the client didn't install correctly.

To check if the client is communicating with the server you can follow the next steps: 

	open the epp client 
	navigate to Settings menu
	press CTRL + ALT + I keys from your keyboard

If you do not see any results, that means there is an issue with the communication.

Looking forward for your response.

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we have checked how the Intune process is made and that the endpoints are installed but they do not receive the server name and the port due to a DNS issue. 

Please check on the other machines as well and let us know if all of them have the same issue.

Looking forward for your response.

In that case, it seems that there is a misconfiguration when that EPP client was deployed, or the client didn't install correctly.

To check if the client is communicating with the server you can follow the next steps:

Hi Daniel,

I wanted to provide an update on the current situation regarding Intune policies. Upon checking with other devices, I have found that the policies are working correctly on Mac devices. However, the same policies do not seem to be effective on Windows devices.

We do not believe this issue is related to DNS, as we have ensured that the epp domain and URL are allowed through our proxy.

I would appreciate any guidance or support you can provide to help resolve this issue.

Thank you for your prompt response.

Could you provide us the eppclient.log file from the computer that we have collected the logs while were in the remote session ? 

We would like to investigate it.

Looking forward for your response.

Hi Daniel,

I wanted to provide an update on the current situation regarding Intune policies. Upon checking with other devices, I have found that the policies are working correctly on Mac devices. However, the same policies do not seem to be effective on Windows devices.

We do not believe this issue is related to DNS, as we have ensured that the epp domain and URL are allowed through our proxy.

I would appreciate any guidance or support you can provide to help resolve this issue.

Thanks,
Indu","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #412902 - Host is not syncing with EPP portal.    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0CGKYX:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","ishekhar@catchpoint.com","","","false","2024-07-09T13:33:05.000Z","true"

Thank you for your email.
We are aware of the issue, where even after applied the hotfix lingers in the list of available updates.
You can disregard this for now, it will be fixed and if applied the update will be gone coming the next server version release.
