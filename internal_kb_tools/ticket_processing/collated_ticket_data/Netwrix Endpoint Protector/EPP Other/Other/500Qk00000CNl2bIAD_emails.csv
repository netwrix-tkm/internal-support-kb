In order to fully fix the vulnerability, you will need to upgrade the EPP clients as well.
Are you using an MDM tool to install the clients on your endpoints?

In that case, when you deploy the new agent, the following is the parameter you need to add to the msiexec command: ""INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=0""

For example: ""msiexec /i EPPClientSetup_6.2.1.2001.msi WSIP=demo.endpointprotector.com INSTALL_OUTLOOK_EXT=0"" as an atribute

Netwrix has received reports that following the deployment of CoSoSys Endpoint Protector Hotfix #1 the system may cease to process certain events. Netwrix has confirmed this behavior and is working on a revision to Hotfix #1 to resolve this issue. As a precaution, Netwrix has temporarily paused distribution of the hotfix until a replacement is available.
Customers who have deployed Hotfix #1 and are experiencing an issue with processing events should contact the Netwrix support team.
Regarding the agents, please let me know what your server version is.
