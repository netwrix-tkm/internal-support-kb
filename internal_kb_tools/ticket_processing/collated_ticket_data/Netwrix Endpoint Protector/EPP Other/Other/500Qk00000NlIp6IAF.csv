"500Qk00000NlIp6IAF","00441093","Support Ticket","Issue with EPP Agent Reflection on VDI Endpoints","We have installed the EPP agent on two VDI endpoints; however, we are encountering an issue where only one endpoint is reflected in the management console at a time.

When we perform a manual update on one endpoint, it appears in the console, but the other disappears. This behavior keeps alternating between the two machines.

It seems that the agent registration is not consistent, and we suspect a possible conflict in identification or configuration.

Kindly investigate and do the needful to resolve this issue at the earliest.","","Client has two VDI's where they installed the EPP agent and somehow they can only see one at a time and not both.

Also, when they perform a manual update, the updated endpoint shows up and the other one disappears.","Will ask for recommendations internally.","Closing ticket as resolved.
Client enabled the clones VDI.","","Marian Ilies","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Schwing Stetter India Pvt Ltd","Muthamil Selvan M","2025-04-07T06:02:35.000Z","2025-04-08T10:56:19.000Z"
