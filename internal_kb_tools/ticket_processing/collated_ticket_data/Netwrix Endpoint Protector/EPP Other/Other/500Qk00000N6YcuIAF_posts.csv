We are experiencing an issue that I have encountered before, and now another user in the system is facing the same problem.

The user logs into the system using a local account. After logging in, the system prompts them to change their password. However, this action is not possible. When the user copies their current password into the required field, the system responds with an error stating that the password is incorrect.

However, the password is correctâ€”it is the same one the user successfully used to log in, as shown in the attached screenshot.

Could you please advise on why this is happening and how to resolve it?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-19T16:04:22.000Z"
