@WaitingOnEngineer There is no mention on the OS for this issue and also no logs attached, but I can explain what is the normal/expected behavior with OCR. When the user tries to send an image the EPP client has two options. The first one is to use the extracted text content of the image saved in the local database. In this particular case obviously there will be no extracted content since we are dealing with a new image. In this case, the EPP client will have to perform OCR on the spot. This can take between a few seconds and even minutes sometimes. In this time, the transfer is not allowed. When OCR is done, if the file has not threats, next attempt to upload the file will be allowed. With the info I have so far, to me it seems that this is the scenario in your case. Because you mentioned that after a few upload attempts the file is allowed. If this is the case, there is nothing that we can do for the customer. Tell him this will usually happen only with new files.

@WaitingOnEngineer 

Alin, the logs are visible now. And my supposition from the previous comment was correct. The EPP client does not finish with OCR in the max waiting time (set to 9 seconds) and the file is automatically blocked. So, I say you go back to the customer and explain the situation. Again, as mentioned, this happens mostly for new files and if the customer waits a little bit, finally the file will be transferred.
