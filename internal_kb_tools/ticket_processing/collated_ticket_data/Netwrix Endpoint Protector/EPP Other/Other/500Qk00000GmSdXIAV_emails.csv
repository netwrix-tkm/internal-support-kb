Can you please let me know if the issue can be still reproduced?

Hello Csilla,

From what we could see on the logs, it seems that the DPI certificate is imported in the keychain but it is not marked as trusted.
Please try to install the following EPP Client and try to reimport the DPI certificate and mark it as trusted.
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1001.Notarized.tar

Let me know if the issue can be still reproduced.

Hello Csilla,

Can you please let me know if the issue can be still reproduced?
As from the client logs my colleagues could see that the DPI certificate was imported in the keychain on the Mac but it was not marked as trusted.

Thank you,
Emil

Hello Csilla,

From what we could see on the logs, it seems that the DPI certificate is imported in the keychain but it is not marked as trusted.
Please try to install the following EPP Client and try to reimport the DPI certificate and mark it as trusted.
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25102024/EPPMac3.0.4.1001.Notarized.tar
https://download.endpointprotector.com/custom_agent/Epp25102024/EPPClient_v6.2.4.1001.zip

Let me know if the issue can be still reproduced.

Best regards,
Emil

Please find attached the collected logs from the affected machine.

I would like to mention that after installing the agent that you provide, the computer was working properly, but the next day the problem reappeared.

Thank you very much!
