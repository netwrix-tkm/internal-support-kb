Thank you for contacting us.

I am attaching to this e-mail an archive that contains a vb script which should uninstall the client from the machine.

You are going to need to run the script from CMD as an administrator. Please make sure the CMD is running as an admin as below:


Also I am also attaching a screen recording on how to perform that.

Please try to follow the instructions and let me know if the client is uninstalled successfully.

Looking forward to your response.
