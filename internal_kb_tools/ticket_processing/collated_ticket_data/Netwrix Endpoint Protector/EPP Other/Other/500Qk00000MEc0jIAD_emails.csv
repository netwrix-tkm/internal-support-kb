Dear André

 

I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.


	Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?

	
		Yes, we do.
	
	
	Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?
	
		In our company, we try to automate as many routine tasks as possible. Using Certbot will help automate periodic TLS certificate renewal.
	
	
	What are you trying to achieve with this access?
	
		Automating routine tasks makes it easier to maintain information systems and helps minimize the impact of human error. Timely replacement of TLS certificates will help prevent data loss from agents.
	
	
	Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?
	
		We want to install Certbot and the Certbot plugin for AWS Route 53 on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server (an EC2 instance in our AWS account). This tool should connect to AWS Route 53 to create a new TLS certificate and replace the old one. A cron job (the system daemon for scheduling tasks on Linux operating systems) will be used to run the utility periodically. More details about the installation and usage of these utilities are described in this article -  https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557
	
	


Thank you in advance.

Dear Bogdan,

I have discussed your request / requirement internally. 

We can provide you with a secondary account (your own credentials) for SSH root access to the backend of the Endpoint Protector Server Appliance.  However when we provide you with your own root credentials you will need to perform the procedure yourself as this will not be within our support scope.  The changes that you will then make are changes that we did not test with our product.  We will not be held liable in case anything goes wrong and negatively impacts your Endpoint Protector Server Appliance.

If you wish to proceed then a request can be made to obtain your own root credentials but this will need to be qualified by our legal department.  A legal document (agreement) will need to be signed by Netwrix and by the representative of your organization, when this request has been approved by our legal team then only can we create your own root user however to do this we will need to access the backend of your EPP Server at least once to create your own root user.

In your response could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions that our Legal department will require please?


	Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?
	Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?
	What are you trying to achieve with this access?
	Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?

Yes, it will be a good feature.

 

Also, there was a question in a past email that I didn't get an answer to. 

Are we allowed to make changes inside an EC2 Netwrix sever instance?

Hi Bogdan,

Thank you for your response.  Currently we do not yet have the functionality to enable automatic SSL certificate renewal via integration or directly from the Cososys Endpoint Protector console.  The manual way is the only current way of rotating certificates, however we would like to know if you would like us to raise this as a potential improvement suggestion to PM for the future?

Thanks for the information!

 

Our DevOps team also suggests configuring Certbot with a plugin for AWS Route53. (https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557). We use this software to automate certificate rotation.

 

Can we go into the Netwrix EC2 server instance system shell (using AWS SSM) and make the necessary configuration changes?

Dear Bogdan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

You can import your own certificate under ""Appliance"" > "" Server Maintenance"". This will allow for secured connection between the end computer and the EPP Server UI.




I hope this information helps, please do let me know if you have any follow up questions.

Hello André!

Thank you for your reply!

I would like to clarify one more option for solving the problem. Can we deploy nginx proxy in our AWS account in a separate instance and install the auto certificate change software on it? Would you be able to help with proper nginx configuration?

Dear Bogdan,

I have discussed your request / requirement internally. 

We can provide you with a secondary account (your own credentials) for SSH root access to the backend of the Endpoint Protector Server Appliance.  However when we provide you with your own root credentials you will need to perform the procedure yourself as this will not be within our support scope.  The changes that you will then make are changes that we did not test with our product.  We will not be held liable in case anything goes wrong and negatively impacts your Endpoint Protector Server Appliance.

If you wish to proceed then a request can be made to obtain your own root credentials but this will need to be qualified by our legal department.  A legal document (agreement) will need to be signed by Netwrix and by the representative of your organization, when this request has been approved by our legal team then only can we create your own root user however to do this we will need to access the backend of your EPP Server at least once to create your own root user.

In your response could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions that our Legal department will require please?


	Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?
	Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?
	What are you trying to achieve with this access?
	Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?



Kind regards

Yes, it will be a good feature.

 

Also, there was a question in a past email that I didn't get an answer to. 

Are we allowed to make changes inside an EC2 Netwrix sever instance?

Hi Bogdan,

Thank you for your response.  Currently we do not yet have the functionality to enable automatic SSL certificate renewal via integration or directly from the Cososys Endpoint Protector console.  The manual way is the only current way of rotating certificates, however we would like to know if you would like us to raise this as a potential improvement suggestion to PM for the future?

Thanks for the information!

 

Our DevOps team also suggests configuring Certbot with a plugin for AWS Route53. (https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557). We use this software to automate certificate rotation.

 

Can we go into the Netwrix EC2 server instance system shell (using AWS SSM) and make the necessary configuration changes?

Dear Bogdan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

You can import your own certificate under ""Appliance"" > "" Server Maintenance"". This will allow for secured connection between the end computer and the EPP Server UI.




I hope this information helps, please do let me know if you have any follow up questions.

Kind regards

Hello Bogdan,

Thank you for your email. Unfortunately custom configurations to the nginx is not within our support scope.   The only time that we do configure the nginx is when the customer wants to do port separation between the EPP Server UI and the client to server communication.

Hello André!

 

Thank you for your reply! 

 

I would like to clarify one more option for solving the problem. Can we deploy nginx proxy in our AWS account in a separate instance and install the auto certificate change software on it? Would you be able to help with proper nginx configuration?

Dear André

 

I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.


	Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?



	
	
		Yes, we do.
	
	



	Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?



	
	
		In our company, we try to automate as many routine tasks as possible. Using Certbot will help automate periodic TLS certificate renewal.
	
	



	What are you trying to achieve with this access?



	
	
		Automating routine tasks makes it easier to maintain information systems and helps minimize the impact of human error. Timely replacement of TLS certificates will help prevent data loss from agents.
	
	



	Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?



	
	
		We want to install Certbot and the Certbot plugin for AWS Route 53 on the Netwrix Endpoint Protector Server (an EC2 instance in our AWS account). This tool should connect to AWS Route 53 to create a new TLS certificate and replace the old one. A cron job (the system daemon for scheduling tasks on Linux operating systems) will be used to run the utility periodically. More details about the installation and usage of these utilities are described in this article -  https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557

A legal document (agreement) will need to be signed by Netwrix and by the representative of your organization, when this request has been approved by our legal team then only can we create your own root user however to do this we will need to access the backend of your EPP Server at least once to create your own root user.

In your response could you also provide us with the answers to the below questions that our Legal department will require please?

  1.  Do you want to receive access to your EPP server backend ?
  2.  Can you please confirm why you need SSH access to the server?
  3.  What are you trying to achieve with this access?
  4.  Could you please provide us more details regarding this case?

Kind regards

Yes, it will be a good feature.

Also, there was a question in a past email that I didn't get an answer to.
Are we allowed to make changes inside an EC2 Netwrix sever instance?

Hi Bogdan,

Thank you for your response.  Currently we do not yet have the functionality to enable automatic SSL certificate renewal via integration or directly from the Cososys Endpoint Protector console.  The manual way is the only current way of rotating certificates, however we would like to know if you would like us to raise this as a potential improvement suggestion to PM for the future?


Kind regards

Thanks for the information!

Our DevOps team also suggests configuring Certbot with a plugin for AWS Route53. (https://timamtalukdar.medium.com/lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-route53-nginx-centos-rhel-7-27922b406557). We use this software to automate certificate rotation.

Can we go into the Netwrix EC2 server instance system shell (using AWS SSM) and make the necessary configuration changes?

Dear Bogdan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support support.

You can import your own certificate under ""Appliance"" > "" Server Maintenance"". This will allow for secured connection between the end computer and the EPP Server UI.

I hope this information helps, please do let me know if you have any follow up questions.

Kind regards
