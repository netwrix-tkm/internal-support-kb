For that, they need a mobileconfig file for our solution that they had tried putting together but were unsuccessful (see attached).
They have about 300 macOS computers in production.
Can we please assist them by having one of our developers review the file, and check if it contains everything for providing the necessary permissions for EPP centrally, in order to not have their users grant permissions manually?","","","","005Qk000001nVjyIAE","2024-12-24T12:17:19.000Z"
