I asked the engineers about this issue and I got the following explanations:
For the first screenshot, the threat reported is probably the same (even though we can't see it entirely, since it is obfuscated), but it is reported from different files (sharedstrings.xml and sheet12.xml).
We are aware of this limitation and we will try to handle it in the future.

As for the second screenshot, we can see that the reported file is exactly the same.
In this case, we suspect that the reported threat is not the same. We canâ€™t say this for sure (since the threat is obfuscated), but this could be checked on your side, if you have access to the file which was sent. You will have to look in the file and check if the 2 bank accounts are the same or different.
Let us know if the data sets which were reported are the same or if they are different. If they are the same, there might be an issue on our side.

Best regards,
Emil

Hi Emil,

I am unable to view any of the log details for the older alerts on the portal (see screenshot attached). Is it something that you'd be able to check at your end?

I am sorry for the late reply. I was out of office last week.
Can we have a sync tomorrow? If yes at what time would it be suitable for you?

Looking foward for you sharing your availability for tomorrow so I can jump in a session with you.

Sure! I will send you a calendar invite for tomorrow from 10:00 AM your time. 
It would be useful if we can have access to one of the users where these logs are being duplicated - to see without obfuscation if indeed we are talking about duplicated logs or not.

HI Adrian, 

Would it be alright if I try to replicate the issue on my own system? The user may not be able to allocate time for the session.

Thanks
