Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we could not access the backend of the EPP server, due to connectivity issues.
Please discuss with your network team, or your cloud team to allow the SSH access for the EPP server.

Once it is allowed, we can schedule a new session and reset the password.

Have a nice day ahead!

Hello Dinakaran,

Thank you for your time in today's session.

In the meeting we could not access the backend of the EPP server, due to connectivity issues.
Please discuss with your network team, or your cloud team to allow the SSH access for the EPP server.

Once it is allowed, we can schedule a new session and reset the password.

Have a nice day ahead!

Best regards,
