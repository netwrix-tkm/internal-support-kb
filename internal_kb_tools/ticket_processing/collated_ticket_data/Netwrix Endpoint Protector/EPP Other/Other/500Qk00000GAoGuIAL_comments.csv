@WaitingOnEngineer

Does it happen all the time? On all browsers? Did they try to restart the browser? I just checked and in my case it is ok. Tell them to retest and make sure the browser is restarted after DPI gets enabled. If the issue still reproduces, get some logs and maybe also a small recording of the issue reproducing.

@WaitingOnEngineer I was suspecting this. In that case, you can close this entry. It was just some sort of caching and the correct certificate was not displayed by the browser until a restart.
