I tested this exact scenario with a Microsoft Teams connecting over a web-proxy to the internet and DPI enabled, but I could not replicate this issue.

I know it might sound strange, but can we please get logs using a 6.2.2.1006 EPP agent where it worked correctly so we can compare it with the logs that were generated with the 6.2.4.0003 EPP agent.

I could not pinpoint any change made in our code between 6.2.2.1006  and 6.2.3.1010 that might impact this functionality.

We can recommend one more change that our customer can try to see if it makes a difference. They should change the custom port configuration for port 8077 from ""Proxy"" to ""HTTPS"" like in this linked screenshot:

If the settings change doesn't fix the issue, and if based on the 6.2.2.1006 logs we can't determine the issues them we might need to schedule a remote connection where we will use Wireshark to capture network traffic. @WaitingOnEngineer

""The problem happens with every client version.
When I said it worked earlier I meant before the server upgrade to the latest version.
Also changing the port to https doesn’t make any difference.""

Please let me know how to proceed.","005Qk000001nViDIAU","2024-11-21T09:55:04.000Z","2024-11-21T09:55:04.000Z","false","false"

We're still investigating this issue, however while we're still investigating can you please ask the customer to add a DPI allow-list entry:

--- CODE ---
*.relay.teams.microsoft.com
--- CODE ---

and see if that makes a difference. FYI @WaitingOnEngineer

The customer got back to us saying that after 2 days of testing he did not encounter the problem anymore after he whitelisted :   
*.relay.teams.microsoft.com 

I will inform the customer that *.relay.teams.microsoft.com is a helper domain used by Microsoft Teams for customers that use network proxies, allow-listing this domain should not affect the scanning functionality of Endpoint Protector.","005Qk000001nViDIAU","2024-12-04T08:50:50.000Z","2024-12-04T08:50:50.000Z","false","false"

@WaitingOnEngineer because we are not able to replicate this issue in-house, as it depends on the customer's exact proxy setup, we can consider allow-listing the


--- CODE ---*.relay.teams.microsoft.com--- CODE ---
 domain as the solution and close this case. We can document this, just in case we run into similar issues in the future.
