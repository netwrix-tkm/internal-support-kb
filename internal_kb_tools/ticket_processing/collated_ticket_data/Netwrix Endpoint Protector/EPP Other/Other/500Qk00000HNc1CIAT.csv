"500Qk00000HNc1CIAT","00424827","Support Ticket","License scavenging / removal of old devices","Hi, we have looked through the options within the system Web UI and also have checked your documentation but have not found an answer. The questions below relate to licensing and stale/offline devices.

We are licensed for 1000 computers, does the system automatically remove devices that have not contacted the server within a set period? If so, how long does a device need to be offline before it is removed? Can this time limit be changed?

Are licenses only assigned if a computer is showing as 'Online' within the tool?","","","","THe customer confirmed that we can close the ticket after I replied to his questions regarding to licensing.","","Adrian Draghici","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","5940","1.7","Closed - Resolved","Senedd","","2024-10-23T13:18:31.000Z","2024-10-25T07:12:37.000Z"
