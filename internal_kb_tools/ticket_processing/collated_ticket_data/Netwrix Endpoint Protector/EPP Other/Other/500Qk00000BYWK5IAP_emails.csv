Hello,

1. The Endpoint Protector Server works with Azure AD and OKTA SSO.
2. In the CAP policy please select the FTP option in the Policy Exit Points.
3. Check in the CAP policy if the app is present in the exit points list. If it is and you select it the Epp client can scan the files going out through the app.

Kind regards

Hello Team,

During a demo session, a customer inquired if it is possible to block file sharing via mobile applications like Xender and similar apps. The customer is connecting a laptop to their mobile phone using Wi-Fi and utilizing file sharing apps like Xender/ShareIt. By entering the IP address of the phone in the URL box of any browser, they are able to share files between the laptop and the mobile device. Can we prevent this file sharing?

Thanks & Regards
