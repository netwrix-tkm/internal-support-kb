Hi @Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan @Flaviu Moldovan 

It's possible that this information disclosure happens only on our old Ubuntu 18.04 appliances, due to the way the older kernel handles these ICMP requests.

But whether it only applies to those or also to Ubuntu 22.04 ones, an iptables rule can be added in /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file that would block either all incoming ICMP requests, or only incoming ICMP timestamp requests. In this way, their concern could be solved.

ICMP can be blocked entirely by adding this line inside /etc/iptables/rules.v4 immediately after the other two ""-A INPUT"" rules:



--- CODE ----A INPUT -p icmp -j REJECT
--- CODE ---


After this, iptables rules should be reloaded by running



--- CODE ---sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4--- CODE ---
