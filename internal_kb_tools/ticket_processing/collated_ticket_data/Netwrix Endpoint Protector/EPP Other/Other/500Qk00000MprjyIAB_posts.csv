i've installed the EPPClient_rhel_8.10_v2.4.3.1007 client on my redhat/alma/rocky pc's on my network, the machines can pin the appliance and there is now firewall ports blocking traffic, yet the appliance can't see the pc's, as a test i have installed the original linux client (v1.9.1.1) i got when we did the initial trial to check there is no communications issues between appliance and this client talks to the appliance, i can enable devices and block devices.  Any ideas on what i can do?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-12T07:04:01.000Z"
