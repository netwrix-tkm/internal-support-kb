"500Qk00000DgbDNIAZ","00416342","Support Ticket","Hotfix and client in grey","Hi!

In the Dashboard tab, in Live Update we have a hotfix to deploy, but the hotfix is never done, because it always remains in the Live update to be done. When we deploy it, it reaches 100% and it seems to finish, but after a refresh on the page, it appears again.
The hotfix is:
Security Update – EPP Server Hotfix #1.1 – Important Security Updates for EPP Server (HWA-EPP4-U8800)
This update includes important security fixes for EPP Server. All customers are advised to update to this version as soon as possible. Hotfix v1.1.
Remarks: Applies to versions: 5.9.0.0, 5.9.1.0, 5.9.2.0, 5.9.3.0~

Other question we have is:
Clients update. We created the Upgrade Job, selecting the newest version, and clicking in NEXT. But on the selection of the computers, some appear in grey, being unable to be selected. But this clients are not in the newest versions. They are also online and licensed.","","","","solved","","Daniel Anton","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","32.1","Closed - Resolved","Claranet Portugal (OutScope Solutions S.A.)","Helio Ferreira","2024-07-29T10:29:41.000Z","2024-08-30T12:07:37.000Z"
