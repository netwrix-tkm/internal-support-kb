Our customer would like to customize the notifications that appear on the user side. I'm sharing an example in the attachment. They want to modify this warning according to their preferences.

We were able to make the necessary adjustments for CAP, so there’s no issue there. However, we couldn’t do the same for Device Control. How can we achieve this?

Best Regards.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-25T07:05:30.000Z"
