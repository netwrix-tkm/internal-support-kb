Hello Thanushree,

Thank you for getting back to us.

If the test email is not received, then the configuration have some errors.
Have you checked if the authentication details are filled in correctly?

I have noticed that there is no encryption selected, is the SMTP configured to receive all emails?

Looking forward for your response.

Hello Thanushree,

Thank you for getting back to us.

If the test email is not received, then the configuration have some errors.
Have you checked if the authentication details are filled in correctly?

I have noticed that there is no encryption selected, is the SMTP configured to receive all emails?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Thanushree,

Thank you for getting back to us.

If the test email is not received, then the configuration have some errors.
Have you checked if the authentication details are filled in correctly?

I have noticed that there is no encryption selected, is the SMTP configured to receive all emails?

Looking forward for your response.

Best regards,

Hello Thanushree,

Thank you for getting back to us. 

If the test email is not received, then the configuration have some errors. 
Have you checked if the authentication details are filled in correctly? 

I have noticed that there is no encryption selected, is the SMTP configured to receive all emails? 

Looking forward for your response.

Dear Team,

 

We are unable to get the Content Aware alerts to the configured mail ID.

 

As per the system settings tab, we have provided SMTP details as well & enabled the test mail. However we are not able to get the alerts.

 

Kindly help us with the remote session at the earliest.

 

Thank you

Dear Team,

 

We are unable to get the Content Aware alerts to the configured mail ID.

 

As per the system settings tab, we have provided SMTP details as well & enabled the test mail. However we are not able to get the alerts.

 

Kindly help us with the remote session at the earliest.

 

Thank you
