Just it will not notify us until we refresh the page. I won't capture setting changes and will happen while actively navigating around. 

We have been migrating this by using Edge, which seems to hold the session open and be fine.

Any assistance for this would be great, thank you for your time and consideration.","","The session is expiring in chrome and the changes are not applied upon saving.

We had a remote session and performed the resources optimization procedure but the issue persists.

We had another remote session with the customer and increased the PHP memory from 256 to 512MB. This seems to help, and we will check with the client next week.","I asked for details regarding the environment in order to investigate what could cause this issue on the server side.

We have asked for a new remote session with the customer.

We will follow-up with the customer next week.","We performed the resources optimization procedure and increased the PHP memory during our remote sessions. The issue cannot be reproduced by the customer anymore.","","Iosif Muntean","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","","","37.2","Closed - Resolved","Solar Atmospheres, Inc.","Lawrence Yeziorski","2025-02-11T13:47:40.000Z","2025-03-20T17:23:40.000Z"
