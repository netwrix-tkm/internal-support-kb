Our Customer Aladin Bank, got issue after installing Cososys with DPI Enabled.
 
We already try to disabled DPI and then upload speed was normal, do you have any document about DPI flow and do you have suggestion for that?

Awaiting your response

Thank you","","","","Fix included in 5941 release.","","Andre Le Roux","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Other","NONE","","167.3","Closed - Resolved","PT Korelasi Persada Indonesia","Dede Hilmat","2024-09-04T11:44:03.000Z","2025-02-18T18:59:41.000Z"
