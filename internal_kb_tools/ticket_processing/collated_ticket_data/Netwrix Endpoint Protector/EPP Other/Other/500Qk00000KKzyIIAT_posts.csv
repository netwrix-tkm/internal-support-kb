1. How can I customize the dashboard? I did not see an option to edit these. 
2. Can we use a distribution group for alerting? We'd like the alerts to be sent to a ticket system for triage and assignment. I think I know how to work around this but wanted to check first. 
3. When creating a new admin role, I did not see way to customize this. For instance, I'd like to create a group that has device control but not allow them to make changes to the global rights or settings. 
4. Similar to 3, if my support team seems high file transfers in a dashboard, I would now have to add them to a reports view to see whether the activity is unusual. Which would mean giving them access to all of the reports and analysis section rather than allowing a read only option for that section. 

If you'd rather stand up a call to discuss these, I can be available between 9-5 CST","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-07T22:43:56.000Z"
