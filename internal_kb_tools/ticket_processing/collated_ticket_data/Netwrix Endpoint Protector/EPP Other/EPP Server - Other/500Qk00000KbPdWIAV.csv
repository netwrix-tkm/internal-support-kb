"500Qk00000KbPdWIAV","00432060","Support Ticket","Logs not capturing website information correctly","We are experiencing an issue when users upload files to websites, the website captured in the logs indicates a generic amazon site rather than the actual website utilized.  Example:  Uploads to <a href='https://Smartsheets.com' target='_blank'>Smartsheets.com</a> show up in the logs as <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com' target='_blank'>s3.amazonaws.com</a>.  WeTransfer is another website which shows an <a href='https://amazonaws.com' target='_blank'>amazonaws.com</a> site.  Is there anything we can do to get the website used to show up in the logs?  (as an aside, there is an issue with your ticket form, when you select Collector code - Logs and Analysis, Feature is a required form field for which you cannot enter anything and you can thus never submit a ticket)","","-server version: 5940
