@WaitingOnEngineer  Hi Botond, for some sites (like Wetransfer) the file upload destination is different than the site where the upload request was made. For such cases we include also the Origin in the CAP logs, so Destination details will be something like: ""wt-prod-euwest1-storm.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com (Origin: https://wetransfer.com)"". We created a test build with this modificaton:

smb://192.168.14.5/public/groups/_daily_builds/CoSoSys/2025-builds/2025_02_12/EppClient_v6.2.4.0066

@Cristian-Alexandru Halmajan please create a download link.

The customer installed the test build and mostly worked, however they have content remediation active, and if it's used for a file that triggers the policy, the destination detail remains ""s3.amazonaws.com"".
We used app.smartsheet.com for gathering logs, and 2 of the test files were test4 and test6.
Logs and screenshot attached.

Hi Boti,

I hope you are well.

A dev task has been raised and dev team will investigate some options related to what the customer flagged.

There is no ETA on when this will be resolved as right now we do not have a clear solution.

Cristi

Hi Botond, I have created a new test build which includes Origin into remediation CAP logs too.
