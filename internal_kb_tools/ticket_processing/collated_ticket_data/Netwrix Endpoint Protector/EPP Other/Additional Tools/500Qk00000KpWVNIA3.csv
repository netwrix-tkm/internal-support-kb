"500Qk00000KpWVNIA3","00432809","Support Ticket","intermediate certificate of epp server","Dear. Netwrix
We are using netwrix endpoint protector with DPI feature enabled.
At this time, the third-party solution is not operating properly due to a conflict between your company's solution certificate and the third-party solution.
We would like to solve this problem.
We understand that your company's policy does not allow partner engineers to access your servers directly.
Please check my questions regarding this and then respond.

Questions.
1. Based on your company's technical support policy, can you forward to me the intermediate certificate file on our server?
2. If possible, can you tell me how much additional cost or time this will cost?
3. If it is not possible, please review the reason and whether there is a way to make it possible and let us know.
4. If the certificate is changed due to an operation such as upgrading the server version, replacing the IP, or changing the administrator certificate, and the certificate needs to be replaced again... can I assume that the answer to Question 2 will occur again? Can you help without additional resources?

As the situation is urgent, we are waiting for your quick and friendly response.
I hope you have a happy new year.
