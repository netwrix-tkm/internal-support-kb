@WaitingOnEngineer

As Dev queue is extremely overload, and shouldn't be burn for some generic sales questions, to save time and cycles, I'm recommending to first look for answers first:

	 - 	https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/search?bundle=EndpointProtector_5.9.4&personalize=true&q=metadata

	 - 	Ask Sales Engineering colleges who knows most common use case related answers
	 - 	Ask Support collogues first, as most probably they already deal with such case in support perspective. 
	 - 	Ask our CSM team who is also dealing with similar requests.
	 - 	Ask our Sales collogues, especially Zoran. 
Search ADO for keywords. https://dev.azure.com/NetwrixCorporation/CoSoSys-EPP/_search?text=metadata&type=workitem&pageSize=25&filters=Projects%7BCoSoSys-EPP%7D&includeFacets=false
	 - 	Then raise an ticket to DEV. 


Here, you are correct, there is not yet introduced integration with Netwrix Data Classification (it is in future roadmap), but we can deal with metadata of office/pdf files. By creating custom dictionaries you can define the pattern related to NDC metadata.
