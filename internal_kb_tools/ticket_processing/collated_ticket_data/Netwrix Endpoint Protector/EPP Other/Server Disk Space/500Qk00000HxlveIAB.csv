TLDR:
Are you certain there is not already some sort of automatic license releasing going on here, or something similar?  Why are we seeing a difference in licenses when viewing through Device Control>Computers vs System Configuration>System Licensing?
******

We are nearing our License limit and on our Quarterly review, it was recommended to turn on the Automatic Release License feature.  We were informed this will fix anything going forward, but won't remove devices that have already stopped checking in within the defined time interval.  We do not currently have this feature turned on.

After some investigation, we are getting different numbers of computers that are licensed for EPP depending on where we look.

If I go to System Configuration>System Licensing>View Licenses and do an export from here it shows 10001, which matches the current count of Licensed Endpoints under the System Licensing tab.

If I Device Control>Computers and add a Filter for License=Licensed, apply it, and do an Choose action>Export List of Computers, it shows 12525 records.  Even after removing the duplicates based on Serial Number, there were still 10806 entries when I did the export yesterday.

If you back to System Configuration>System Licensing to view the Licenses and filter to Last Online = 90, there are no entries; and when you filter to Last Online = 60, there are 319 entries.

When look under Device Control>Computers and filter for License = Licensed and sort by Last Seen, there are several systems that have a last seen date in 2023, but show Licensed on this list.  Example computer name: ASMH4TGG06TQ6W2.  When I search this same computer in the list of licenses under System Licensing, this computer does not show up on this list.","","","","server upgrade to 5941 fixed the license filtering","","Botond Biro","","Netwrix Endpoint Protector","EPP Other","Server Disk Space","","","44.0","Closed - Resolved","OUHSC","Chisum Thompson","2024-11-06T17:17:30.000Z","2024-12-20T16:16:15.000Z"
