Exchange > 8. Exchange Online > EX_Mailflow_Mailbox I believe has a similar report to what the customer was looking to get with User Traffic

I believe that job is already scheduled in the customers environment. Verify there are no issues with the 0. Collection > EX_Mailflow Job. History/Retention for this job is an analysis task, NOT via global option!

"00aQk000009SzeTIAS","500Qk00000FNztPIAT","The customer is not set up to run Exchange Online.
The customer said they had migrated everything from Ex on-premise to Online
Under the Mailflow settings, I checked the Connection, and it was pointed to the wrong profile (an Active Directory profile), and the Host was targeting the Onpremise Exchange server.
 
Under the primary setting > Connection, I noticed the customer has a Modern Authentication for Exchange Online set up.

I advised the customer to switch the connection profile from Active Directory to ExModernAuth, switch from the On-Prem host to the Onmicrosoft.com host list, and rerun the job.

The job ran and quickly failed. 
When I checked the Connect Status under the Ex_Mailflow job, I discovered the 'Access Denied' under the Status.

I also checked the Azure Inventory job, and it was not set up.
The customer doesn't have access to the Azure Site, and the person with access is unavailable.
 
I explained to the customer with the Azure admin in the meeting to verify the permissions, and I also explained to him we need to set up the Azure Inventory job.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-10-03T19:23:35.000Z","2024-10-03T20:03:24.000Z","false","false"
