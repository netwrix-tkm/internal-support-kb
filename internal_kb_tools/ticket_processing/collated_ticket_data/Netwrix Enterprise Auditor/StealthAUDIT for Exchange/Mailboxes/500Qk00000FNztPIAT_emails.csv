Nicholas, the script finished.  There is less data now on the report however some still remains.  I'm thinking there might be another table we need to remove.  (See Screenshot)   Shoot me over a meeting invite for after you get back from vacation.  Hope you have a relaxing week.","Netwrix Support Ticket #420203 - StealthAudit - Custom Email Counts returning no data","bgustin@glatfelters.com","Bryan Gustin","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-20T15:49:48.000Z","true"

Glad we were able to meet and finally put the finishing touches on this.

The last thing we worked on being the Reports website numbers.

The source of these numbers are in the Solutions.xml for the offending Solution.
path %sainstalldir%jobs Then go into the solution Folder that you want to modify


I would just wipe out the information between the <BigNumbers> and </BigNumbers> and save the file.

Should be able to go back into the published reports site an the NUmbers will be removed.
