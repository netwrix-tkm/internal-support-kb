Here's the resolution notes for our ticket with the new PF_Entitlements job error for your records.

Symptom
After upgrade to 11.6 to include fix for ""AIC Import - PF Entitlements"" analysis task in the ""PF_Entitlements"" job receiving error:

""Column, parameter, or variable #5: Cannot find data type dbo.SA_AIC_FlexibleResourceTypesImport. Must declare the table variable ""@resourcetype"". Parameter or variable '@resourcetype' has an invalid data type.""

Cause
Appears to be related to the ""PF_EntitlementsScan"" job not running before ""PF_Entitlements"" job in order for tables to be properly correlated. This requirement was not mentioned in hotfix notes.

Resolution
Run the ""PF_EntitlementsScan"" job and ensure success before running the updated """"PF_Entitlements"" job.

Subject: After upgrading to 11.6.0.112 to fix issue with PF_Entitlements analysis new error is occurring [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HjPtW:ref ]

Hi Charlie,

Hope you're doing well. I've been doing some lab testing for the 'PF_Entitlements' job in my lab. I was unable to reproduce the error we ran across in your environment, however there were some differences in relation to my lab.

I had not previously ran the 'PF_EntitlementsScan' job located in the Exchange > 5. Public Folders > Permissions > Collection group, so I had to get that setup and run before testing.

As I recall, we had just disabled the 'AIC Import - PF Entitlements' analysis task on the PF_Entitlements job, but everything was setup to run on a schedule.

When you have a moment I'd like to have you test with re-enabling the 'AIC Import - PF Entitlements' task and rerun the 'PF_Entitlements' job to see if the error persists. I'm wondering if there was perhaps a dependency on the scan job having run before we performed our test after the upgrade.

Let me know if you have any questions, or once you've had a chance to test this out what results you're seeing.
