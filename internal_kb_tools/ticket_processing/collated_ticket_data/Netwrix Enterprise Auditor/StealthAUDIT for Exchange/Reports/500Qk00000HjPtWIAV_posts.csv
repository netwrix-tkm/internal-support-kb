AIC is latest 11.6.0.25 mentioned as required by R&D for the hotfix.

Attempted to reproduce in lab but unsuccessful. I did require setting up the PF_EntitlementScans job in lab as this had not been run previously.

In lab database I also do not see the [dbo.SA_AIC_FlexibleResourceTypesImport] in tables, views, stored procedures, or functions either, though the error does not occur.","","","","0054u000006goFUAAY","2024-10-31T19:52:58.000Z"
