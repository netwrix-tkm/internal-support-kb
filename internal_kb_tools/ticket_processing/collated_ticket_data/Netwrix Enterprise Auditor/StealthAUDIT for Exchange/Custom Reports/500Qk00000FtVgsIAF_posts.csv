---------------
finally met with the client

he was following a document created alongside a Netwrix TSE that had set-by-step directions on how to create additional reports like the ones they've already created

It involved creating two analysis tasks to create the desired filtered table
The second task needed to query the table created by the first task
-table wasn't an option when configuring the second task
he was missing a step where he needed to run the first task before creating the second task
-the table hadn't actually been created yet","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-11-01T18:45:08.000Z"
