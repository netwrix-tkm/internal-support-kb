Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, it definitely looks as though the Manager Count report is counting wrong. We exported the job from StealthAUDIT and my team and I are reviewing the sql script to see what can be adjusted. I'll reach out with our next steps shortly.

Thank you,
