The custom report SA_GroupInfo_MailGroupManagerCount report was showing 0 groups with managers, and 0 groups without managers.

The SQL analysis script on the job that does the looks to be incorrect.

[Resolution]
Paul Pitas corrected the script on the job to use the correct tables and columns for counting.
