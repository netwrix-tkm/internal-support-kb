I've took screenshots of database settings, and you've provided me with csv files with output.

Comment from Andy Watson:

So it looks as though it hadn't blown out the tempdb last week but did have an issue with a path being truncated so I think we are definitely in a better place but I'd keep the ticket open for monitoring until we've had a good number of run throughs without the tempdb blowing up. There is more code to update as some of the other sections of code in the direct permissions and other jobs definitely need to be rewritten to stop trying to calculate everything in one go","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-10-30T07:17:22.000Z"

Update from 11.11.2024

Running into issues with SQL Deadlocking when either ADI or EntraADI is running. Running it again today to see if it dies overnight, if so I'm going to tweak the code so it puts the data it needs into custom tables so we can avoid the deadlock","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-11-11T11:17:26.000Z"
