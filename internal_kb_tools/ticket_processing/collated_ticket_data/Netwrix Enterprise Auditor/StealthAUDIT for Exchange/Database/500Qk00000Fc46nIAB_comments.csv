I've created an updated version of the SP_DomainUsers job that will run this weekend (hopefully it'll be faster than the previous version which didn't blow up the TempDB but did time out at 3 days) . If we can keep the ticket open for now and if the job is more successful then we'll be looking to choose the right path for the updated version of the job to be folded into the product so that upgrades don't take us back to the version that works less well in large environments.

Hopefully we'll know next Thursday whether it has worked successfully and we'll be able to figure out whether it wants to go in as an escalation or productboard","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-11-01T12:26:46.000Z","2024-11-01T12:26:46.000Z","false","false"
