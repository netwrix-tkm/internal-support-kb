We also modified permissions for the App Registration in EntraID and assigned required permissions. We also installed the ExchangeManagementOnline module to resolve the PowerShell errors. For some jobs, we were getting a warning that host is offline. We modified the job properties and set it to run by unchecking the option where it skips the hosts that do not respond to ping. For Sensitive Data discovery jobs, we modified the host list to ""office365.outlook.com"" and jobs started running successfully.
