When you have a chance run this script in the SQL server stealthaudit database.

Shouldn't take any tweaking. Just look at the results.

SELECT 
    r.[Email],
    r.[Trustee],
    r.[Permissions]
FROM [dbo].[sa_ex_mailboxaccess_rights] r

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    s.[E-Mail] AS [Email],
    s.[Trustee],
    s.[Permission Level] AS [Permissions]
FROM [dbo].[sa_ex_mailboxaccess_sendas] s order by email

I'll have to pretty it up to put it in a table and report, but that will be the easy part.

This doesn't merge like the one earlier today did but I believe this will show each Email in the Rights table and then also add aditional rows from any Email's that also have SendAs rights. 

The Email will be the mailbox itself, and the Trustee will be the user that has the rights over the email. 

Let me know how that goes. Any feedback if necessary otherwise I can send another invite and we can meet to get it into NEA/Stealthaudit and move on to the metrics jobs.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
