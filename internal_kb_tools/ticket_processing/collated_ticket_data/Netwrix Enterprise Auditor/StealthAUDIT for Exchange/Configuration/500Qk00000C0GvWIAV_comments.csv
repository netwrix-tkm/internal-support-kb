Results from Exchange Delegates job seemingly missing some of the delagates. When compared to the results from the command below.

Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails SharedMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited |

Get-MailboxPermission |

Select-Object Identity, User, AccessRights |

Where-Object { $_.User -like '*@*' } |

Export-Csv -Path C:Tempsharedfolders.csv -NoTypeInformation



Desired Outcome:
Determine why we are not including or gathering full results. If its by design or if its an issue with our jobs filtering.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up shared mailboxes with delegates
2. Run ex delegates job and review results.
3. Run command below and compare results

Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails SharedMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited |
Get-MailboxPermission |
Select-Object Identity, User, AccessRights |
Where-Object { $_.User -like '*@*' } |
Export-Csv -Path C:Tempsharedfolders.csv -NoTypeInformation

Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi

Troubleshooting completed/Notes: 
I was not able to reproduce.

Modified a few delegate results and noticed the command picked them up but the job results did not. So there appears to be something in our job preventing the full results. 

included link to command to replicate outside of NEA.
